being here today it's great to have you

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,840
at this talk and it's great to be here

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,780
at that fest so I am Cheryl this was

5

next door I'm also a proud member and

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,210
founder of the Diana initiative where we

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,029
support women and diversity in tech and

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,680
we had a great second year in Vegas and

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:37,079
I encourage you all to come join us

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:43,170
again next year finally and you can find

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,539
me online as encrypted ok this is our

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,250
essential obligatory disclaimer we all

14
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,140
know what it is but I need to say it so

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,910
that it makes my boss feel better so

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,629
hoopha views and opinions expressed

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,328
herein are mine mine alone and not of

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:02,218
any of my employers past or present or

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:05,280
as far as I know future ok so let me

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,010
present to you our agenda for today we

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
are going to explore an evolution of

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,159
evil and there are many stories to be

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,200
told we are going to question our

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,720
choices with IOT we're going to see who

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,030
is out there we're going to talk about

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:31,789
money and minors and then we're going to

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,790
play a little game of what yes

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:47,000
now who here loves good scary stories

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,330
hahaha me too I like things like the

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,159
Body Snatchers or the chrysalis

31
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,920
you know stuff that takes over the world

32
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,430
well I'm going to present to you a story

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,490
about a router haunted by the very

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,659
firmware within it

35
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,000
well it's aren't something that's new

36
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,820
they have been around for a while and

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,340
they've been steadily evolving past the

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,890
point of annoyances and inconveniences

39
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,680
they have now moved into the enterprise

40
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,299
realm and they have the capability there

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,800
to do a lot more damage

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,140
I work in thread Intel so my job is to

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,500
watch for trends and to identify what

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:31,250
could really impact the bottom line the

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,980
real meaning of business risk well there

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,280
was no question about a trend this

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,730
January right out of the gate massive

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,549
botnets with crypto miners I thought

49
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,429
that was attention worthy the thing is

50
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:50,810
with business it's not a problem until

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:54,200
it's a problem so things kind of changed

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,820
around June with VPN filter and the

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,310
notice from the FBI and I found myself

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,370
staying up late to produce a report on

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:06,380
the new disturbing trend of botnets we

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:10,850
can all agree it's not new but it is now

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:14,510
November and as I see it botnets really

58
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,790
are a clear and present danger we need

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,459
to look past what it is we think we know

60
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:24,019
about these things because something

61
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,329
wicked this way comes so let's get

62
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,859
started shall we

63
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,500
when we think of botnets we usually

64
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,980
think in terms of distributed denial of

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,200
service attacks right it's temporary

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,190
it's an annoyance and an inconvenience

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,530
but it's something that we can get over

68
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,230
well let's talk about that inconvenience

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,709
of a DDoS attack how many people here

70
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,709
use github

71
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,200
you remember what happened in February

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:59,849
of this year that was the biggest

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,140
recorded DDoS attack 1.3 5 terabytes per

74
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:07,500
second that was twice the size of Mirai

75
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,640
now mem crash wasn't a botnet per se it

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,890
was however a bunch of vulnerable

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,579
misconfigured servers that could be made

78
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,949
into a botnet and we know we have a lot

79
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,750
of those servers out there

80
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:24,389
internet-facing that shouldn't be and

81
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,789
they live in enterprises that don't seem

82
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,490
to know this we've got an ongoing

83
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,710
problem with shadow IP but I'm gonna

84
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,010
save that for another talk now how do I

85
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,239
know haha well I had to go looking I

86
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,969
have two words for you Asset Management

87
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,630
done right I swear to god it is going to

88
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,530
save your ass

89
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:51,990
time and again done the way I have seen

90
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:54,650
it you are going to get pwned now I want

91
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,479
to illustrate this point with the use of

92
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,549
misconfigured memcache servers that were

93
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:04,770
accessible by a public internet because

94
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,560
the predecessors were stop me if you've

95
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,900
heard this one before Mongo and couch

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,150
databases how many people have had the

97
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,310
fun of dealing with those last year we

98
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,400
had a massive takeover in terms of

99
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,120
ransomware huge pwnage of Mongo and

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,120
couch databases and you can see how well

101
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,550
that lesson was applied here it's only

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,710
going to keep happening so by way of

103
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,729
quick explanation for people who may not

104
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,919
know what memcache actually means it's

105
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:40,650
memory caching and it's done to help

106
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,530
boost the response time for database

107
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:47,400
driven websites it improves the memory

108
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,859
caching unfortunately so many of these

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,039
had a default insecure configuration

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,380
that it allowed for DDoS attacks against

111
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,120
the UDP packets and these servers

112
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,650
amplified that by 51 thousand times

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,540
that's a lot of bang for the

114
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,130
in the hands of the attackers alright

115
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,120
does everybody here understand or know

116
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:16,469
what the CIA triangle is confidentiality

117
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,860
integrity and availability so it's easy

118
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:23,160
to see in terms of impact how this would

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,979
apply to availability but what if it

120
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,919
also impacts the other two sides of the

121
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,409
triangle according to Martin McKay who

122
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,680
is a global security advocate at Akamai

123
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,840
and a lot of enterprises use Akamai

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,430
there are many countries out there who

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,789
don't even have one point three

126
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,160
terabytes coming in total so to get hit

127
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:50,250
by an attack at this level would take

128
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,660
them down for a very long time well

129
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,020
let's talk about our current favorite

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,020
subject

131
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,139
imagine the apocalypse as crop spots oh

132
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,500
my god why do we have to connect

133
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,780
everything welcome welcome to the

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,620
connected hell of IOT we're set it and

135
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,239
forget it

136
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,300
really is a best practice default

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,000
passwords are de rigueur we have

138
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,669
embedded system vulnerabilities

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,970
everywhere and we have not even factored

140
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,710
in what is a veritable tsunami of

141
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,960
unsecured connected advice devices that

142
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,880
are being acquired by a developing world

143
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,820
so botnets were used by script kiddies

144
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,690
couple years ago in you know spiteful

145
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,659
attacks right

146
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,620
they were grinches who took away Xboxes

147
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,720
and Playstations but now well now we've

148
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,180
got bigger kitties to worry about and

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,199
spiteful attacks those who take on a

150
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,860
whole new meaning botnets are now one

151
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,169
more weapon in a digital arsenal that

152
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:02,520
are the games nation-states play there's

153
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,500
no referee and there's no playbook we

154
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,539
have come to experience the impact of

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,270
DDoS botnets that are built from

156
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,640
hundreds of thousands of compromised

157
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,770
Internet of Things devices and this

158
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,380
represents a rapidly expanding

159
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,690
threat surface the problem is it's

160
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,440
consumer-driven so the race to the

161
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,870
finish line

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,599
leave security so far behind it isn't

163
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,940
even an afterthought and there's there's

164
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,729
little incentive for manufacturers to do

165
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,370
things better and who really wants to be

166
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:38,909
a regulator at the beginning of October

167
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,380
another nine million inherently insecure

168
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:46,450
devices got added to that botnet trough

169
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,089
but it's not just that the device is an

170
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,940
IOT or unmanaged Jeremy Canelli of

171
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:55,300
fireEye says it's that they just get

172
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,920
left out there to languish they're not

173
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,670
updated and the the non-experts who use

174
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:08,040
them have no idea that they've even been

175
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:10,839
compromised so how about this one

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,770
botnets that are built to download other

177
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,360
botnets well that's totally wicked and

178
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:20,640
wicked actually is a botnet which

179
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:24,670
happens to download omni Satori and Sora

180
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,209
the spawn of Mirai so what we have now

181
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,810
is a playground for attackers with

182
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,199
botnets

183
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,290
and aspirations and if they don't see

184
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:40,630
the limits to their creations we should

185
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:43,000
not limit our expectations of attacks so

186
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,490
we all know what happens when source

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,720
code is made public and there are

188
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:52,329
numerous variants of Mirai and Satori

189
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,339
but I want you to think hybrid because

190
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,399
there is source code out there for

191
00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:01,630
Trojans and ransomware and some very

192
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,760
delicious exploits I'm going to let this

193
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,070
one speak for itself if you don't follow

194
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,860
him ba Brutus is probably one of the

195
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,790
best data scientists out there tracking

196
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,250
botnets he works with rapid7 and he has

197
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:22,860
been posting some pretty scary alerts

198
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,860
all year so let's see who's that there I

199
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,570
consider Mirai to be the pivotal moment

200
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,080
how many people here

201
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:37,570
remember fall of 2016 when the East

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:40,450
Coast went down yeah and there was no

203
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,840
Twitter there was no Facebook there was

204
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:50,770
no internet because dine which is one of

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:52,150
the major eyes keys got ddosed I want

206
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,310
you to take a really good look at this

207
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,540
map when I see it

208
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:02,410
I see what an attack by weaponized

209
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,680
botnets would look like only this is

210
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,530
from two years ago at stage three of the

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,560
Moriah attack and the cost of businesses

212
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:18,569
was significant so let's look at some of

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,569
the major botnets since Mirai

214
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,349
mom Andrew this is where it all began

215
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:30,189
for me when I saw really what marked a

216
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:34,300
pivot from DDoS to monetized attack

217
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,160
vectors mom Andrew was a giant mining

218
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,349
rig one of the biggest and most

219
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,680
successful crypto jacking botnets that

220
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,600
was active and botnets in crypto mining

221
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,930
go together like horse and carriage

222
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,740
completely this one netted 2.3 billion

223
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:54,370
dollars and it leveraged eternal blue to

224
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,760
find and a slave more devices it used

225
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,590
Windows management infrastructure so

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,990
that it could manage and configure those

227
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,750
BOTS and this was not something we were

228
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:11,500
seeing in other botnets until this point

229
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:15,040
ah hi defeat so this came out in January

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,790
it was only the second botnet to have

231
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,319
peer-to-peer architecture versus

232
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,740
conventional command and control why

233
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,110
peer-to-peer much harder to track it

234
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,950
also had a worm like spreading mechanism

235
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,410
so that it could rapidly infect it

236
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,990
differed from the other botnets that

237
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,400
were out there but in the world of

238
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,160
botnets being different seems to be a

239
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,530
very good thing it was constantly being

240
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,380
redesigned with more complex features

241
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,380
being

242
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,970
added because why does DDoS when you can

243
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,280
do data exfil code execution and

244
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:56,810
interfere with device operation this is

245
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:59,569
a bot that's going places ah but in May

246
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:03,890
it came back with even more the magic

247
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,200
word is persistence this my friends is a

248
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,640
game-changer because before that you

249
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,840
could flush them out of your system with

250
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:16,010
a reboot not anymore

251
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:19,930
in July they enhance the system further

252
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:24,980
and added those database servers and

253
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:27,890
then in September hahaha well we know

254
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,280
how many of these are there Android

255
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,280
devices

256
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:38,420
then there's Milo bot this one is all

257
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,910
about the attack holy crap it is

258
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,319
designed for malware versus malware

259
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,020
Moore's I didn't even know that was a

260
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,230
thing it can hunt for and disable

261
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,620
malware on its competitors its surfaced

262
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,760
from the dark web back in June and it

263
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,470
had an unheard-of level of complexity

264
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:02,480
understandably with its various tools

265
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:04,610
and evasion techniques these are anti VM

266
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,950
anti sandbox and anti Deepak you don't

267
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,540
see that in botnets its innards are

268
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:15,350
obfuscated because they have it wrapped

269
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,300
in an encrypted resource file it does

270
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,750
code injection and it does something

271
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,240
kind of cool call process hollowing so

272
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,130
an attacker creates a new process that

273
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,600
is in a suspended state and then

274
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:35,510
replaced this again is highly advanced

275
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:38,030
for what typically is a DDoS vehicle now

276
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,710
the malware on this is nested in three

277
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,140
layers one on top of the other each

278
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,480
layer responsible for executing the

279
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,780
layer above it ending with the final one

280
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,420
and the final one uses reflective exe

281
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,790
technology so that it can execute its

282
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,550
exe files from memory without having

283
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,969
them on disk because obfuscation is the

284
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,248
name of the

285
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,029
we all know how hard it is if something

286
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:03,589
is run in memory and not in disk pretty

287
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:07,309
much everything takes place in memory

288
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:10,039
with this and my Lobot it can download

289
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:12,559
whatever it's bought herders wish so if

290
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:19,519
you want ransomware crypto jacking

291
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:21,409
banking Trojans spyware it's ready how

292
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,279
many of us got that FBI noticed back in

293
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:29,059
June haha half a million Soho routers

294
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,419
across 54 countries and this malware

295
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:35,539
strain it is incredibly complex compared

296
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:37,519
to other IOT malware out there it was

297
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:41,839
the second one to be equipped with

298
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,869
better support for persistence after

299
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,079
reboot this one also scans for SCADA

300
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:51,349
components think critical infrastructure

301
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,799
power grids and it has a function to

302
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:57,169
wipe firmware and incapacitate effective

303
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,709
devices this is definitely a

304
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:03,429
nation-state tool now Cisco Talos did a

305
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,868
series of really good in-depth blogs

306
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,419
analyzing the features and the evolution

307
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,879
of this over time what it discovered was

308
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:14,059
this had code overlapped with black

309
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,039
energy which happens to be the malware

310
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,439
used in the two attacks against the

311
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:24,439
Ukrainian power grid in December of 2015

312
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:26,748
and 2016 it's still being developed it's

313
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:29,719
still getting enhancements according to

314
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:32,689
Talos yes in fact it's new and improved

315
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,009
with seven third-stage modules like port

316
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:39,738
forwarding a socks5 proxy and a tcp VPN

317
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:48,589
on the infected device From Russia With

318
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:51,109
Love and that brings me to tour I the

319
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:55,579
latest evolution in weaponized botnet

320
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:58,809
experiments this one offers a very wide

321
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:01,549
range of multiple CPUs now that's

322
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:04,689
typical for Mirai variants but what's

323
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:07,398
not typical is the sheer number of

324
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:09,150
variants and platforms that this works

325
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:10,859
on

326
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,410
security researcher who found it

327
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:17,189
discovered that it was tunneling through

328
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:19,560
tor again this is something new and the

329
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,860
botnet target systems with telnet

330
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,730
exposed huh and weak credentials oh what

331
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,209
a surprise

332
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:30,300
but it determines what the system is and

333
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:33,510
then it uses several versions of the

334
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:37,139
same command to achieve payload delivery

335
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,740
and this botnet if you haven't figured

336
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,300
it out by now is lucky number three for

337
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,720
persistence oh my god we've got three of

338
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:49,260
them out there now so it runs six

339
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,300
methods concurrently to ensure that not

340
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,050
only does it get loaded but that it

341
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,000
stays running you can however kick it

342
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,780
off by setting things back to their

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,750
default settings if you're able to my

344
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,840
point nobody knows what the hell this

345
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,420
was designed for it doesn't show any

346
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:14,270
indication of being meant to DDoS

347
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:19,040
something or launch crypto miners

348
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,040
exactly we need to expect the unexpected

349
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:31,790
well show me the money who here works in

350
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:35,550
financial institutions banking etc okay

351
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:37,830
so account takeover is a very big deal

352
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,950
this year we have seen the numbers

353
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,830
pretty much skyrocket attackers are

354
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,620
using botnets in mass efforts for

355
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,000
malicious logins Akamai said that it

356
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:53,639
went from 3.2 billion around January

357
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,330
just the period from January to April to

358
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,660
eight point three billion from April to

359
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:03,240
May now this is called credential

360
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,740
stuffing where botnets steal information

361
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:11,100
for logins like across the internet and

362
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,530
not just Fi is at risk every single

363
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,570
business is that risk of this it's an

364
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,399
enormous cost to the financial

365
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,260
institutions and organizations and it

366
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,690
just is an uphill battle for us to fight

367
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,379
there are days for example when when the

368
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,700
bank site

369
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,220
just being hammered and we look at the

370
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:30,960
log reports and you can see the massive

371
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,660
spikes it looks like a DDoS attack but

372
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,530
it's much more serious we're also

373
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,930
learning that botnets go undetected when

374
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:43,770
they make their attack methods low and

375
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:47,910
slow they do it carefully over time

376
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:55,050
across several organizations and they

377
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:57,120
stay in the game without takedown well

378
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:01,020
let's talk about botnets and banking

379
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,439
Trojans black botnet is a proxy botnet

380
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:08,460
so that's a chain of proxies that again

381
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,350
are much harder to track and detect it's

382
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,060
delivering the Ramnath banking Trojan

383
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,909
which has been taken down by law

384
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:18,450
enforcement at least twice and this is

385
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,400
its latest incarnation in March we had

386
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,040
the gozi banking Trojan being delivered

387
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,520
by the dark cloud botnet now the dark

388
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,990
cloud botnet is it's representing a new

389
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,180
trend where delivery as a service is

390
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,730
coming into play because it offers

391
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,480
services to deliver malware from several

392
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,230
different families it also uses hijacked

393
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,660
computers to change the DNS name

394
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,340
repeatedly we're talking 287 different

395
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,020
addresses just over a 24-hour period

396
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,090
necker's is a botnet you may have heard

397
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,010
of because it's familiar in terms of its

398
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,870
spam delivery it is notorious for that

399
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,879
but in August it did an interesting

400
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,540
pivot and it started directly going

401
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,150
after bank employees sending them

402
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,120
phishing emails and then passing along

403
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,540
the flawed Amy rat and last but

404
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,100
definitely definitely not least is

405
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Imhotep this is a huge issue for us in

406
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,429
banking but I think it's gonna be an

407
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,379
enormous issue just about for anybody

408
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,260
because it's experienced such a massive

409
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,180
level of growth it's it's over 50% of

410
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,000
the malware that we're detecting every

411
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,110
day there is something major with

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,970
Imhotep and it is now evolved into that

413
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:39,270
multi-purpose full service

414
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,640
that delivers other malware it's also

415
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:44,790
gone on to spawn quack bot which again

416
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,760
is targeting fi and brokerages and quack

417
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,310
bot leverages the powers of powershell

418
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,420
and mini cats because we all know the

419
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,419
value of living off the land

420
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:03,270
so if 2017 was about ransomware 2018 is

421
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,220
all about crypto miners and there have

422
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:08,610
been some significant pivots in terms of

423
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,160
individual level to enterprise it's not

424
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,949
about Bitcoin and Monera themselves but

425
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,980
what it takes to mine cryptocurrency

426
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,520
it's resource intensive and it just

427
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,950
devours both power and CPU which of

428
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,010
course is the reason behind the move to

429
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:29,760
enterprise systems all of those servers

430
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,830
all of that power yum especially in the

431
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,710
land of data centers and cloud-based

432
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:39,629
resources so when these are detected

433
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:42,150
which is hard because nobody's looking

434
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,240
for those big spikes and power and CPU

435
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:48,420
in those places they will get flagged as

436
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,090
potentially unwanted applications so

437
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,370
since they're not red flag to something

438
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,379
we already know not much is likely to

439
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:59,729
get Donny coin miners can be executables

440
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,940
they can be browser-based

441
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:07,140
or they can even now be file Asst and

442
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,200
they run on nearly every platform my

443
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:14,430
concern is the growing use of exploits

444
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,380
like eternal blue that get combined with

445
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,030
new exploits against vulnerable

446
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,140
enterprise systems

447
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:23,610
case in point would be the recent

448
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,430
critical vulnerability this summer on

449
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,479
Oracle WebLogic who here has Oracle

450
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:34,230
running in their enterprise systems ok

451
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,320
so what what happened was we got the

452
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,570
notification of a critical and I mean

453
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,629
critical vulnerability and within 2

454
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,770
freaking days there was an exploit and

455
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,340
proof-of-concept

456
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:50,180
out there on several different sources

457
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:54,030
actively being utilized

458
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:56,120
now a heads up we need to be watching

459
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,639
for an exploit tool known as Jack's boss

460
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,989
which is doing the same thing on JBoss

461
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,220
servers and there's a whole lot of

462
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:08,070
middleware out there the reason in 2016

463
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,410
when we saw the pivot for ransomware it

464
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,350
utilized and leveraged a jex box

465
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:18,420
exploit against vulnerable older

466
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,260
unpatched middleware Symantec says that

467
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,080
it locked

468
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,010
eight million attacks just in December

469
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,740
of 2017 and Z scalar says that attackers

470
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,410
attempted to compromise 30 percent of

471
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,650
the vulnerable systems just globally

472
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,720
within a 24 hour period I don't think

473
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,450
they're exaggerating so what if your

474
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,630
systems are patched and up to date you

475
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,100
are still at risk to browser-based

476
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,710
attacks and this happens to have been

477
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,020
one of the fastest growing areas for

478
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:55,220
attackers because the barrier to entry

479
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:57,870
is low in June the paola botnet hit over

480
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,360
40,000 web servers modems and IOT

481
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,510
devices for crypto mining and redirected

482
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,179
users to malicious websites it leveraged

483
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:09,120
multiple vulnerabilities and it brute

484
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,340
forced credentials the victims were

485
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,889
infected with a Manero minor and then

486
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:18,419
the r2 r2 worm which helped it to

487
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:21,450
propagate it also installed a backdoor

488
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:27,300
on CMS platforms that were running web

489
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:29,640
sites and when you hear Apache struts

490
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:33,139
you probably know it's bad and I'm

491
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,660
talking equifax bad but it gets worse

492
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:41,310
because now I add the magic words

493
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:44,160
eternal blue zealot offers a whole new

494
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,940
level of attack vectors it automatically

495
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,920
delivers malware on internal networks

496
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,960
through web application vulnerabilities

497
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,640
and we know there are so many of those

498
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,570
and it's really hard to stay on top of

499
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,600
it it exploits Apache struts which

500
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,840
everybody seems to love to do it uses

501
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,570
eternal blue and

502
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:10,070
other infamous NSA tools to propagate

503
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:12,200
inside those internal networks and then

504
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,600
at the heart of it are the easily

505
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,920
compromised routers and the router

506
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:24,560
choice mic Roddick or however you like

507
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:27,400
to say it which quickly went from bad to

508
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:34,310
worse because the attackers moved up to

509
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,740
carrier-grade routers almost six months

510
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:41,710
later and the attackers are still

511
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,710
finding more ways to poem more routers

512
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:50,380
the fact is attacks evolve so we need to

513
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,909
ask where could attackers go with this

514
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,730
what if they are leveling up to

515
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,370
nation-states borrowing their state

516
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,180
tools and attacks using their bag of

517
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,489
tricks well in this more the devices

518
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,830
that make up an army don't need to be

519
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,540
sophisticated when you have so many the

520
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,159
attackers are literally winning in terms

521
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:15,830
of quantity over quality but that's now

522
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,860
how much damage could weaponize botnets

523
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,810
do given what we've seen we should be

524
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,350
able to estimate their capability to

525
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:28,220
create extensive outages and to deliver

526
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,409
malicious payloads what is it that we're

527
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:35,020
not taking into consideration in terms

528
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:38,390
of what attackers could leverage next

529
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,400
most botnets have tasks to fulfill which

530
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,010
means they need to call home that

531
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,160
reveals the CNC server so that you can

532
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:48,560
eventually track them down here would be

533
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,780
the next pivot what if they don't have

534
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,159
to call home what if they've just got

535
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:57,350
one job go forth and spread propagate so

536
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,360
what we're talking about here is a were

537
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,129
mobile botnet that is self propagating

538
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,020
and leveraging some of the best

539
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,720
available exploits out there like

540
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,139
eternal blue and friends no human

541
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,880
intervention required up until now

542
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,120
botnets have mostly been monetized for

543
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,280
DDoS and sold on the darknet

544
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,800
but Mirai changed that and

545
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,990
was used in retribution in a targeted

546
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,960
attack against Brian Krebs and then

547
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,830
again in another targeted attack against

548
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:32,360
a major isp in France DDoS became a

549
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:33,649
weapon not just an outage so let's take

550
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,760
a moment and talk a little bit more

551
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,920
about were mobile and self-propagating

552
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,530
damage Michelangelo it overwrote the

553
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,100
hard drive and Master Boot Record how

554
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:49,660
about massive storm worm created a

555
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,179
massive botnet wrap it in far-reaching

556
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,820
the Morris worm spread faster than its

557
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,010
originator ever considered and couldn't

558
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,110
gain control back over it there was no

559
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,850
way for them to reach out think about

560
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,949
that in terms of today how about cost

561
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,169
well both code code read 1 & 2 were

562
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,940
among the most expensive in terms of the

563
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,630
damage that they cost two hundred

564
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,990
million dollars daily if you want

565
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,480
long-lasting conficker which lyn lives

566
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,160
in the land of ICS and SCADA and it is

567
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,820
the bane of their existence because it

568
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,970
just propagates freely in those older

569
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,850
unpatched systems there's 2 million new

570
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,960
infections a year and last but not least

571
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:40,159
for sophistication

572
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:43,820
there is Stuxnet just recently there was

573
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,460
a worm going after Android devices we

574
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,129
know there's a ton of those miss

575
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,440
configuration has been an ongoing issue

576
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,290
and we just don't seem to be getting a

577
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,600
handle on it so yeah I would consider

578
00:29:54,290 --> 00:30:01,730
that to be a perfect storm so let's say

579
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,480
from an attackers viewpoint which one

580
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,780
would you pick and why definitely hide

581
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,000
and seek for persistence and it's tools

582
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:15,350
if we want a good attack bot we've got

583
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Milo bot sophistication look no further

584
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:23,209
than VPN filter let's talk about

585
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,230
harnessing powerful exploits through

586
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:29,280
house elet is using them and then tor I

587
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:33,650
where we leverage the power of tor

588
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,570
and we have multi-purpose multiplatform

589
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,460
what do you get when you combine

590
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,830
unpatched vulnerabilities existing

591
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,020
nation-state exploits millions of

592
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,199
inflatable inherently insecure devices

593
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,350
and self-propagating malware and what if

594
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,570
you could use time-delay

595
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:55,290
so that you could evade notice and you

596
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,020
could make less noise leverage multiple

597
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:02,790
attack methods based on operating

598
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:08,280
systems and establish persistence oh and

599
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:13,200
it's all automated let's have some fun

600
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:16,260
with this shall we okay I'm not

601
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,030
technical so this should serve as fair

602
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:24,150
warning since we talked about lowering

603
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:31,160
the bar for entry so please do not run

604
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:38,850
with scissors oh my god you can YouTube

605
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:40,800
anything now I found this on hack forums

606
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,060
when I went looking but as much as I

607
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:49,290
liked all of you I didn't want to pay

608
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:51,360
$25 so I sat down and thought what is

609
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,970
the plan I bought her dinners standard

610
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,560
business plan is to use exploit kits and

611
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,880
then get somebody to click on what you

612
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,970
send out right they'll click on a

613
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:05,340
dangerous link and deposit the payload

614
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:06,870
on their machine design matters we don't

615
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,820
want to be trapped we need to use peer

616
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:13,889
to peer we need to have a good hosting

617
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,240
source bulletproof is the word that kept

618
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,610
coming up which essentially means

619
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,430
services in Russia that really do not

620
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:24,060
care what you run because they have no

621
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:27,680
fear we need to build something called

622
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:31,649
acid of a stub is the infecting file and

623
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:36,660
then we need to build a krypter to wrap

624
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:38,820
that up so nobody can see it then we

625
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:42,170
need to go find a vulnerability with a

626
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,939
lot of devices probably a router

627
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:48,290
and finally we're going to need a brat

628
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:54,860
because we need to do some remote

629
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:56,720
handiwork on this so I went looking for

630
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,500
a bulletproof hosting service while I

631
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,309
was cooking dinner but as you can see

632
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,190
there is an excellent selection of them

633
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:08,270
usually overseas usually Russian and

634
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,580
pastebin is a great source for things

635
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,110
you don't always have to go down into

636
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,970
the murky depths of the dark web

637
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:19,070
in fact you rarely have to I found this

638
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,540
hoster and I want to show you some of

639
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:25,330
the interesting stuff that's on there

640
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:29,600
look at that Jeep on loader or how about

641
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:32,360
that checks box vulnerability scanner we

642
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,299
were just talking about that one oh and

643
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,510
there's a couple of other choice

644
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:42,110
exploitable like Drupal get in and the

645
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:47,360
cubot API I'll just leave that with you

646
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:49,840
so we've got our bulletproof post now we

647
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,969
need a stub and we need a krypter I

648
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,000
checked out the offerings on hack form

649
00:33:52,970 --> 00:34:00,650
and you can see there is an excellent

650
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,950
selection of choices there so I thought

651
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,630
this looked good it works on a full

652
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,810
range of Windows and I'm more familiar

653
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,389
with Windows systems anyway it has a

654
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,350
Terms of Service because there is honor

655
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,429
among thieves

656
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:18,949
really and the price point seemed quite

657
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:22,010
reasonable and you know what else this

658
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:25,480
already gives me a private stuff I've

659
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:28,119
got a stub and a krypter all together

660
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm good

661
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,169
finally we need a rat remember I said

662
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,020
I'm not technical I need some help and

663
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:38,118
YouTube is great so I watched the whole

664
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,009
video of how to build myself a rat and

665
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,830
this was I hate to say it quite

666
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,540
idiot-proof and it showed me exactly

667
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:48,259
which boxes to click on my router

668
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,690
configuration which ports what to set up

669
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,490
so that I too could have a router that

670
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,700
goes and does dirty deeds done dirt

671
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,699
cheap

672
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:03,610
now what we need is the source code to

673
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,590
build our botnet again github and

674
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:10,660
paceman are really really good choices

675
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:12,700
for this stuff I found this and I liked

676
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,990
it because it's a UFO net but apparently

677
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,480
a lot of other people like it as well

678
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,839
and it actually was really

679
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,820
straightforward to follow you can build

680
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,210
a botnet for free if you just follow the

681
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,430
instructions online

682
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:31,090
it's got zombies and aliens I mean I

683
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:38,109
hate to say it it was really fun this

684
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:41,530
will be my simulated demo and there you

685
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:45,010
go pretty much you have now built a

686
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:49,990
botnet and you have a stub and a krypter

687
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:52,240
and a bulletproof host and a rat now we

688
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,569
talked about having an exploit on

689
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,830
multiple devices this is a router

690
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:01,990
infection from the hajime botnet just as

691
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,340
an illustration there are really a whole

692
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,990
lot more that you can pick and choose

693
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:10,840
from now if you want to upgrade your

694
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,319
source code here's some Mirai that you

695
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,690
could probably copy/paste successfully

696
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,660
or Satori

697
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:25,510
or Sora which is actually really nasty

698
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:32,430
stuff and then don't forget your crypto

699
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:37,390
miners now while this is far from over

700
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,140
my talk is so bring on the flames and

701
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,580
pitchforks

702
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,680
because botnets truly are a problem what

703
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,310
do we need to do we know we need to

704
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,609
monitor certain ports because the

705
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:53,920
attackers definitely are they're going

706
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,630
to use their exploit kits they're going

707
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,660
to hunt us down and find us on a lot of

708
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:02,920
open-source software that we are already

709
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:06,790
familiar with the importance of patching

710
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,830
cannot be overstated and it's not just

711
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,820
on routers it's on anything that

712
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:16,120
connects and we really need to find a

713
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,670
way now to watch for these creatures in

714
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,190
our Enterprise realm because that's

715
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:26,860
where they're living and thriving pretty

716
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:30,250
much undetected I put a few resources up

717
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,320
and I will post this on my site after

718
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,420
today so that people can have access to

719
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,790
it there are a lot of excellent

720
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:43,770
write-ups like I suggested Cisco Talos

721
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:46,000
and their VPN coverage and BA Brutus and

722
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,980
because it was it's still almost

723
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,590
Halloween and that's it

724
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:54,880
are there any questions all right thank

725
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,180
you very very much for coming from my

726
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,530
talk

727
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,529
[Applause]
