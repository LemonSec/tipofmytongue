00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,620
alright hey everybody my name is Jay

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,200
Liguori oh and I'm gonna give you kind

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,210
of an app SEC talk today talking about

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,709
how to find things on the internet that

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,429
developers really shouldn't be putting

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,920
on the Internet

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm gonna go a little bit into Who I am

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,300
just because I have to they told me what

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,060
do I want how do I get it where can I

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,070
find that how can I be the laziest as

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,788
possible while still achieving my goal

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,859
the results that I found what to do if I

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,590
am unfortunately a victim of this

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,070
terrible sin what I would do next and

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,260
and then I'll take questions um so Who

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,960
am I my name is Jay I went to school in

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,300
Maryland I also got a master's at the

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,670
Naval Postgraduate School it's a great

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,019
place both our great places learned a

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,590
lot and had a lot of fun

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,180
I've various certifications here and

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,710
there hopefully that's not the most

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,949
important thing to you because they

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,899
shouldn't be and I'm a developer I'm an

26
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,358
IT consultant I'm also a private

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,939
investigator licensed out of DC I've

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,430
done many many projects both at at

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,350
school as a student for myself I work

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,770
for a Maryland based ambulance company I

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,759
took them from a single tower server

32
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:20,250
sitting in a broom closet to a to a data

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,680
center type room with air conditioning

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,900
and five R axes of systems and I'm very

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,119
proud of how they've grown over the last

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,299
10 years and I've worked in many sectors

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,460
and also for myself so back in the day

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,650
if anybody remembers the pocket pcs

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,869
right PDAs that didn't really have

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,509
Internet connectivity but there were

41
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,310
these fold-out keyboards and for

42
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,320
whatever reason Microsoft never wired up

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,649
the the keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,630
Word so I built a I built an app and

45
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,729
distribute it on the Internet and got a

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,589
lot of play out of that which was which

47
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,350
was pretty encouraging back in the days

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,270
before App Store's last I last i checked

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,919
before i took it offline i got about a

50
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,860
million downloads back when you really

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,140
wanted to have an app on your on your

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,630
system so that's that's kind of where I

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,330
started and where when 32 kind of kind

54
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,000
of took hold of me from then on also

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,680
moved into dotnet unfortunately I wrote

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
a Facebook API wrapper

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,579
for.net back before they really had that

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,170
so sorry for everything that came after

59
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:25,109
it was written up in a book without my

60
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,819
not my prior knowledge so even even as

61
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:29,069
of maybe last month or the month before

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,048
I would get enquiries as to whether I

63
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,179
was going to update that that ten-year

64
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,290
old thing and no no I'm not no it's

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,310
terrible

66
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,780
I also do a lot of software re if if

67
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,730
you've ever heard of the night scout

68
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,209
foundation they do a lot of help for

69
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,280
people with certain disabilities and and

70
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,799
one thing that I that I did for them and

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,230
what their help was was try to make a

72
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,780
piece of medical equipment accessible

73
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,268
with just from Windows Store apps and

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,280
for whatever reason the the the

75
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,200
equipment designer decided to do this

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
terrible thing where you would you would

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,780
call from a Java applet through J&I to a

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,489
C driver to to talk to this thing and

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,930
who knows why they did it but it was not

80
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,519
that great turns out you could just do

81
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,370
everything you need to do with an INF

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,219
file so so I went and AH read that with

83
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,109
them and yet just to just generally

84
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,049
curious but law abiding troublemaker I'm

85
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,090
not here trying to go to jail

86
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,209
so so we're gonna move on to what do I

87
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,949
want now as an au centre I want to find

88
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,299
cool stuff on the internet that probably

89
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,979
shouldn't be on the internet and because

90
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,590
I'm feeling like a nice person today I'm

91
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,449
gonna engage in responsible disclosure

92
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,889
so what's cool stuff that developers

93
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,260
shouldn't be putting out there that's

94
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,629
private keys and crypto material that's

95
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,569
API keys and secrets configuration files

96
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:48,418
and creds creds are huge in today's

97
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,138
breaches and open buckets with sensitive

98
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,250
data and I want to find my private data

99
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,810
unexpectedly on the internet like I want

100
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,290
to call myself out on doing dumb stuff

101
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,840
that I might not realize that I'm doing

102
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,358
but trolling for data randomly on the

103
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,970
internet is labor-intensive the payoff

104
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,000
is good though there's an O and umpteen

105
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,650
million number of credentials found in

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,900
countless pastes I'll talk about paste

107
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,970
bundle in a little bit the ante public

108
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,168
credential list in 2017 that was

109
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,488
referred to from a paste

110
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:22,469
Verizon put a ton of a ton of customer

111
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,270
data on the Internet in a bucket chrome

112
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,880
Tech Security Center found that they

113
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,900
also found FedEx more customer data on

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,510
the Internet

115
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,080
Capital one up guard found a bucket more

116
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,900
come more customer data GoDaddy 2018 up

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,870
guard found a bucket and just last month

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,640
pocket I net a little regional ISP

119
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,770
Wireless ISP on the west coast of the

120
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,219
United States they had data on the

121
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,380
internet in a bucket and and we're gonna

122
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,150
go through some of that now the pace are

123
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,280
many varied in an infinite but buckets

124
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,659
really do get you a ton of bang for your

125
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,979
buck they're a little hard to find so

126
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,060
we're gonna go through some strategies

127
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,830
on how you would find that stuff now

128
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,080
buckets just having data on the internet

129
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,320
doesn't sound that bad right so this is

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,750
from pocket pocket I net it doesn't seem

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,159
that bad right it it's a it's a picture

132
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,470
of some infrastructure that they have in

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,450
a data center it it sort of demonstrates

134
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,430
a little lack of duty of care right it's

135
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,610
very sloppy it's not gonna win you any

136
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,900
awards on the reddit cable porn sub but

137
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,060
but it's you know it's there it's not so

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,799
bad but this might be a little more

139
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,780
sensitive now I have a logical diagram

140
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,790
of infrastructure running in their

141
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,469
network and that's that's not so bad you

142
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,220
know it's not creds to those things wait

143
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,720
a second maybe it might be now maybe

144
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,640
this is just random people in the

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
business units that are salespeople they

146
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,419
don't have admin creds to anything

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,070
except when you go through it yeah

148
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,390
that's a it's a little sensitive so

149
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,659
buckets are really cool they're

150
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,630
everywhere and that's just general data

151
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,520
searching now targeted red teaming

152
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,280
that's still also pretty labor-intensive

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,960
and I'm still pretty lazy and so you

154
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,880
have to do sub domain searching you have

155
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,799
to do repost gate scraping you have to

156
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,070
find the API endpoints and you have to

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,410
have find the actual confidential data

158
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,300
and you can do this manually using

159
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,130
keywords but again you're doing it

160
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,060
you're doing it yourself and again I

161
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,800
don't have time for that so computers

162
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,750
should be doing things that I don't want

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,610
to do because I'm lazy I don't want to

164
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,070
manually search for all this cool stuff

165
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,900
I want to brought to me because I'm lazy

166
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,150
so what I need is this merciless

167
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,120
automation I need something to do it for

168
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,400
me again because I'm lazy and ideally

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,950
I'd like to have a front-end that lets

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,060
me go through what it all found even if

171
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,260
it kind of sucks it's better than

172
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,630
nothing

173
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,800
so where can I get all of this data we

174
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,190
talked about or I

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,639
introduce pastebin it's very easy it's a

176
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,919
it's a text-based take your text it take

177
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,289
your text put it on this this site and

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,628
hit submit and there it is just raw text

179
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,699
it's very easy for developers to go

180
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,220
ahead and put that that kind of thing

181
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,860
out there and they don't take steps for

182
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,740
whatever reason to protect it to make it

183
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,240
hidden really in any sort of way I guess

184
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,159
it's because they don't have a good

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,539
collab tool I mean it's really not

186
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,819
something that we can ever know but

187
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:15,060
people are just shoving sensitive code

188
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,370
into paste bin and it shows up API keys

189
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,740
salts hard coded creds all kinds of

190
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,280
stuff like that and pastebin even gives

191
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,699
you a map for a very easy place to hit

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,440
for how-to in near-real-time scrape its

193
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,840
site so that you can see things as

194
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,270
they're going up and it's also very cost

195
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,919
effective if it's not on sale it's fifty

196
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,310
bucks once for a lifetime subscription

197
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,840
if it is on sale it's thirty bucks so

198
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,569
you can get into it pretty easily and

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,599
and it is not hard they give you a REST

200
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,919
API endpoint you hit that thing and it

201
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,949
it gives you the data that you're

202
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,568
looking for now we also have github you

203
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:53,789
know I I want to look for developers

204
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,529
making dumb mistakes so I'm gonna go

205
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:58,830
where they live which is the social

206
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,930
media of so source code repos now I'm a

207
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,969
developer and I do stupid stuff I put it

208
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,580
on the on the the Internet all the time

209
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,380
surely there are other developers doing

210
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,719
the same thing I'm not unique I'm not

211
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,050
very special in any ways way shape or

212
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:15,449
form so you plug keywords into the into

213
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,669
the search box and you find those things

214
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,169
that shouldn't be there but again that's

215
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,049
very manual that's very time-consuming

216
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,090
and I don't want to do that now the one

217
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,159
good thing github gives us is it doubles

218
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,289
as a platform for responsible disclosure

219
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,909
you can open a pull request tell the

220
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,039
developer hey there's something out here

221
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,078
you probably need to get rid of that and

222
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,429
then they ignore you when they don't but

223
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:39,510
we'll go through some examples where

224
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:42,120
where we've tried that now

225
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,449
the other four other source of data that

226
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,020
I described was was s3 buckets there are

227
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:51,029
other others forms of buckets as well

228
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,459
but buckets are giant treasure troves of

229
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,080
data Microsoft has a has an equivalent

230
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,619
so does digital

231
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,220
and as we've seen in Pocket inet there's

232
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,590
lots of useful data that probably

233
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,270
shouldn't be on there you can put nearly

234
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,970
anything on there with near unlimited

235
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,240
file size and it's really easy to access

236
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,800
you just hit an HTTP endpoint and a

237
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,750
domain name there are a few other forms

238
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,130
to access buckets and we'll talk about

239
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,520
that but really this is just the

240
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,689
simplest way now finding these it takes

241
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,230
some effort so let's talk about

242
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,220
strategies for that there's a guy out in

243
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,840
Virginia who collects buckets and the

244
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,820
and the names of those so that other

245
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,580
researchers can just go and hit those

246
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,040
buckets and try to find flaws in them he

247
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,680
adds to the list periodically not all

248
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,880
buckets are publicly accessible now but

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,680
really you do never know when

250
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,720
permissions will change in the Verizon

251
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,300
Wireless disclosure that I mentioned

252
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,590
that bucket was originally private and

253
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,540
there was an error made in the

254
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,060
configuration later on that opened it up

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,660
to everybody and you can pull this list

256
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,829
that he has the arrests API check things

257
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
that you've already checked you know

258
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,150
just make sure that things are things

259
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,250
remain secure and when they don't you

260
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,770
know ring a bell about it and there are

261
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,130
about 20,000 buckets in this list now

262
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,900
that's that is someone's manual process

263
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,270
you know that is his manual process and

264
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,860
we're all about getting rid of manual so

265
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,020
the other thing that we can look at is

266
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,050
search stream when a certificate is

267
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,210
issued by reputable certificate

268
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,740
generators or certificate authorities

269
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,250
they generate a certificate transparency

270
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,570
log and those go out into this search

271
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,120
stream in near-real-time

272
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,650
it's it's something that you can check

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,040
you can watch it for yourself to make

274
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:41,010
sure nobody is creating certificates in

275
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,319
for your domains so really useful for

276
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,120
that and now since we talked about how

277
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,980
bucket domain names follow a very

278
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,740
well-known pattern if you hook this

279
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,020
stream you can detect new buckets either

280
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,780
as they're being created or when the

281
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,420
when the bucket is having its its TLS

282
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,550
certificate renewed and finally it's a

283
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,410
it's just a simple JSON web screen web

284
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,510
stream it couldn't be easier to consume

285
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,480
and from their website it looks like

286
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,810
this so it just flows flow certificate

287
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,160
data in

288
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,170
now the other place you can find buckets

289
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,370
is through your own DNS server logs if

290
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,920
you have the luxury of running your own

291
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,560
DNS relay you would be surprised at how

292
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,510
many websites just pull data in from

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,030
their own buckets just from the web

294
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,030
browser so if you run your own DNS relay

295
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,970
you can check some boxes and and get

296
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,199
those logs you can you can mine that for

297
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,810
new buckets that you may not have known

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,030
about so where's this merciless

299
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,550
automation that I talked about so I

300
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,990
wrote a tool it's called crawl it is a

301
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,300
Windows service this is a Windows

302
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,190
centric talk sorry guys it crawls

303
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,439
pastebin and github for everything that

304
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,940
we've talked about it divides workflows

305
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,370
into different threads on different

306
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,190
processors so that you can divide up the

307
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,440
workflow and really scale up and scale

308
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,970
out as necessary and it is backed by

309
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,340
sequel server for data storage and

310
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,200
coordination among many many data

311
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,460
processors or you can run it on one

312
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,070
system and just have everything

313
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,930
self-contained so it saves post from

314
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,700
pastebin and commits from github when

315
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,319
they contain keywords of interest now

316
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,810
the key word thing is pretty useful

317
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,210
because as you find more interesting

318
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,650
keywords you know as time goes on let's

319
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,680
say I see a tweet like this and I think

320
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,360
oh yeah this Facebook app ID kind of key

321
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,699
word there that's pretty useful I'm

322
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,170
gonna add it to my list you can just

323
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,810
throw things in there and it's gonna go

324
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,630
ahead and and continue to search for new

325
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,579
things so it cues buckets for query

326
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,410
things that are found in Pro Thaksin

327
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,660
insert from search stream and in

328
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,500
real-time and when you submit your dns

329
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,209
server logs

330
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,950
it'll process those and look for buckets

331
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,170
in that and then it'll try and dump the

332
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,660
bucket and look for filenames of

333
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,760
interest so something that's dot pfx I

334
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,240
might find very interesting something

335
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,490
that's dot txt maybe not as much I yeah

336
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,230
and it saves the the origin of this data

337
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,620
so that you can figure out where it came

338
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,620
from later on so it's got a front-end

339
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,940
runs on is of course it lets you go

340
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,820
through the indexing it lets you do

341
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,920
searching and it does presentation you

342
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,940
page through results to find things that

343
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,319
are interesting so the the taking the

344
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,660
wheat from the chaff

345
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,760
you can you can really take this tool

346
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,990
run it overnight and when you come and

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,970
when you wake up in the morning and you

348
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,660
come back to it you're more likely than

349
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,950
not to have

350
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,630
something interesting in front of you

351
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,980
and really all you did was sleep at

352
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,410
night now that said the front end is

353
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,140
more than a little rough you've got a

354
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,329
you've got a keyword search box and a

355
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,130
table tells you where the data is where

356
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,960
the data came from tells you what key

357
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,640
word triggered it to get collected at

358
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,220
the time at which you got it

359
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,890
and as the download thread comes through

360
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,380
it'll update the size after it actually

361
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,590
downloads the the material that that it

362
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,840
found in the search a search stream so

363
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:58,530
you can run this on there single system

364
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,420
the sequel sequel engine the website and

365
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,670
the search services as long as they're

366
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,110
all pointed at each other even if they

367
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,819
are on it even if they're not on a

368
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,370
signal system it'll all just sort of

369
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,530
work itself out so you can have one

370
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,780
system that only does pay spin one or

371
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,730
more systems that do github or buckets

372
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,170
and all that stuff and as long as you

373
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,000
point it all at each other everything

374
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,890
works out just great the only thing that

375
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
you really do have to scale up as you

376
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,880
increase the amount of data that you

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,500
have is your sequel server you can buy

378
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,230
into bigger editions of sequel server

379
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,590
Microsoft makes that really easy so what

380
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,560
results did we find API keys for days so

381
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:38,160
in this example you have a last.fm and a

382
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,020
discord API key so it found these and

383
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,730
naturally like I wanted I wanted to go

384
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,280
look at the repo that had this stuff in

385
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,810
there and and tell they tell the the

386
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,689
code author that he should get that

387
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,209
stuff out but the files were gone when I

388
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,880
went to go look so how did the search

389
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,000
engine actually find it the github

390
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,350
search engine how did it display that

391
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,780
even though the files were deleted and

392
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,150
the reason is git remembers everything

393
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,459
even after you commit a deletion the

394
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,319
data is still in your repo and a lot of

395
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,450
people don't really realize that so you

396
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,400
can still you can still find sensitive

397
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,050
data even after all they did was delete

398
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,900
the files and they didn't roll the creds

399
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,880
or anything like that I wanted to

400
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,340
demonstrate on this one how how quick it

401
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,900
is to find certain things if you notice

402
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,840
the commit time on this was 17 minutes

403
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,990
ago but it found the token for the API

404
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,420
key and or for the API that it was it

405
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,040
was attached to so that's as pretty much

406
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,040
as close to near real time as you can

407
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,139
get and seriously if you want keys to

408
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,610
servus just go looking for it if they're

409
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:45,570
all out there so what else have we found

410
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,339
in paste bin this person put some source

411
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,930
code up there and if you notice it's got

412
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,940
a client ID and a client secret and

413
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,829
that's fine that's all you know well and

414
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,230
good it also has a username and a

415
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:57,989
password this is for a reddit reddit bot

416
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,370
and for whatever reason they just they

417
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,889
put it out on pastebin they didn't

418
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,339
protect it in any way so so that got

419
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,350
found

420
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:09,180
and that got disclosed and no they did

421
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:12,000
not respond now we also have because we

422
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,239
all test in production of course these

423
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,160
people had had a test site many many

424
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,279
test sites and their source code their

425
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,560
test harness had creds to all of the

426
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,560
different test sites now the likelihood

427
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,209
that the test sites were very different

428
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,750
from the production sites from a

429
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:34,829
credential management standpoint is near

430
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,019
zero of course so so I ended up sending

431
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:38,550
them a pull request at the end of the

432
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,620
week I realized I hadn't heard anything

433
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,990
back and thought I'd look through their

434
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,000
other pull requests and realized that

435
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,470
there is a likelihood I'm never going to

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,389
hear from these people ever again if

437
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,620
something labeled soon is three years

438
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:54,000
old and now I mentioned Facebook at the

439
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,130
beginning just because I have some dirty

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,399
knowledge of how that that works this

441
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,010
guy put a facebook access token in a

442
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,730
paste which looks I mean it does look

443
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:08,908
like a lot of random data I it you can't

444
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,890
really visually pull much out but if you

445
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:13,260
know how the facebook access tokens work

446
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,240
you know that it's tied to the identity

447
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,109
of the person or the or the entity that

448
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,819
generated that token so almost certainly

449
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,889
related to this guy now I sent him a

450
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,280
message and to his credit what i legit

451
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,079
think happened is when you don't have

452
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,149
any kind of tie or group membership in

453
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,889
common to a person and you send them a

454
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,929
message you look like a spammer so you

455
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,960
go to this other inbox thing that

456
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:38,640
Facebook has that no one ever checks and

457
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,530
for what reason what they so I think

458
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
that's where it ended up I think this

459
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,090
guy probably never saw anything and

460
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,580
finally you can use paste bin to find

461
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,870
buckets by searching for those domain

462
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,760
names now I mentioned

463
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,520
at the beginning that buckets can be

464
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,940
addressed by domain name directly they

465
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,139
can also be addressed via via it looks

466
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,559
like a directory so if you look here

467
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,260
where it says s3 dot Amazon AWS com

468
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,600
slash yo-yo Zeus yo-yo Zeus is the name

469
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,580
of the bucket so you can find that stuff

470
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,790
and the false positives that I get a lot

471
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,340
are m3u playlists for whatever reason in

472
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,950
pace book pastebin and it's because the

473
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,050
content to which they refer is in an

474
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,840
amazon bucket and so I don't really know

475
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:24,240
why that's why that's happening that way

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,990
in particular but it's something to look

477
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,080
out for so lots of private key material

478
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,679
stop putting private key material on the

479
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Internet

480
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,780
Oh guys there's a lot of it and it's

481
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,399
super easy to find and the other thing

482
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,520
the last thing that I'll talk about that

483
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,059
I found was admin credential network

484
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,710
service now if you have a service like

485
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,600
that and you need to verify users

486
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,330
identities through things like passports

487
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,550
or driver's licenses make a separate

488
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,559
bucket for the sensitive stuff and the

489
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,360
public things you know the social media

490
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,220
type things have that in a different

491
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,020
bucket and make sure you manage your

492
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,570
creds differently for each of them

493
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,000
because the one if it gets dumped who

494
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,939
cares it was social media stuff and the

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,110
other has your address in it so we

496
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,530
really need to watch the way that we're

497
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,590
protecting sensitive information so what

498
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,750
do we do if I'm a developer and my stuff

499
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,689
is out there and it's terrible now for

500
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,130
me so you need to be from the beginning

501
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,830
really you need to be hyper vigilant

502
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,690
about what you put in your in your your

503
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,879
repo when you're developing something in

504
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,730
public it's kind of like learning in

505
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,100
public nobody likes to do it but really

506
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,600
you you need to if you're being visible

507
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,309
about this you need to watch what you're

508
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,879
doing because it actually matters to

509
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:44,280
your users don't put API keys and

510
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,230
cryptographic material in the project

511
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,059
put it in environment variables things

512
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,770
that are going to be specific to the

513
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,440
system on which of code is going to run

514
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:55,770
and as a bonus now you can develop on

515
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,590
tests and differently on prod because

516
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,970
again real developers test on prod and

517
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,720
that's great but we can be fake

518
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,700
developers for once when it actually mad

519
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,370
and don't use paceman as group chat

520
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,800
because even logging messages can

521
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,389
contain sensitive information so you

522
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,520
really need to watch what your what your

523
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,440
just blindly throwing out and shoveling

524
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,250
into paste bin because other people can

525
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,240
find it with nearly no effort so what if

526
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:26,780
it's too late on github this is gonna

527
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,240
suck I mentioned that that git repos

528
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,490
they save everything forever in the

529
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,680
entire repository there's no way to

530
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,230
really easily get that stuff out there's

531
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,750
no one-click there's a lot of get black

532
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,820
magic that you're gonna have to do it's

533
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,850
gonna take a while especially if your

534
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,189
project is very complicated ideally what

535
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,740
you do is download your entire repo and

536
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,590
all of its branches nuke that thing from

537
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,040
orbit and fix it locally and then commit

538
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,290
it back up that's your easiest scenario

539
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,450
now this guy Steven Auster Miller I

540
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,990
don't know much about him but he had

541
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,090
easily the most accessible tutorial

542
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,330
about oh my god I've committed something

543
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,209
to get how do I get it out I would

544
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:13,429
recommend that that particular

545
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,240
walkthrough for how to how to unscrew

546
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,260
yourself really

547
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:22,190
now buckets bucketz the story is uh it's

548
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:24,200
a lot better for everybody you don't

549
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,770
have to do anything when you create your

550
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,170
bucket to make it secure there is a a

551
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,389
three section screen the first section

552
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,510
says do not grant public read access to

553
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,670
this bucket just don't do it the setting

554
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,530
on the same screen says do not grant

555
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,840
public read access to this bucket and

556
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,210
says recommended very helpful and right

557
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,129
under that it says we highly recommend

558
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,320
you don't grant public read access to

559
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,250
this bucket don't do it just don't do it

560
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,050
it's very easy now the one thing that I

561
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,260
think Amazon did a disservice to

562
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,139
developers for if any of you are Windows

563
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,760
admins you know the role of

564
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,280
authenticated users that's anybody in

565
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,350
your enterprise who can authenticate to

566
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,290
the domain it's not somebody in someone

567
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,969
else's enterprise they're your users so

568
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,409
you give them privileges you know the

569
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,830
least amount of privileges that they

570
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:20,480
need to do their job in AWS uh

571
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:23,779
kated users is anybody in AWS it's not

572
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,450
anybody in your enterprise in AWS it's

573
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,210
anybody on AWS and mm-hmm and you can

574
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,029
create AWS tokens for free that means

575
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,760
it's the same as public read access

576
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:37,159
functionally so again I think this is

577
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,169
what Amazon did as a disservice to its

578
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,909
own developers yes they call it out but

579
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,940
only in the Help section they don't make

580
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:45,080
it super obvious in red flashing letters

581
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,149
so really if your permissions are

582
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,340
already screwed you can as long as the

583
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:50,870
horse is not already out of the barn you

584
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,209
can change your permissions and it's

585
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,370
very easy but again don't do

586
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,669
authenticated read it is functionally

587
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,709
the same as public read access now again

588
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:04,639
I talked about separation of privilege

589
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,289
in terms of what you want to have for

590
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:08,570
sensitive information in some buckets

591
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,340
and public information in others I know

592
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,678
it's hard I know it's difficult and it

593
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,120
requires thought and process but really

594
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,240
you can do it let's all do the right

595
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,559
thing because I believe in you and

596
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,630
finally what would I do next for this

597
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,639
tool I mentioned that there are several

598
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:27,019
ways in which you can dump and address

599
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:28,760
buckets the the first one is the is the

600
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,950
fully qualified domain name but there

601
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,049
are several of those this one only

602
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,080
assumes that buckets are accessible in

603
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,990
the US East region I would expand that

604
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,480
to say all of all the rest of the AWS

605
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,120
regions of which there are many now on

606
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,389
the backend this thing can already store

607
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,908
and delineate between s3 Azure and

608
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:51,469
digitalocean storage but the crawlers

609
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:53,330
for Azure and digital ocean storage

610
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,480
aren't implemented so I would implement

611
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,370
those and finally a front-end that

612
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,309
doesn't look like doesn't look like

613
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,018
trash I'm gonna I'm gonna start the list

614
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:05,629
of front-end devs that are better than

615
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,409
me that's drunk toddlers and the file

616
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,960
types

617
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,669
I would also increase so that right now

618
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,159
what it does if you click a file is

619
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,200
it'll display it as plain text but if

620
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,840
for example you clicked a dot Sur file

621
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,460
dot CER it would interpret the

622
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
certificate information and kind of show

623
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,460
you things like the common name the

624
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,949
issuer and things like that I would do

625
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:29,149
that for several commonly used but

626
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,710
commonly used file types that should not

627
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:32,139
be on the inner

628
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,120
in the first place I would also continue

629
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,799
with integrations I would add things

630
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,289
like truffle hog and get all secrets

631
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,658
again this is a Windows tool but with

632
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,860
Windows subsystem for Linux integration

633
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,600
with stuff like that is getting a lot

634
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,629
easier and so I would do that

635
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,870
I'd also scan for entropy right now if I

636
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:52,090
were to if I were to say put raw

637
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,090
certificate data in a file called my

638
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,580
data txt this tool would not find it but

639
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,889
if I then scan that file for entropy and

640
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,510
notice that it's you know 99% random

641
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,429
yeah that's probably cryptic

642
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,890
cryptographic data I would get that file

643
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,679
and finally once it goes on the Internet

644
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,140
which is probably in the next hour to

645
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,620
pull requests are open yep new features

646
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,659
are welcome so I want to thank per toxin

647
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,879
and the search stream guys for making a

648
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,010
lot of the bucket detection possible up

649
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,010
garden prom tech for calling attention

650
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:26,529
to this issue and Steven Oscar Miller

651
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:29,649
for his really awesome how to get stuff

652
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:33,429
off github walkthrough and finally I'll

653
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:36,789
take questions if there are any I know
