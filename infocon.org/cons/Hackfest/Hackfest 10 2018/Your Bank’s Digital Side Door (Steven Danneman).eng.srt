[Applause]

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:10,380
good afternoon very excited to be here

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,580
it's my first hackfest actually and then

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,320
my first time on stage that hackfest so

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,850
love giving back to the community and

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
talk about some research that I've done

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,439
for the past nine months I have to thank

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,939
my employer quickly everyone's got those

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,650
disclaimers my employer does not

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,119
sanction not my employer gave me the

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,269
time and money to do this so I have to

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,579
talk about them on every slide so

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:40,230
hacking banks because that's where the

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:44,340
money is my interest I don't write banks

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,430
software I am just a sort of finance

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,390
geek in addition to being a tech and

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,640
security geek and I had curl python and

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,440
a little bit of curiosity and went from

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,030
knowing nothing about this topic about

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,820
nine months ago to telling you

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:07,350
everything I know today and it started

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,930
with me bounce in my checkbook trying to

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:16,158
handle my own finances using quicken

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:20,610
I've got I've got a lot of bank accounts

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,200
some people collect baseball cards so

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,000
ever you probably have too many domain

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,140
names I have too many credit cards and

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,860
and I need a way to keep track of them

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,979
all so I use I use Quicken I don't want

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,860
to do it myself I use some software sort

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,990
of purpose-built for that and I am

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,670
security aware so I have two factor

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,839
authentication on all my accounts of

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,399
course as all of you do and I put in one

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,470
of my new accounts and the two-factor

36
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,770
doesn't work or it doesn't let me access

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,210
my account through this desktop software

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,649
well I think surely if I drop the

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,419
two-factor that's not gonna work

40
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:03,090
nope that works so I got to put in my to

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,750
faxer on my mobile banking app I got to

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,628
put my two-factor on my web banking app

43
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,120
why not here what's going on is there

44
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,170
some different protocol going on is

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,690
there some different way

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,970
this desktop app is talking to my bank

47
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:24,600
fire up wireshark

48
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:27,900
and and begin so Quicken is what the

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,230
financial industry calls a pfm personal

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,600
financial manager there's these are some

51
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,549
of the big names personal capital a lot

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,769
of people use mint.com a lot of my

53
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,380
friends use mint.com to you know keep

54
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:46,260
track of their finances and and do

55
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:48,359
budgeting quickens the devil I know I

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,079
it's it's the product that I've been

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,200
using for 12 years I I hate it it's

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,390
terrible I don't recommend it I love to

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
hate it I sort of swear I find a bug

60
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,570
every single time I use it and I keep

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,470
paying them $100 a year because I'm a

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,700
masochist

63
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:12,570
so I wish there was something better

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,060
here I could recommend to you but as

65
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,489
we'll see a sort of whole ecosystem here

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,370
I think is a bit broken and and need

67
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:24,810
some radical change so if you've never

68
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,100
never seen these products before I'll

69
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,049
just walk you through real quick from

70
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,709
the end-user perspective what does this

71
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,600
look like you have a desktop app and it

72
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,640
has on the left your list of accounts

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,390
and on the right your list of

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,730
transactions a big spreadsheet telling

75
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,890
you where you spent your money

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,890
you first install this thing you have to

77
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,089
link it with your bank accounts so it

78
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,000
gives you a whole list of different

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,480
financial products we use you click on

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,320
one of them gives you a list of banks to

81
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,429
search for you find yours ask you how

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,400
you want to connect we'll get into that

83
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,650
gives you this box to enter your plain

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,160
text username and password on a site

85
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:16,500
that is obviously not your banks somehow

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,978
finds your accounts asks you which ones

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,959
you want to track and then starts

88
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:25,890
downloading your transactions that's

89
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,930
what the end user sees using this pfm

90
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,979
software

91
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,920
there's three different ways to connect

92
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,020
the this these are sort of quickens

93
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,580
terms quicken and Intuit they're kind of

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,190
the the industry leader here even though

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,550
there's there's other products web

96
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,370
Connect is a fancy way of saying go to

97
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,780
the website and download a file and then

98
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:51,450
manually import it into the desktop app

99
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,719
Express web connect is a bot that does

100
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,969
that for you and Direct Connect or the

101
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,700
ofx protocol which we're going to dive

102
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,760
into is an actual bi-directional

103
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,140
programmatic structured query sort of

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:11,580
proto web service that you can use to

105
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:15,510
talk directly to your bank once again in

106
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:20,370
picture form web connect the middleman

107
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:22,680
is you express web connect you talk to a

108
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,820
intuit server and then it has a bot that

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,520
scrapes your bank's website for you and

110
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,110
Direct Connect is an actual direct

111
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,109
connection between you and your bank

112
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:40,260
financial institution here is another

113
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,130
term you guys pull you in on that's

114
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:49,550
that's the sort of general name for

115
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:52,290
Investment Banking checking credit card

116
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,180
instead of instead of just bank the

117
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,040
general term is financial institution so

118
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll start saying fi or financial

119
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,610
institution from now on now that you're

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,070
in with a banking lingo with me I'll

121
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,110
still say bank two sort of generally cuz

122
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,210
that's easy as well when they say bank I

123
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:14,280
don't necessarily specifically mean bank

124
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,200
I might mean like investments other

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,179
important players here are these account

126
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,800
aggregation companies these are billion

127
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,680
dollar companies Yodlee has been around

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,450
for 20 years they figured out early that

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,010
this sort of ecosystem was insane that

130
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,409
dealing with thousands of financial

131
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,810
institutions trying to get data in a

132
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,790
programmatic way that they they could be

133
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,730
a middleman for that and and provide a

134
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,030
helpful service

135
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:49,080
they basically provide a single API for

136
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,469
client developers and then then do all

137
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,969
that bot screen scraping maintenance

138
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,240
behind the scenes so their their screen

139
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:00,030
scrapers as a service but they provide a

140
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,580
nice API for client developers and then

141
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,859
they also clean and normalize the data

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,880
from all these disparate data sources so

143
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,290
that you know buying something at

144
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,510
McDonald's on your credit card on one

145
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,280
bank and buying McDonald's your credit

146
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,900
card on another bank they look the same

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,630
when they get to your to your software

148
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,659
the banks hate these companies we have

149
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,290
bankers we have some bankers here they

150
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,400
hate them because they look like BOTS

151
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,320
they're doing legitimate work but they

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,419
look like BOTS and there's plenty of bad

153
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,340
BOTS attacking the bank's constantly and

154
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,170
so it's hard to tell the difference

155
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:45,960
between the good BOTS and the and the

156
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:49,470
bad BOTS so in picture form again now

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,400
you have your creds going to some web

158
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:57,090
app which sends them to some web service

159
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:02,849
which sends them to your bank all plain

160
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:05,640
text and you have to believe that each

161
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,640
of these hops has your own financial

162
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,830
best interest at heart and that they are

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,140
competent enough to protect a secret I

164
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:19,409
am not sure which one is easier to

165
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:24,750
believe I I think the latter is more

166
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:26,940
difficult so if you haven't seen it

167
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,800
already let's spell it out the first big

168
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,370
problem in this whole space of your

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,130
money is a shocking lack of least

170
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,679
privilege one of the simplest secure

171
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,409
development principles we have you have

172
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,140
one set of credentials which provide

173
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,339
full read/write access to every account

174
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,260
at your bank and all of your money you

175
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,600
share these credentials with a number of

176
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,209
whiz-bang financial startups and

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,110
middlemen in plain

178
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,300
next you give them that password that

179
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:06,899
password pretty much lives forever

180
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:08,189
there's not even expiration and what's

181
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,619
needed here what we'd do if you're

182
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:14,009
designing this today is use something

183
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:16,980
like ooofff a tokenized application

184
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,889
based access control system where you

185
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,410
the end user gets to grant specific more

186
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:25,069
granular privileges on a time restricted

187
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,379
basis to each of those organizations

188
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:33,209
that's that's what we need and we do not

189
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:35,309
have it so that's the intro let's get

190
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,920
technical I want to dive in we'll look

191
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:41,579
at look at some actual packets on the

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,969
wire I'm going to sort of go through

193
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:47,339
specification what is possible then

194
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,529
we'll dive into implementation and

195
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:55,230
deployment what this looks like in the

196
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:59,759
in the real world testing banks so

197
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,649
Direct Connect or the ufx protocol is is

198
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,410
a public specification and has been from

199
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,449
the beginning there's there's a website

200
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,399
you can download this for free you can

201
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,319
implement it for free you can grab it on

202
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,920
your smart phone right now and and read

203
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:20,219
along it's 650 pages it's it's quite

204
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:22,529
complex nfsv4 RFC is about 650 pages if

205
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,429
you've if you've worked on that it's it

206
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,350
can do a lot of things anything you can

207
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:30,869
do with the bank they've put into this

208
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,569
protocol so you're checking your savings

209
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:36,470
account your investments as I mentioned

210
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:38,878
but then also write operations

211
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,410
initiating transfers between two

212
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,569
accounts at the same Bank between

213
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,639
accounts at separate banks between

214
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:50,819
accounts in separate countries the

215
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:53,279
protocol supports these operations it's

216
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,889
up to each financial institution to

217
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,540
decide how much of this they support all

218
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,999
of them support some subset you don't

219
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,889
have to have to support everything the

220
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,889
protocol is quite quite modular

221
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,839
and then in addition to those sort of

222
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,880
obvious things there's a bunch of weird

223
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,490
side things you can do within the

224
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,370
protocol so like changing your password

225
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,860
or registering and rolling to use this

226
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,649
this access you can do all inside of

227
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,920
this ofx there's also these things that

228
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,570
are obviously sort of meant to help

229
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,810
transition a bank from an old

230
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:34,380
paper-based world to a fully electronic

231
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:37,529
world like you can download a jpeg of

232
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,670
your printed bank statement through the

233
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:44,189
protocol or you can have bills from

234
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,689
third parties sent to you again as like

235
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,160
PDFs through the protocol also messaging

236
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,709
you canyou can pass messages back and

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,380
forth just like when Facebook added

238
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:58,199
their own messaging inside ofx protocol

239
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,180
I did their own email inside of the

240
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,190
protocol so that a private channel

241
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:07,380
between you and your bank on the wire I

242
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,430
said it's a proto web service because it

243
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,640
was first invented in 1997 before rest

244
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:18,390
existed before JSON existed they they

245
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:22,350
were tunnelling over HTTP and a request

246
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:24,470
response very web service way but but

247
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:29,459
without all the standards and sort of

248
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:33,660
guidelines we understand in 2018 so here

249
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:37,680
is a real request and response the only

250
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,319
part of the HTTP requests that's

251
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,150
interesting is there is its own content

252
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:49,470
type application X o FX n o FX server is

253
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:54,390
usually defined by a specific path on

254
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:57,570
the URL you know remember CGI that's the

255
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:00,959
that's what this is and then the user

256
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,180
agent some servers restricts the user

257
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,649
agent so here I'm using the the intuit

258
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,250
user agent the same thing that that

259
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,250
quicken claims

260
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,760
I've gotten rid of the HTTP headers same

261
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,730
packet we're just going to zoom in to

262
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,089
look at what ofx is it has this header

263
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,940
portion that's that's after the HTTP

264
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,520
header it's mostly static so we don't

265
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,320
worry about it too much but it's where

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,520
you specify the version number from both

267
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,120
client and server and then here on the

268
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,550
left and the request is a user ID and

269
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,850
password sending the plain text password

270
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:53,459
every time like HTTP basic auth the

271
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,330
finance the FI sometimes you have to

272
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,829
specify what your bank ID is in your

273
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,149
bank organization sometimes you don't

274
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:07,589
and then you get back a success message

275
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:12,870
and and then some some data in this sort

276
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:17,550
of XML ish format this is actually sgml

277
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,779
which came after HTML when we knew we

278
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,899
needed to something a little more

279
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:26,189
structured but before XML before we got

280
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:28,170
very rigid on on parsing so that you

281
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,380
couldn't put in weird input you can tell

282
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,990
it's sgml because you're span elements

283
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,000
don't have closing tags that's kind of

284
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,860
the tell-tale sign you get block level

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,230
elements which do have opening closing

286
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:49,700
tags and span elements which don't so

287
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,170
again on the wire typical conversation

288
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,240
first thing a client ever sends is

289
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,219
what's called a profile request you can

290
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,720
do that with anonymous credentials and

291
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,130
you get back a bunch of information from

292
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,079
the server this is where they're

293
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,649
negotiating what capabilities do you

294
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,599
support what do I support then as we saw

295
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,399
with the client you'll send your real

296
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,829
username and password with an account

297
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,430
info request get back a list of accounts

298
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:16,529
and then send a statement request with

299
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,300
your account and get back your your list

300
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,480
of transactions it's it's pretty easy to

301
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,479
follow

302
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:36,059
here's that first profile request you

303
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:39,240
can see it's a prof RQ coming back is a

304
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:41,639
bank message set which sort of implies I

305
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,249
support banking I can give you checking

306
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,009
account information I can give you

307
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:49,769
savings account information and a expert

308
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,360
prof which means I support transfers you

309
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,360
can transfer money internally between

310
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,040
between accounts so this profile

311
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,740
requests just the existence of these

312
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:06,059
elements implies the capabilities that

313
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:07,649
that server supports in addition to the

314
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,920
capabilities you get some interesting

315
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:16,350
info in this profile response you get

316
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:19,110
this information on the address on phone

317
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,819
number this is 1997 when this is first

318
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,910
thought out a lot of banks don't have

319
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:25,920
websites it was sort of thought that

320
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,469
this protocol and your desktop thick

321
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,599
client might be your only access to the

322
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,009
bank so you have to you get contact

323
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,009
information this way

324
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:49,579
1997 102 starts this whole endeavor was

325
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:53,550
was a joint joint projects between

326
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,560
Microsoft's into it who made quicken in

327
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,740
QuickBooks and a company called check

328
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,030
free Microsoft Intuit had clients they

329
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,970
had a vested interest in selling those

330
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,680
clients check free had servers assumedly

331
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,329
getting banks to implement even one of

332
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,490
their proprietary protocols was hard

333
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,189
enough so they joined forces to make

334
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,720
this single open protocol that everybody

335
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,140
would speak which is which is great it

336
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,720
was a great idea at the time

337
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,680
2006 comes along the US federal

338
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,480
government same branch with the FDIC

339
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,800
says hey we have customer information

340
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,690
online we should or you banking

341
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,030
organizations should support

342
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:37,470
multi-factor authentication not a must

343
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:41,730
in RFC terms but a strong should so the

344
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:43,800
protocol got revved 103 and and 203

345
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:51,350
which is same functionality but in XML

346
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:55,320
and added MFA which we'll get into 2017

347
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:59,550
comes and the protocol still actively

348
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,280
developed ooofff gets introduced 2.2 new

349
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:06,030
things this is this is good good news

350
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,300
just just 9 months ago November 2017 was

351
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:13,350
that was the latest Rev there's a big

352
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,610
gap here 11 years right 2006 2017 what

353
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,469
happened

354
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:23,219
Microsoft stopped stopped selling

355
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,050
Microsoft money there their client app I

356
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,060
don't know why maybe it wasn't

357
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,310
profitable enough 2009 they stopped

358
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,409
selling it into it's the only game in

359
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,200
town QuickBooks quickens doing a game in

360
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,850
town and they just stopped caring they

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,920
just stopped innovating they start

362
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,199
charging their annual fee and nothing

363
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,500
changes I haven't done a binary diff

364
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,420
between like quicken 2011 and 2012 but I

365
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,590
bet it's it's like it fits on a single

366
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,760
page what what changed so it's

367
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,669
unfortunate competition of course

368
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,620
in the loss of competition we we lose

369
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,060
the incentive to innovate but what did

370
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,540
happen good news is there's this whole

371
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,110
homebrew community people love Microsoft

372
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,840
money

373
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,889
there was like forum posts like like

374
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,449
poetry about goodbye Microsoft money and

375
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:15,080
geeks they started writing their little

376
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,420
Python scripts and started like like

377
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,040
binary hacking Microsoft money so would

378
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,620
talk to other servers and this whole

379
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,420
little community built up which started

380
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,100
sort of learning about you affects

381
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,280
protocol and that's what I built my

382
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,199
stuff on was was this existing sort of

383
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,110
finance geek community who just who

384
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:39,110
still wanted to get their their banking

385
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:41,659
transactions into an app they loved mfa

386
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,580
multi-factor authentication quick review

387
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,420
you guys all know this something you

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,629
know something you have or something you

389
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,690
are choose choose two factors and then

390
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,030
and then you're you're more secure

391
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,890
against brute-force attacks or loss of

392
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,260
password you know the script Katie

393
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,580
oversees can conceal your password or

394
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,430
get it from password dump but that

395
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:08,840
second factor gets rid of these account

396
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:12,230
takeover attacks very effective security

397
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,080
community has mostly agreed upon 2-step

398
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,030
authentication as the name of this sort

399
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,699
of one-and-a-half factor it's not

400
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,290
strictly something separate but it's an

401
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,180
out-of-band channel of separate

402
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,550
information this is you're very familiar

403
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,600
with this Twitter still uses SMS a

404
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,460
message a time-based code of r sm s so

405
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,040
2-step authentication this is what the

406
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,980
banks are using in general on web apps

407
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,930
and on mobile apps not to two-factor to

408
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:43,400
step but but better than than one factor

409
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,860
so what's in the protocol specification

410
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,830
for multi-factor authentication for

411
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,490
different implementations actually the

412
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,350
first two are security questions or user

413
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,870
cred sort of a free-form field the bank

414
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:01,030
can ask you a question you respond and

415
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:07,719
if a challenge is a hard-coded list of

416
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,720
questions inside the spec here they are

417
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,320
mostly things that we realize in 2018

418
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,030
aren't really private information not to

419
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,550
mention that if you know every question

420
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,260
you have to ask it's a lot easier to

421
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:27,840
steal that and and spoof a second factor

422
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:30,870
your zip code favorite color well the

423
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,389
other two more promising again this is

424
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,790
we're talking about the specification

425
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,370
what can happen auth token is this

426
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:41,760
server generated static string it sends

427
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,959
it to the client the client has to it's

428
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,470
supposed to send it out of and the

429
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,270
client has to provide it that's like the

430
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,400
two-step authentication no one uses this

431
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,850
I haven't seen it in the wild anywhere

432
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,820
it could be used with SMS codes but but

433
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:00,120
they don't what what banks are using is

434
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,090
the client you ID client UID is the

435
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,010
client generate some gooood trust on

436
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,959
first use I'll send this to you the very

437
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,290
first time I connect Bank server

438
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,230
remembers that gooood and then

439
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,180
forevermore if I connect to you I have

440
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,790
to provide that same good or you or you

441
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,340
deny me that's the the second factor

442
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:25,110
also something you know also something

443
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,270
you made up unfortunately people have

444
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,820
multiple machines like a desktop and a

445
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,420
laptop and a phone protocol realizes

446
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,399
this you might install your software in

447
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,530
two places so it's not trust on first

448
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,220
use it's trust unlike your first four

449
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,750
uses so you know the first time I send

450
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,250
you an ID that's okay and then like the

451
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,460
second time that's okay too and the

452
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,910
third time that an N will stop you so

453
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,070
it's not that useful when an attacker

454
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,440
already has your password and can just

455
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:58,950
make up what the second factor is well

456
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,590
there's good news because these are all

457
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:06,530
in 103 that protocol Rev from 2006 and

458
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:10,919
80% of banks in the wild or running 102

459
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:14,550
so we don't have to worry we don't have

460
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,950
to worry about about this very poor

461
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,950
implementation cuz it doesn't it's not

462
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,280
even there 20% sour green number about

463
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,980
20

464
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Senate banks at lease are on the 2006

465
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:32,040
version of the protocol that 0% that's

466
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,350
2.2 the one with the one was ooofff yeah

467
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,270
no one it's only been out nine months

468
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:40,830
but no one is no one is using a lot if I

469
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,490
lost some of you and the technical weeds

470
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:47,550
too long didn't read someone steals your

471
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,900
password they don't need your MFA token

472
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:57,060
if they just switch this different

473
00:23:48,900 --> 00:24:00,330
protocol I use a different client so who

474
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:05,010
are these financial institutions running

475
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:08,870
these 21 year old software you may have

476
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:13,379
heard of these guys the big five

477
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:15,000
actually I'll let the Scotiabank is not

478
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,100
on here I couldn't find a no effect

479
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,920
server but the the other the other four

480
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,429
had them

481
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,430
Canada's got 30 domestic banks about 60

482
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,340
foreign subsidiaries or branches and

483
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,800
about 700 credit unions

484
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,169
not all of them surely are running Oh

485
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,649
effects but a lot of them a lot of them

486
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,410
are and all the big us names too of

487
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,390
course you know from Citibank Capital

488
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,980
One Bank of America

489
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:51,720
all the way to Yolo you only live once

490
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:54,500
Federal Credit Union this is me

491
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,210
participating in Bank branch tourism I

492
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,480
specifically flew here to get this photo

493
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:08,100
it's in California in rural California I

494
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:09,570
have a lot of bank accounts and if

495
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,080
there's any enterprising individuals in

496
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,210
here are you ready to start a bank Jack

497
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,470
Henry can help they sell this financial

498
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,170
software they'd love for there to be

499
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,580
more banks I know there's a couple CTS

500
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,870
tonight but if anyone wants just get in

501
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,080
a corner and hack together a bank I'm

502
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,080
game

503
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,190
how many banks are there North America

504
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,439
US and Canada mainly I didn't actually

505
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,720
find any any banks in Mexico that are

506
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
using this protocol it depends on who

507
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,230
you ask

508
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,930
into it likes to say there's 15,000

509
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,060
financial institutions although that

510
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:48,400
that includes sort of every branded

511
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,340
product so like the the Tim Hortons

512
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,380
credit card from CIBC is considered a

513
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,980
sound financial institution for their

514
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,330
metrics

515
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,110
there's about 7,000 commercial banks

516
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:04,240
actually I think that's a u.s. number

517
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:06,010
only so about 8,000 US and in Canada the

518
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,630
effects can show some the guys who put

519
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,970
together the spec they claimed there was

520
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,280
at least at one time 7,000 people

521
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,640
running this protocol I was able to find

522
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,740
about 2,000 on the public internet and

523
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,440
those sort of compressed down to about

524
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,280
400 actual servers because there's a lot

525
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,410
of service providers in play a lot of

526
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,970
effects software-as-a-service a hundred

527
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:33,520
different banks all pointed the same

528
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,390
server and and then tenet eyes so let's

529
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,100
get into it let's get into that

530
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,070
investigation what did I what did I find

531
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,909
I spent sort of a lot of time surveying

532
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,620
the Internet

533
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:46,120
two simple questions what financial

534
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,879
institutions are running these servers

535
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,979
that I know are old and what software is

536
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,130
providing the service could have made

537
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:59,050
some phone calls but I sent get requests

538
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:02,110
instead this is the important part to

539
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:04,629
bring up the disclaimer it's hard to get

540
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,090
this software these are I didn't have a

541
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,790
lab these are live production servers at

542
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,340
fortune 500 companies I did not want to

543
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:16,060
even accidentally take one offline or a

544
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:19,750
gain unauthorized access so this was

545
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:25,330
very high level recon which should not

546
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,900
have failed as hard as it did what do we

547
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,030
do first

548
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,940
a numerate host what do I find these

549
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:34,080
guys that's what a affects typical

550
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,730
affects URL looks like that community of

551
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,010
hobbyists was a fantastic start there's

552
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,750
some people who keep databases so that

553
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,180
their scripts can talk to them

554
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,340
affects home comm is the great place to

555
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:48,250
go to find if your bank has one of these

556
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,659
also some various wikis and then the

557
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,010
commercial products quicken they keep

558
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,400
their own database they call it the

559
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,320
branding service it's basically DNS for

560
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,270
banks put in a name get back a get back

561
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,360
a URL so you can you can talk to a door

562
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,129
or you know listen in on on

563
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
communication when you're talking to

564
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,650
your bank through the commercial

565
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,270
products so I've got a list ahead of I

566
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,740
don't remember the my final number it's

567
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,350
and it's in the thousands it's much more

568
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,430
than the actual number of live hosts and

569
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,050
I wanted to ask

570
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,810
so who's who's still alive this is an

571
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,490
archaeological OG adventure you know

572
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,620
some of these lists are from 2011

573
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,320
obviously things change on the server

574
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:31,989
side so let's just do a TLS ping I'm

575
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:36,100
just gonna make a TLS connection 232

576
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,930
stale DNS records the o FX dot Bank

577
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,600
still exists but there's no server

578
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,050
listening not an exploit but okie you

579
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,820
should have cleaned up your DNS starting

580
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:51,149
you know a little sign of not not you

581
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:54,040
know super tight IT infrastructure 15

582
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:57,880
house still listing live with expired

583
00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:00,010
certs presumably still with your

584
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,410
customer data on them and definitely

585
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,270
without anyone checking whether they're

586
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:09,190
alive or dead big red flag here that

587
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:13,870
these are on monitored and we can we

588
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:16,510
could dive in further after I see who's

589
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:20,110
alive these are all web services let's

590
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:25,410
just do web recon 101 let's send a get

591
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,409
request and like an empty post request

592
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:32,110
server banners okay it's telling me it's

593
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,139
running is you know should should

594
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,770
configure that more secure not a not a

595
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,030
big deal

596
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:43,750
Oh FX service banner is this is nice

597
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,970
okay so this is the effects service

598
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:49,300
I got a version number I get an exact

599
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,690
build number I get a date and time it

600
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,690
was built

601
00:29:52,930 --> 00:30:00,220
more the same build date on the NSA NSA

602
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:09,940
P I plugin anybody notice anything

603
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:11,950
interesting about that date 2007 alright

604
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,300
we did our webserver profiling let's

605
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,360
look at the effect server let's start

606
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,899
talking the real the real protocol

607
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,790
what's the simplest thing I can I can

608
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:27,310
send I want to send a small minimal ofx

609
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,889
payload looks like that we'll just the

610
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:34,570
base tag with nothing inside let's send

611
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:39,670
that Java laying the whole pointer

612
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:42,189
exception okay again not this is not a

613
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,500
zero day but you not you don't handle

614
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:50,140
the simple case parsing where were your

615
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:54,310
test cases we're gonna three four here

616
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:56,200
sending that same payload I it starts to

617
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,000
write the header to the socket but then

618
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,790
stops writing the header to the socket

619
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,140
and then starts writing the body and

620
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,060
there's two spaces in the error message

621
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,820
showing me it's just gonna reflect back

622
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:09,760
whatever I put in that F ID field I I

623
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:12,040
left its blank here and sequel state oh

624
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,700
two zero zero quick Google tells you

625
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,500
that's IBM db2 database back-end the

626
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,910
database error goes straight to whatever

627
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,470
middleware go straight to the

628
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:26,860
application server and is passed right

629
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:32,350
onto the client you can laugh yeah

630
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:37,629
that's that's oh this is what I was

631
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:43,480
looking for stack traces stack traces

632
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:47,620
with full path two lines of code on the

633
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:55,300
local file system from an empty post

634
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:57,310
request ticklin error messages somewhat

635
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,169
accidently let's try to get real info

636
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,179
let's send very valid requests and this

637
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:04,930
profile I can send it anonymously let's

638
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,020
just see what real data I get back

639
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,740
that's the

640
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,740
supposed to be there

641
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,070
long live session key there are some

642
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,660
session keys and not they're not

643
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,980
frequently used that it f initely

644
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,350
shouldn't be used when I'm logging in

645
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:25,220
with anonymous but this server gave me a

646
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:27,560
year long session key the profile

647
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,790
response is nice enough to tell you what

648
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,260
the password policy is because you can

649
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,330
change your password through the

650
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,150
protocol so you know the client want

651
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,949
might want to enforce it client-side so

652
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,010
this this server has a password policy

653
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:47,870
minimum length for the maximum length

654
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:52,070
for case sensitive no special characters

655
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:54,050
no spaces no I'll do the math for you

656
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,810
about a million and a half combinations

657
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:59,180
you do ten a second over a even slow

658
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,669
connection two days to brute-force the

659
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,230
whole key space half a day because

660
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:07,670
you'll get lucky and find it before that

661
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:16,000
or one day one day cut it in half I hear

662
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:18,650
some sighs last lasts recon I sent is a

663
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,450
enumerate the account I have no real

664
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,410
usernames and passwords I'm gonna send

665
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:26,450
the anonymous user

666
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:28,130
I'm expecting a access denied or a no

667
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,050
accounts found not even telling me

668
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,020
access tonight too obvious error

669
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:37,300
messages that should be implemented and

670
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:40,250
only to request looks like this

671
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,919
anonymous user ID and password and the

672
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:49,660
account info block to say give me in my

673
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:52,340
list of accounts and the response is or

674
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:56,390
responses I didn't get any account lists

675
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:59,689
thank goodness but I did get a whole lot

676
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,700
of error messages sign-on invalid could

677
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:05,030
not process request invalid session

678
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,000
general error this is the exact same

679
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:10,730
very small request to two thousand

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,340
different servers why are there 40-plus

681
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:17,540
different error messages how many

682
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:19,600
implementations are out there how many

683
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,920
different configurations

684
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,339
some of these are you know are obviously

685
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,080
leaking through from the back end so

686
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,580
let's go into that the financial

687
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,409
software vendors who are providing these

688
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:35,630
these services quick overview on how

689
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,750
banks do software from a very high level

690
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:41,090
on the Left you have your core

691
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,980
this is often a mainframe this is your

692
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,020
database essentially and your batch

693
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,850
processing figures out how much money

694
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,460
are in all accounts in the bank at the

695
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:52,370
end of the day in the middle you have

696
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,100
your middleware every bank service that

697
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:57,069
you're sort of used to as a customer

698
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,390
dealing with an ATM doing bill pay

699
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,400
getting your your statement sent to you

700
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,810
and then the front end just the UI the

701
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:10,760
web mobile and a no effects API every

702
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:13,190
single square in this graph can and

703
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,010
often is implemented by a separate

704
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:20,720
software vendor and then has to talk to

705
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:24,440
all the other squares you can see the

706
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:28,600
complexity it's it's very high not only

707
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,730
that but very often these are not

708
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,960
individual deployments these are custom

709
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:38,330
builds per Bank Bank a and Bank B buys

710
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,740
from the same vendor and they have

711
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:45,819
different code running per per financial

712
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,100
institution great for vendor lock-in

713
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:53,060
but terrible for maintenance for

714
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:58,460
software abstraction for for testing

715
00:35:53,060 --> 00:36:01,730
because the complexity where do I buy

716
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:06,170
this software there's no shrink-wrapped

717
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,640
boxes or apps get or app store these are

718
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,980
you go to any of these financial

719
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,020
institution websites and it's like we

720
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,920
offer the best solution possible here's

721
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,660
a phone number call us high-touch

722
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,230
negotiated in person over multiple month

723
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,779
deals to get a solution to provide you

724
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,640
your banking software some of these ofx

725
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,400
servers don't even have names like

726
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,660
there's not a product name it's just the

727
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,930
solution sold by by a

728
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,839
list of companies right here this is

729
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:41,240
into its official list of who you can

730
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,119
buy a no effect server from if you're a

731
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:48,109
bank and you want to support one there's

732
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,880
25 different entities on here software

733
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:54,770
vendors I found nine more in the wild

734
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,289
presumably no longer preferred partners

735
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,690
for whatever you know back-end sort

736
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:04,670
relationship so we're talking you know

737
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:08,329
30-plus different different vendors some

738
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,890
of the names FIS and Fiserv are the the

739
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:12,349
Microsoft the Google the the

740
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,029
multi-billion dollar companies in this

741
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,700
space

742
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:18,950
Enterprise engineering and q2 they're

743
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,450
smaller sort of upstarts more recent

744
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:25,220
they're just I saw them a lot actually

745
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,140
live on the servers running so they were

746
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:31,129
they were notable names amongst the

747
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:34,160
amongst of 30 their total well I don't

748
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,470
have I have fuzzy data on sort of market

749
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,690
share I got a I got a parse it out a

750
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,270
little bit better some vendors some some

751
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,319
servers I can fingerprint some I can't

752
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:45,380
but this is this is a good

753
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:50,150
representation of probably like 60 to 70

754
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:53,029
percent of the live market now here's

755
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:58,220
Fiserv two months ago getting called out

756
00:37:53,029 --> 00:38:00,710
on Krebs for having a increment the ID

757
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:06,279
by one to see the next accounts

758
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:09,319
transfers error w get is not a crime

759
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:11,630
this was this wasn't a post message I

760
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:17,359
believe not in the URL so it's a little

761
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:20,839
more obscure then there's the hosting

762
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,490
providers these may write their own

763
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,619
software or run software from the other

764
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:28,848
companies you know the Amazon the Azure

765
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:30,529
of the financial world and of course

766
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:32,390
these come up a lot actually a full

767
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:34,660
two-thirds of all the servers that I

768
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,650
found live are at a hosting provider

769
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,029
although that doesn't necessarily mean

770
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,230
they're all the same they can still be

771
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,579
running different software a different

772
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,380
versions of the software but they're

773
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:46,460
hosted in a third party data center

774
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,930
since I'm only in the front end

775
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,260
I didn't get to see a lot of the back

776
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:53,419
end I've talked to a to a fair

777
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,400
number of bankers you know the back end

778
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,130
it might be as simple as like an FTP

779
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,980
batch job to get your financial data on

780
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,570
to these third parties that's why

781
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,440
sometimes you only you can only see

782
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:09,170
stuff from 24 hours before where it

783
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,990
might be VPN straight into their to

784
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:18,530
their their core server headers long

785
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:20,930
tail of different of different stacks a

786
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,810
lot of Microsoft is again about half

787
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:28,910
unknown half telling me exactly what

788
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:30,980
they are and a whole story of

789
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,680
acquisition and atrophy this happens in

790
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,660
tech all the time too but man banks love

791
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,868
to buy each other and being out a

792
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:42,618
divestiture and then do an M&A it's like

793
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,820
compilers and debuggers so if you've

794
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:46,520
been through an acquisition I've been

795
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,589
through - you know sometimes like

796
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,080
products get forgotten you the big

797
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:54,290
company takes over and people leave and

798
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,580
some software just sort of atrophies I I

799
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,880
think that's that's a lot of an

800
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:01,009
explanation here this is just FIS and

801
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,290
for those names up there head first

802
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:09,710
party o FX servers before they were

803
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:12,680
acquired so the vulnerabilities did my

804
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,530
big survey sent some get requests showed

805
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:21,740
you a couple couple of fun ones this is

806
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:23,660
not a PhD level math formula but based

807
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,348
on my experience in software development

808
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:32,270
and pen testing this many technology

809
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:34,930
stacks implementations spec complexity

810
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:39,440
over 21 years it's probably about

811
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:42,109
quarter million bugs everything on the

812
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,720
Left we already talked about I don't

813
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:47,569
have time to get into my bank who still

814
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,480
uses my social security number as my

815
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:56,089
username null values returned

816
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,339
inconsistent input validation cross-site

817
00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:00,080
scripting both reflected and stored I

818
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:07,790
know it's not a website and you

819
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:09,410
I can get XSS so I want to give you guys

820
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:13,580
something so you can play along at home

821
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:15,770
time for the demo I did all this sort of

822
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:18,740
with some hack together Python and in a

823
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,900
database I then took that and put it

824
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,089
into a tool which I'm calling ofx

825
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,190
postern it's up on github you can

826
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,370
download it right now and let me show it

827
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,370
to you

828
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:40,520
so we're doing the tool send to

829
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,410
organization ID and financial ID you can

830
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:47,509
find those in this crowd source database

831
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:49,730
ofx home.com this is recorded but I did

832
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,440
it just a few days ago against CIBC

833
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,090
because I wanted to give you something

834
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,650
local and I thought they're big enough

835
00:41:53,090 --> 00:42:00,410
that they wouldn't mind if we scan them

836
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:03,860
any one from CIBC here come talk to me

837
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,319
afterwards so the tool does everything

838
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:11,150
I've shown you already we're just going

839
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:16,030
to run it it's going to grab do those

840
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:20,090
get requests those very simple anonymous

841
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:21,500
HTTP GET and post requests and then and

842
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,900
then analyze them the same way that I

843
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:28,460
did manually scroll back up at the top

844
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,050
you see just keep a status while we're

845
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:37,070
running it goes it goes pretty quick

846
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:41,390
actually post get profile do some do

847
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:44,720
some fingerprinting and and then run

848
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,310
some sandy tests print out that profile

849
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,810
data from the institution make sure

850
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:54,640
that's the right one you wanted this is

851
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:56,990
actually a the u.s. branch of CIBC

852
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,009
they're the ones that have the main

853
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:04,899
effects server version 102 of course no

854
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:09,380
MFA capabilities printed in a nice

855
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,720
format for you banking transfer between

856
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,510
accounts bill pay messaging lots of

857
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,430
attack surface here

858
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,470
they do say they require clients ID

859
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,930
which is interesting I haven't had a

860
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,339
chance to dive into this because that'd

861
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,899
be like a hybrid protocol they're

862
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,460
claiming they're the old version but

863
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,440
maybe they support version you know part

864
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,450
of the new version which of course you

865
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,130
know there's gonna be like made-up dot

866
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,669
dot versions of the protocol in the wild

867
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:39,520
to not able to figure out via

868
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:43,930
fingerprinting HTTP server but am able

869
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:49,920
to figure out what their software is

870
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:52,720
don't scroll down here quick FIS

871
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,550
Meadowmont a product that's one of the

872
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,959
acquisitions I think 2009 or 2006 they

873
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:03,040
were a big player in the space there's

874
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,230
still a big player but owned subsidiary

875
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,060
now and then we run run the same tests

876
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,260
this this list is growing I'm still

877
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,400
working on this

878
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,440
here we see they got that cross site

879
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,060
scripting problem the post isn't so

880
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,070
isn't so worrisome but the returning

881
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,580
texts HTML has their content type

882
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,290
instead of the ofx content type no MFA

883
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,420
password policy you can have four

884
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:28,150
characters lead well on the other ones I

885
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,980
got the framework I'm adding tests sort

886
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:39,330
of as I as I go as I'm testing new

887
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:43,050
services and pull request welcome so

888
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,049
what do we learn today

889
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:58,180
Oh FX is your bank's digital site door

890
00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:00,540
in front door your web app your client

891
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,220
app spend a decent amount of security

892
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,250
and testing and then analysis on those

893
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,779
ofx gets forgotten it's not a backdoor

894
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:11,020
it's not like an atom and only thing

895
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,720
it's for customers but it's it's just

896
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,580
people aren't paying attention to it

897
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,580
people aren't aren't investing in it

898
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:30,640
it's a sad story the word that I kept

899
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:34,090
thinking of as I was doing this was

900
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,319
neglect because I mean not only these

901
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:39,220
these servers you know they're put

902
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:43,690
online people forget about them but but

903
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:46,240
we had in 1997 a open spec open to

904
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:50,230
implement programmatic access as

905
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,330
consumers to our data and it didn't

906
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,220
require a middleman it was private it

907
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:57,600
was between us and our bank the direct

908
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:00,040
line of trust and it got squandered our

909
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,400
personal finances could be so much

910
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,220
better today if if this trend had

911
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:11,380
continued instead of instead of sort of

912
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:14,890
going into maintenance mode what do we

913
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,670
do about it there's a lot of blame to go

914
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:21,310
around in the effects landscape I'm

915
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,770
actually worried that we'll just see a

916
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:26,770
slow decline and death of the protocol

917
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,540
and nothing will take its place because

918
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,820
there are no other standard api is to

919
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,770
access your bank but if we wanted to

920
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,260
invest if we wanted to think about the

921
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,850
future if we wanted to do something now

922
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,980
we got to get the biggest client maker

923
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:40,810
to start supporting the latest most

924
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,630
secure protocol we've got to get all

925
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,480
those sort of Enders to implement a more

926
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:47,710
secure software development lifecycle

927
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,600
and we have to get financial

928
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:53,290
institutions to care about a consumer

929
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,839
based API not just the web app but an

930
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,420
API for us I think a little writ plus

931
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,050
all the other you know sort of started B

932
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,330
cultures too

933
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,880
to make apps that help us with our

934
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:06,640
finances that's that's the hopeful

935
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:12,730
future if you're here and you have a

936
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:15,009
part of this talk to me do it or things

937
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:22,830
would just you know maintain the status

938
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:25,119
quo this is just recon I touched like

939
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:28,660
three percent of the spec with my

940
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:32,080
packets please take this and build off

941
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:34,210
of it this is one protocol endpoint in a

942
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,970
jumble of middleware and a very complex

943
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:42,300
system there's lots more here to hack

944
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:44,890
and I'm going to keep hacking on it and

945
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,960
thank you to my employer for paying the

946
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,660
time to do it thank you guys for for

947
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:56,150
listening

948
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:56,149
[Applause]

949
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:20,549
any questions yes well they break when

950
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:24,000
TLS breaks no the problem is the problem

951
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:25,290
is that there's no there's no

952
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,750
standardization across the ecosystem

953
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,940
right so there's these 15,000 banks that

954
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,090
consumers will not talk to and 2,000 of

955
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,100
them have a public interface so you have

956
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,190
to go to some consumer some screen

957
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:42,960
scraping as a service to even get to the

958
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,850
other 13,000 that you care about the the

959
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,400
hacker code the like open source code

960
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:49,140
was all individual people writing you

961
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,810
know individual one-off scripts and then

962
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,339
the people copying them and building off

963
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:55,980
them so I wouldn't say it's more secure

964
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:59,130
or even actually sustainable if you want

965
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:03,060
to keep track of more than like one or

966
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:13,800
two specific banks questions yes in the

967
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:15,660
middle yeah so the UK has it's called

968
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,220
open bank initiative it's government

969
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,980
mandated API to do to do what got went

970
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,720
wrong here I don't know a lot about it

971
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:29,850
because my focus has been on on this

972
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,140
area I know the nine largest banks in UK

973
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,060
they had to implement it I know they

974
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,220
deployed it I've talked to a few people

975
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,610
who are in the know they say it's it's

976
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,379
it's a show it's it's banks being

977
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:43,140
forced to do code they don't want to and

978
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,820
and so like to even enroll it's 15

979
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,420
clicks on the website they're trying to

980
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,310
hide it so it seems like a very good

981
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,620
idea from a specification but doesn't

982
