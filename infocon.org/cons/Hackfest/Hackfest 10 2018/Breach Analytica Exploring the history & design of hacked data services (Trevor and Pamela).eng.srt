1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
thank you all right it's the Sun okay

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,580
great

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,989
so today we're gonna be talking about a

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:16,580
project that Pam and I have been working

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:27,029
on for a little while now oh maybe

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:31,348
that's my cookie okay just bear with us

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,460
for a moment all right so today Pam and

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,020
I are gonna be talking about a project

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,420
that we've been working on for a little

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,930
while now and that project is called

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,790
breach analytic so what does breach an

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,320
elliptical you might be wondering well

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,140
it's uh it's a project that we've been

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,750
working on for a little while now and

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,770
it's a hack data search engine and

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,769
eventually we would like it to be a hack

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,660
data search service on the web but

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,780
that's not the focus of this talk today

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,940
we're actually going to be talking about

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,350
the historical timeline of hacktivists

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,180
earch services and we're also going to

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,339
be talking about well Pam's gonna be

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,400
talking about the design of a hack did a

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,310
search engine itself so before we get

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,880
into that let's do a quick little Who am

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,090
I so my name is Trevor Griffin my

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,310
colleagues call me Trev I am currently a

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,049
third-year undergraduate student at the

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,490
University of Ontario Institute of

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:29,400
Technology and I'm also a junior

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,919
security consultant for a cyber security

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,909
firm called AGID which was recently

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
acquired by KPMG so besides that I've

34
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,020
been interested in security communities

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,790
such as this one for a number of years

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,130
now before I even knew what InfoSec was

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,700
that goes back as early as 2013 to be

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,350
honest with you the specific niche area

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,899
that I've always been interested in has

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,449
been intelligence so that includes

41
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,960
investigative asim and intelligence

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,180
collections so that's a click run over

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,320
of who I am and I'll pass it off to Pam

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,719
hi I'm Pam hammer I also go to uit and I

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,508
also work for Ajit my passions include

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,160
InfoSec and development before we start

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,958
I want to give a quick shout out to the

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,299
professors at UOIT firstly

49
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,220
a year ago we were two students selected

50
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,480
to be sent here and you know without

51
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,760
that we wouldn't be here today and

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,310
secondly I want to give a shout out to a

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,040
g'd for all their support you actually

54
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,900
met them at hack Fest last year so it's

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,690
pretty special take it away

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,940
ok so we've kind of mentioned that we're

57
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,500
going to be talking about the history of

58
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,959
hack data search services and the design

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,730
of accolade a search engine so how

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,709
that's going to go is I'm going to talk

61
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,959
a bit about the hack data search

62
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,359
services and Pam will talk about the

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,280
search engine search engine design but

64
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:52,930
before we get into that I want to go

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,290
over a little bit of a data breach 101

66
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,940
so explore the foundation of why all of

67
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,760
this exists in the first place so we're

68
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,390
going to talk about the data breach

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,819
issue so let's start simple with the

70
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,578
information that this all revolves

71
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,589
around with a simple question what

72
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,379
happens when we register an account on a

73
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,069
website basic question but it needs to

74
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:19,780
be asked so when we go to a website we

75
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,578
normally see a registration form like

76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,459
the one behind me and it will ask you

77
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:28,450
for various pieces of information user

78
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:32,620
name email password the usual

79
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:35,649
so we all know about this but when we

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,510
submit that the account is added to a

81
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,849
database and a special table called user

82
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,010
table and every account gets its own

83
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,599
little special entry inside of this user

84
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,099
table but so using the information from

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,679
submitted here that'll create a account

86
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,448
entry and that'll be saved to the user

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,250
table where we have a number of account

88
00:03:52,449 --> 00:04:00,190
entries so this could be one or two or a

89
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,750
few dozen few hundred a few thousand a

90
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,940
few million billions so databases are

91
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,709
massive and I just want to highlight the

92
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,030
fact that these can store a lot of

93
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,000
sensitive personally identifiable

94
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,889
information and so it's a sensitive

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,139
target and attract an attractive target

96
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:21,370
a thought for adversaries so when your

97
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,380
server is compromised

98
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,210
there is a good chance that this data

99
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,070
will probably also be stored in the same

100
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,650
server if you have a smaller web form or

101
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,620
something like

102
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,469
so there's a good chance that somebody

103
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,669
is going to steal a copy of your user

104
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,550
table and that's been the case for a

105
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:43,490
number of large organizations including

106
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,400
social media of various kinds so myspace

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,970
LinkedIn VK which is like a Russian

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,388
Facebook and so forth even and we even

109
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,210
talked about Neopets which is a child's

110
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,130
game that has account entries from many

111
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,448
many years ago I'm even in that I think

112
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,820
I was five years old when I made an

113
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:07,850
account on that so and that still exists

114
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:10,580
today so these nine data breaches alone

115
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,840
total to just shy of 1.3 billion at

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,130
count entries which is pretty

117
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,710
significant when you think about the

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,900
fact that there's only like seven point

119
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,620
something billion people in the world so

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,510
that's pretty significant so we actually

121
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,979
got this data from a website called

122
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,169
vigilante PW and this website currently

123
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,539
supports about just shy of 4.5 billion

124
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:35,270
account entries derived from about just

125
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:38,960
shy of 4,600 data breach leaks and so

126
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,460
when I say 4600 I mean a ton just like

127
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,729
this but there's a lot of small ones in

128
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,340
there too but we specifically chose to

129
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,169
use vigilante for our statistics for a

130
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,599
reason that's because it's an accurate

131
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,010
representation of the data breach leaks

132
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,740
that exist on the market today

133
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,590
so these aren't fake numbers these

134
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,229
numbers are actually from somebody who

135
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,820
collects this data and actively tries to

136
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,590
collect as much as bit as possible and

137
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,050
indexes it keeps track of it on this

138
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,729
website there are some other websites

139
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,349
that will say though there's over 10

140
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,449
billion account entries floating around

141
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,740
the web that's kind of the case but

142
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,210
realistically the people who you're

143
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,070
worried about and the people who will

144
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,799
have access to the information like

145
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:23,240
ourselves even that's more realistic of

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,380
a number that were around now there are

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,520
some other services that have more than

148
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,620
that but this is a good baseline so it's

149
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,010
clear that we have a data problem on our

150
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,250
hands

151
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,800
and that problem is that data breach

152
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,870
leaks are everywhere and servers are

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,330
being compromised all the time and there

154
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,130
are people who actually have operations

155
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,800
dedicate

156
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,680
stealing this data and so what we've

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,150
seen is that a data market has been made

158
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,889
out of this because there's so much

159
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,159
demand for this personally identifiable

160
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,169
information and so much demand for newer

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,500
data sets or anything like that that

162
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,419
there has to be supply for it and thus

163
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,090
the suppliers our data brokers or

164
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:07,159
hackers directly and oftentimes they

165
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,520
work together to make a lot of money off

166
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,610
of this data your data so we have a

167
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,120
datum market and the thing about this

168
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,440
data market though is I'm sure the data

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,850
market has been around for a number of

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,550
years but it's only really picked up

171
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:27,830
pace and about the last five and going

172
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,880
back to the number vision vigilante 4.5

173
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,859
billion years ago it was considered a

174
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,650
lot to have like a hundred million

175
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,450
account entries in like 2013 or 2014

176
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,330
that would be very significant at that

177
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:45,580
time so being at four point five billion

178
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,599
now has shown a exponential increase so

179
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,740
with all of this data being in

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,360
circulation in these data markets this

181
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,850
data is becoming heavily saturated as

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,180
there's more brokers joining the data

183
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,310
market and so where a data set let's say

184
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,110
like den was worth a thousand dollars

185
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,200
last month this isn't a true number by

186
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,550
the way just a hypothetical so if a data

187
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,110
set was worth a thousand dollars last

188
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,639
month it could be worth a hundred

189
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,889
dollars this month because so many data

190
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,080
brokers have sold data over the last

191
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,270
month and by next month it could be ten

192
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,630
dollars and when it's like five or ten

193
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,940
dollars

194
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,580
well I even bother broking anymore so

195
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,400
what a lot of people or brokers will do

196
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,349
is try to make a name for themselves by

197
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,330
sharing this information and designated

198
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,680
communities or and their designated

199
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,020
networks so they actually leaked this

200
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,719
data publicly to make more of a name for

201
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,338
themselves or just due to the hacker

202
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,200
nature they just want to share the

203
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,880
information and they don't really have

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,680
much regard for the ethical

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
implementation implications of that

206
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,750
so public data leaks everywhere and

207
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,489
because the data market has become so

208
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,589
heavily saturated there is the one-off

209
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,990
person who just leaks the data every

210
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,570
time and this will be a continual

211
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,730
continuous

212
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:02,460
so there's a number of people who would

213
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,399
be interested in these data sets one

214
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:10,529
security researchers like us and you

215
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,930
guys and cyber criminals similar things

216
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:16,350
different goals

217
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:18,630
so what attackers will do is gather all

218
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,820
of the data put it into one massive

219
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,860
archive with hundreds or thousands of

220
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,080
data sets and they'll use a command such

221
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,120
as grep or sift to go through these data

222
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,310
sets it'll take a few minutes or an hour

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,260
or two hours depending on how much data

224
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,260
you have and how about your computer is

225
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:40,319
so the slang for that is a DB lookup so

226
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,649
you do a DB lookup you find the

227
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,160
credentials great and with this

228
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,630
information we find from the DB lookup

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,839
you can do an account compromise or an

230
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,430
account takeover attack or maybe you are

231
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,140
on a red team or a penetration or a

232
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,209
penetration tester you don't want to

233
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,680
bother even hacking the systems why even

234
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,170
bother hacking the systems if all you

235
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,150
have to do is go to a search engine or

236
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,969
your own archive fold the data and just

237
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,230
log into the accounts like you don't

238
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,060
even need to hack into anything you just

239
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,800
sign in so there's a number of use cases

240
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,380
in which an attacker could leverage

241
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,599
these data leaks to break into an

242
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,040
organization or a security researcher

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,779
could do it to raise security awareness

244
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,870
and further secure their infrastructure

245
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:30,870
so there's a data market there's supply

246
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,490
there's demand and what do we do in the

247
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,800
tech industry when we have a lot of

248
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,339
demand for something we make a service

249
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:45,120
for it so introducing hacked data as a

250
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:46,440
service yeah so great but really there

251
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,300
are hot data's search services and these

252
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,180
have been only created in the lab about

253
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,229
the last five years or so and they're

254
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,890
pretty straightforward if you think

255
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,170
about it they collect data breech leaks

256
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,130
they take this information they index it

257
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,779
into a database like what Pam's done and

258
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,240
they make searchable or they make it

259
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,290
queryable if that's a word so you can

260
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,220
query for

261
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:13,250
different pieces of information so you

262
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,650
could search for a username or an email

263
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,120
password a hash really anything that you

264
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,120
could match with like regular

265
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,520
expressions or something of the likes so

266
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,320
but even more simply than this if you

267
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,090
wanted a hack date a search service that

268
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,030
just had an email search tool all it

269
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,350
would be is just like this this is a

270
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,920
sample from have I been poned we'll talk

271
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,240
more about that later so you just put

272
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,959
your email in here it searches the

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,160
database and it tells you the results so

274
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,140
put simply if that's what a hack dated

275
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,120
search services so you're probably

276
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,340
wondering by now we have this data

277
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,410
problem and because of this problem and

278
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,300
the growing market behind it there's

279
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,189
hawk data search services but where the

280
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,880
hell did they get this data is probably

281
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:59,730
what you're wondering well as of reason

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,030
a lot of it comes from web forums such

283
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,710
as raid forums or hello forums and

284
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,780
different communities black markets and

285
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,660
so forth this is where all of the trades

286
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,860
sales and leaks take place and this is

287
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,410
probably where you're gonna find a lot

288
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,780
of your harder to get data that isn't

289
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,130
easily accessible on hosted database

290
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,670
archives which we'll talk about another

291
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,620
moment furthermore sometimes security

292
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,120
researchers see the benefit of hack data

293
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,850
search services and how they can be used

294
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,410
to improve security awareness and

295
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,200
properly and responsibly disclose data

296
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,670
leaks to the public so sometimes

297
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,670
security researchers just give people

298
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:39,660
like us access to this data just for the

299
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:43,110
greater good so looking at this point

300
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,510
hosted database archives what is that

301
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,770
well it's something like what we see

302
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:53,550
down here but a lot bigger so these are

303
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:55,890
archives of data that store a ton of

304
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,380
hacked data breaches or data breach

305
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,640
leaks I should say so how hard is it to

306
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,380
find one of these things it's really not

307
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,020
you just Google download pack databases

308
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,570
so oh wow what is this a public database

309
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,120
directory public TV host wonder what

310
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,560
that could be

311
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,740
biggest free to download collection of

312
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,030
publicly available website databases the

313
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,200
security researchers and journalists

314
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:29,010
of course of course

315
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,590
so we have a search bar we can look up

316
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:35,430
gaming and that does a pattern match for

317
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:38,040
every file with the word gaming in it so

318
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,569
I guess here we have network gaming a

319
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,829
bunch of random gaming forums with like

320
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:46,080
50,000 lines gaming radio shard gaming

321
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,730
whatever dark storm gaming calm is so

322
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,160
forth and it's really easy to download

323
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,320
you just click the download button it's

324
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,459
not that hard or more interestingly if

325
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,230
you just want all of them you could just

326
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,940
go to the archive in which they're

327
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,290
stored and he said W get commands

328
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,630
download all of them so it's clear that

329
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:07,410
there's a lot of data breach information

330
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,330
on the web how do we know it's true well

331
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,880
a lot of the time these data breach

332
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,370
leaks are in fact legitimate but

333
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,350
sometimes they're not that's because

334
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,470
it's an attractive opportunity to do

335
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,870
scamming or possibly do a misinformation

336
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,050
campaign against an a company perhaps a

337
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,120
competitor and it really shouldn't come

338
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,819
with much surprise that data breaches

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,980
are fabricated for these reasons

340
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,770
especially for scams when stealing

341
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,890
databases to sell is a really lucrative

342
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,480
opportunity so one data set could be

343
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,360
sold for hundreds or thousands of

344
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,490
dollars attractive scamming opportunity

345
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:50,370
if you asked me and many people on how

346
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:52,440
forums would agree so how do we prove

347
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,770
that these data breach leaks are in fact

348
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,360
real or fake well there's a number of

349
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,980
things we could do we could go through

350
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,160
the account information checks the user

351
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,360
names and emails are these in here are

352
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,250
their matches

353
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,280
how many account records are in this

354
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,500
data breach leak if there's a hundred

355
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,660
thousand records for the state of reach

356
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,250
leak and there's only twenty thousand

357
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,390
people on the website it's probably fake

358
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,640
but more interesting let's talk about a

359
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,470
process made by another security

360
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,449
researcher and a friend of mine Allison

361
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,480
Nixon when she worked at Deloitte she

362
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,010
did a white paper on vetting leaks so

363
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,050
there's a few key points that she

364
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,520
brought it down to for vetting if a leak

365
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,800
is fake so first

366
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,750
check if the leak is recycled so if you

367
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,589
have an archive evolve this of all of

368
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,420
these datasets and you can take one

369
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,180
piece of information from the data

370
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,729
bridge leak in question and search

371
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,109
through all of the archives and see if

372
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,149
there's any matches if there's a match

373
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,660
and it's the same information in two

374
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:59,540
sets well your data breach leak at hand

375
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,040
or in question it's probably fake so

376
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,189
that's the first indicator I would look

377
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,829
for and many others would next you could

378
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,940
grab a subset of emails or usernames and

379
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,839
check for uniqueness and existence in it

380
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,750
there's a number of ways you can do that

381
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,830
that's not the point of this so yeah you

382
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,480
could also check the password policy

383
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:23,800
adherence and look at the passwords but

384
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:26,209
honestly who wants to do that so yeah so

385
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,719
that pretty much concludes our data

386
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:31,579
breach 101 to understand the

387
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,140
foundational issue at hand does cause

388
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,529
there to be hack data search services

389
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,670
created and hack data search engines and

390
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,470
it's important that we understand that a

391
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,649
data problem exists and that is an

392
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,140
exponentially growing issue at hand

393
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,730
whether we realize it or not and it will

394
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,800
continue to be a growing issue and

395
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,360
that's why hack data search services

396
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,760
started being a thing about five years

397
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,839
ago when this issue really started to

398
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,130
pick up pace and even today so we're

399
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,709
going to talk we're just gonna go over a

400
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,760
timeline of search services that have

401
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,419
been created over the last five years

402
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,859
starting from the beginning to now and

403
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,329
we'll also talk about the ethical

404
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,020
implications of each one of these

405
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,938
services

406
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,720
well not each one we're just gonna focus

407
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:17,569
on three of these but so a number of

408
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,850
years ago I'm sure that somebody else

409
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,428
had this idea before anybody on here and

410
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:25,129
they probably had their own local search

411
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,350
services for this data but the first

412
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,570
website to really come forward and make

413
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,730
a big thing out of it and really brand

414
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,379
themselves on it and coin the coin all

415
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,130
of this was how they've been poned and

416
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,690
they were founded in December 2013 since

417
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,550
then there's been a number of new

418
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,559
services and these are just the ones

419
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,120
that I considered to be noteworthy or

420
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,168
talk worthy for that matter and

421
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,989
yeah all of these leading up to uh

422
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:54,669
analytical seem to come but we don't

423
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,679
have time to talk about all of these

424
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:59,799
sort is gonna put an emphasis on three

425
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,260
of these have I been poned leaked source

426
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,270
and stuff space so just out of curiosity

427
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,770
how many people in this room know what

428
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,970
these are you just like raise your hand

429
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,990
okay so like all of you but we're still

430
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,390
there's still a few people who didn't

431
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,850
put their hands up so we're gonna take a

432
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,860
introductory approach with this so I

433
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,689
chose these three services because

434
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,149
they're the closest representations I

435
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,010
could get to the hacker hat system so

436
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:26,918
how many of you know what black hats

437
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,990
white hats and gray hats are so like all

438
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,730
of you but we're still going to talk

439
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,330
about the terminology real quick so

440
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:37,510
black hat is a hacker or malicious actor

441
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,870
for that matter who engages in nefarious

442
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,250
activities so oftentimes as illegal and

443
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,309
there's little to no regard for ethics

444
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,809
at all so they're unethical white-hot on

445
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,908
the other hand is the exact opposite of

446
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,178
this they try their best to follow laws

447
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:56,020
and they try their best to be ethical

448
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:58,539
and gray hats are somewhere in between

449
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,260
this area it's a gray area their name

450
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:04,629
and where they might not have as much

451
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,309
regard for laws they might do what they

452
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,669
considered to be ethical according to

453
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,350
their virtue ethics so have I been poned

454
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,750
is our example of a white hat search

455
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,908
service leak source will be our example

456
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,270
of a black hat search service you'll see

457
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:23,649
why and enough space is our example of a

458
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:26,590
gray house search service so have I been

459
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:28,120
poned was originally founded in 2013 in

460
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,730
December by Troy hunt

461
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:35,139
Troy hunt is a well vetted security

462
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:40,149
researcher within our industry yeah he's

463
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:42,580
a Microsoft MVP etc credentials etc so

464
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,928
have I been poned is the it can be

465
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,750
thought of as the original hack data

466
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,149
search service and what's great about

467
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,159
them is that they're white-hot they're

468
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,678
ethical and responsible and they've done

469
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,000
a lot to really push forward security

470
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,110
awareness around this topic and that's

471
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,060
why many of you have heard of this

472
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:02,129
because of have I been poned probably

473
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,149
so have I been pone offers a free search

474
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,250
service and that's what they're most

475
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,920
known for their free search email for

476
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,610
free email search service which anybody

477
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,960
can go to this website and just it looks

478
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,550
like this by the way and just search for

479
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,550
an email and they'll tell you the

480
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,409
results they also have a number of other

481
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,760
things like a verified domain search so

482
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,920
if any of you want to check if you have

483
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,860
employee credentials for your companies

484
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,240
you can prove you can verify that you

485
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,010
are who you say you are you work with

486
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,280
this company and they'll help you

487
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,780
identify your employees credentials they

488
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,950
also have a password search service and

489
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,690
a number of other things preacher to

490
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,970
faith breach notification subscription

491
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,620
lists and so forth but what's what's

492
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,360
great about how i've been poned is that

493
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,429
they've been privacy respecting through

494
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,750
all of this they act with integrity and

495
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:50,610
transparency so for those of you who may

496
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,670
have maybe not seen this before this is

497
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,649
their website have i been poned calm

498
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,350
where they currently have approximately

499
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,000
5.5 billion account credentials indexed

500
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,310
derived from about three hundred and

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,350
seventeen data breach leaks so trying

502
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,639
the service we just search for tested

503
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,730
pest calm which shows up in one hundred

504
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,690
eighty seven breaches a number of pace

505
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,790
scrolling down on the same page a little

506
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,060
you'll see descriptors of these data

507
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:20,970
breaches so this would include the data

508
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,700
breach leak date dates a description of

509
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:28,020
what happened and the compromised data

510
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,330
contents so we talked about how this is

511
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,250
a new thing have i been poned was

512
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,110
originally founded in 2013 they started

513
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,450
off with like thirty million records or

514
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,419
something like that by october of 2014

515
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,630
they had just just shy of 200 million

516
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,630
account credentials derives from about

517
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,580
thirty-four data breach leaks and by the

518
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,810
time it was twenty sixteen it was just

519
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,720
shy of two billion with 168 breaches and

520
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,780
by 2018 this number is nearly doubled or

521
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,990
actually more than doubled with 5.5

522
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:05,340
billion account credentials derived from

523
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:08,220
317 breaches and by 2020 I don't know

524
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,370
it'll probably be more like 10 billion

525
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,420
or something like that

526
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:18,360
apparently it's mandatory the God means

527
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:20,910
to these things so we've talked about

528
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,250
how have I been poned is a ethical

529
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:26,520
search service what about the unethical

530
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,230
search service like source how many of

531
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,559
you in here have used leaked source for

532
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:36,210
their own security research purposes

533
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:38,250
only one ok so I assume some of you just

534
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,780
don't want to admit to this all right

535
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,920
so probably like a quarter of this room

536
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,500
and in recent years they were a

537
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,260
notoriously known hack data search

538
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,450
service they were just like have I been

539
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,980
poned in many ways they look a little

540
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,720
bit more leap though and in addition to

541
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,200
their free search service which offers

542
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,309
limited data results as you can see here

543
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,530
you could also pay for this information

544
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:10,590
so the results aren't limited they

545
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,750
aren't censored at all so if you want to

546
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:17,909
look up my information in this database

547
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,770
you can for two dollars and you can also

548
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,179
get access to my old passwords you know

549
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,490
how I mentioned that I was in Neopets

550
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,790
when I was five well that data that from

551
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,860
me

552
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,659
when I was five years old or something

553
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:32,219
like that you could buy but there's some

554
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,679
problems with that and this is what

555
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,220
makes this an unethical and illegal

556
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,420
search service and apparently this has

557
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,670
something to do with trafficking

558
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:45,450
identity identity information apparently

559
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,940
the RCMP agrees with me so leaks Orascom

560
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,910
by the way I want to mention that the

561
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,990
founder Jordan Bloom is based out of the

562
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,540
Toronto area

563
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:59,700
I think Richmond Hill I think but that's

564
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:01,559
irrelevant now wherever he is now and he

565
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,970
made it about 250,000 dollars off of

566
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,570
selling the state of breach leaked

567
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,220
information over a couple years

568
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,629
RCMP didn't like that so I think we can

569
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,760
agree that it's probably a blackout

570
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:18,450
service and kind of going back to this a

571
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,510
point to take away is probably shouldn't

572
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,950
sell people's personal information

573
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,330
especially when I have passwords

574
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,960
so this brings me to my next point it's

575
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:31,030
not space our great house service I

576
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,460
don't really know where in the spectrum

577
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,010
of the hot system they actually sit but

578
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm gonna go with great for now what

579
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,820
makes them interesting is that they

580
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,520
don't provide any free search service at

581
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,260
all it's very clean they have a

582
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,730
dashboard for businesses and they put an

583
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,920
emphasis on business-to-business sales

584
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,770
so even though there's still likely

585
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,890
source and they do sell access to any of

586
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,930
you they do try to put an emphasis on

587
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,440
selling to businesses which I think has

588
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,880
some ethical features to it because you

589
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,980
can use this to improve security

590
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,820
awareness within your organization you

591
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,830
could use the service to find maybe what

592
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,179
credentials have been leaked from your

593
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,770
employees and you can actually act on

594
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,960
that then you could go and give them a

595
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,510
practical real security awareness

596
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,790
training session without spooking them

597
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:24,340
too much they also operate that website

598
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,870
databases today so you know that's data

599
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,970
break it's not data archives that we

600
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,889
looked at earlier yeah they run that so

601
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,760
that might be more in the blackout side

602
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:35,470
but they disagree so this is not space a

603
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
little more a bit more clean looking

604
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,290
than the other features something that

605
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,149
you'd maybe want to buy for your

606
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:44,200
business that's why they took a startup

607
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:46,590
like approach to offering this so they

608
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,320
saw the businesses also to people and

609
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:53,560
they put a special emphasis on account

610
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,090
takeover prevention so they want you to

611
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,830
use their services to help prevent

612
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,919
account takeover attacks within your

613
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:03,310
organization they also and that's useful

614
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,260
to many companies that could also be

615
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,120
useful to law enforcement agencies or

616
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,620
private investigators anybody doing

617
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,229
things like fraud investigation

618
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,969
investigation into cybercrime maybe you

619
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,650
want to help there if I or you want to

620
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,870
use some information from this in a

621
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,090
court case to prove that somebody had a

622
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,169
certain account somewhere and so forth

623
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,540
so there's number of ways that this

624
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:27,220
could be used practically within our

625
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:32,010
society without abusing it so by now

626
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,010
you're wondering probably is this legal

627
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,460
it's a gray area and that's why I've

628
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,760
been we've been talking about ethics so

629
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,980
much

630
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,870
I'm not a lawyer so I can't tell you the

631
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,169
exact distinctions and where the

632
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,939
legality lies in all this and the

633
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,160
legality of these different services but

634
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,450
there's been a lot of support by for

635
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,540
have I've been pwned by governments

636
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,890
organizations and law enforcement alike

637
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,809
the opposite was the case for leaked

638
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:01,510
source and those were our two major case

639
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:03,970
studies so sauce based claims that when

640
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,280
a hacked data breach or a data breach

641
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,169
leak circulates in the public market for

642
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,510
long enough and it gets exposed to the

643
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,250
Internet surface it becomes a part of

644
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,690
the public domain some people would

645
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,700
disagree because you probably don't

646
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,160
think that your password is a part of

647
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,500
the public domain even if it is

648
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,419
available they also claim that you're

649
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,669
allowed to distribute this information

650
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,610
as researchers in their case including

651
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:29,230
passwords all of you got to draw some

652
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,659
ethical lines there and they also

653
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,950
claimed that selling this type of data

654
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,880
is legal in most Western countries

655
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,620
including the United States but that's

656
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,780
kind of contradictory when we look at

657
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:46,299
this so okay so that brings us to our

658
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,520
next point the galatea side it's

659
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,799
important that if we're creating a hack

660
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,059
data search service we draw some ethical

661
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,679
boundaries and determine where those are

662
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,720
so by looking at how I've been hone

663
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,390
leaked source and snut space we can

664
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,190
learn from their rights and wrongs and

665
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,900
pull away a few points so if you want to

666
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,570
make a hack day to search service first

667
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,160
things first you as the operator need to

668
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,120
be responsible because you have a lot of

669
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,580
power in your hands you have a lot of

670
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,709
data so it's really important that you

671
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,870
handle that data well you protect it

672
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,669
well and you respect people's privacy

673
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,469
and that's probably the most important

674
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,940
point here because when you are handling

675
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,910
four or five billion account credentials

676
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,320
like we are you have to respect that

677
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,970
each one of those entries even though a

678
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,280
lot of them are probably BOTS are also

679
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:31,020
people and you need to like respect

680
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,129
their right to privacy so with that said

681
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,750
don't be the cause of account takeover

682
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,640
attacks don't be Willy don't be like

683
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,720
leaked source and offer a service for

684
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,690
people to use and abuse and by privacy

685
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,190
laws because you're not exempt so if

686
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,200
somebody wants to Oh

687
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,620
somebody wants to remove their account

688
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,320
from these data breach leaks let them

689
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:58,159
and this kind of brings me down to a few

690
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,780
key points from the CIA triad and I

691
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,150
actually learned about the CIA triad

692
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:07,580
from my computer security professor

693
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:10,340
right here Garret Hayes hi Garrett so

694
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,689
let's talk about confidentiality well

695
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:16,669
it's important that for handling this

696
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,780
data we do so with securities so we want

697
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,970
to make sure that we protect this data

698
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,830
and we handle it well everything's

699
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,120
confidential and safe and sound and

700
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,500
private also verified integrity so we've

701
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,629
talked about how the great part about

702
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,820
have I've been poned is the transparency

703
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,940
and tag and integrity behind the

704
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:38,600
operator running it troy hunt friendly

705
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,340
face to this community so act with

706
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,830
integrity when you're being an operator

707
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,560
of one of these services and lastly

708
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,889
limited availability so if you're

709
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,659
offering one of these search services

710
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,210
limit the information based on the

711
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,310
client some organizations might need raw

712
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,630
access to this information and that's

713
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,210
just the case because criminals have

714
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,570
access to it too but you don't just sell

715
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,500
this data to anybody with a dollar and

716
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,060
claiming that they will be your next

717
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,490
customer you need to actually bet your

718
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:11,090
customers and select which crowds you

719
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,490
want to make this an attractive service

720
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,699
to so with all these ethical boundaries

721
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:20,360
and taken into consideration we thought

722
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,430
how can we use this to better what we're

723
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,729
creating our project for each analytic

724
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,620
and I'm gonna pass this off to Pam now

725
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,990
and she's gonna talk a little bit more

726
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,360
about what we've done with our breach

727
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,120
analytical project and the design of

728
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,030
hacked data search engines so off to you

729
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,800
Pam Thank You Trev so I'm sure that's

730
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,220
been made clear that we in fact have

731
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,200
created our own breach database and now

732
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,420
is the part where I'm supposed to tell

733
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,280
you how we did it but I'm not gonna make

734
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,530
it that easy what I'm going to do

735
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,889
instead is show you our journey or

736
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,810
otherwise known as the process and a key

737
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,150
point I would like to make is that I

738
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,720
revisited my notebook to show you our

739
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,539
actual

740
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,700
process some of these thoughts questions

741
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,919
and notes are referenced from this book

742
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,250
and I do this because I want to show you

743
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,740
that in times it was painful but we did

744
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,780
it and what makes it beautiful is that

745
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,669
there are no tutorials or guides for

746
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,980
this we couldn't just watch a YouTube

747
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,740
video or read a medium article we had to

748
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,929
carve our own way every problem we faced

749
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,270
had no necessarily right or wrong

750
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:28,880
solution and just a problem that we had

751
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,918
to solve and when we solved it it

752
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,210
usually contained three or four more

753
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:40,580
problems so without further ado let's go

754
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:42,679
to problem 1 actually taking this back

755
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,980
this is what we thought this project

756
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,510
would look like and this is what it

757
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:53,690
actually looked like so without further

758
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:56,750
ado let's go to problem 1 what in the

759
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,970
hell is a hot data search engine I had

760
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,980
this question when trev came to me with

761
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,559
all this data and said I think we should

762
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,169
build this I thought what in the hell is

763
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,178
a hack data search engine but as silly

764
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:10,640
as this question is it had to be asked

765
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:12,919
because before you begin the process you

766
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,100
have to understand what the process is I

767
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,539
mean what really are we building here

768
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,059
what we think we want is the search

769
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:22,490
engine so we thought how does Google

770
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:25,580
work and from what we could find Google

771
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,679
sort of works like this roughly you have

772
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,320
web crawlers that crawl the web and pull

773
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,900
raw data then you have an indexer which

774
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,210
takes that raw data and builds an index

775
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,669
store it inside of a database then you

776
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,679
have a search engine which determines

777
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:41,059
what it is you're searching for and then

778
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,010
takes that data from the database

779
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,740
and then lastly you have your user

780
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:49,429
interface and when we looked at this we

781
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:51,890
saw ok we have the raw data we need to

782
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:54,320
build an indexer which is going to take

783
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,990
that raw data and build our index stored

784
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,389
inside of our database and then lastly

785
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,100
we just need a user interface because we

786
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,549
know what people are searching for and

787
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,939
now you can see a clear process and on

788
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:10,580
to problem two how do we want our index

789
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,559
to be formatted or in other words what

790
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,949
is the design of our database going to

791
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,950
look like

792
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,400
we first had to decide what data we

793
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,469
wanted to put in our database we know

794
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,510
that breach data can contain a multitude

795
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,700
of things but we decided to keep it

796
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:31,629
simple for stage one we ended up

797
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,580
choosing just emails and file names and

798
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,680
when we looked at this data we noticed

799
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,310
it for in a sort of hierarchy like

800
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,710
structure you can see that each domain

801
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,080
name may have multiple emails associated

802
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:48,260
with that domain and that each file may

803
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,570
contain multiple emails and after some

804
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,280
research we saw that this could

805
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,649
translate to a sequel relational

806
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,570
database and IRA do this for better

807
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:01,870
quality so here we have a domain table a

808
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:05,240
master email table and a file table and

809
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,520
from our master table we can link the

810
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,159
associated domains and files with

811
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,080
foreign keys and then we can sort of

812
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,929
build on top of this say if we wanted to

813
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,090
add content table table or content data

814
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:20,929
to the file table we would only need to

815
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,550
edit that table and now the now that we

816
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,040
know the structure of our database

817
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:28,340
the next question or problem comes down

818
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,710
to how do we pull this data from those

819
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,320
data breaches and essentially add it to

820
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,900
our database following this design and

821
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,620
we sort of broke this down into two

822
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,020
parts the first data selection pulling

823
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:44,960
those emails and file names from those

824
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,330
data breaches and what we did here was

825
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,909
we created a small program that walked

826
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:53,380
all of these files and found an instance

827
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:57,049
of every email and we did this using

828
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,880
regular expressions but this part wasn't

829
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,860
necessarily easy we went through

830
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,140
multiple regular expressions before we

831
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,030
found the one with the best outcome and

832
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,460
I'll show you an example you can see

833
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:10,130
here the first two are legitimate

834
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,860
looking emails but the last isn't

835
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,650
legitimate and depending on the red X it

836
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,690
may end up selecting all options as

837
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,980
emails which would be a false positive

838
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,510
or it may not select the entire email

839
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,810
resulting in a false negative here's

840
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,330
another example but with some trial and

841
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,450
error

842
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,270
we have were eventually able to craft a

843
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:36,930
rag axe with the most successful outcome

844
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:42,750
which is a small victory so now that our

845
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:44,850
script is done well our script was

846
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,920
designed to create one massive file with

847
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,020
an instance of every email found and

848
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,230
I'll show an example of one line but

849
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,200
with the database design we want it to

850
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,930
look like this so the next problem comes

851
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,290
down to how do we convert this to this

852
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,970
and so here's where more of our

853
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,759
scripting knowledge came to play we were

854
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:08,160
able to create a second program to

855
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,790
translate this master file into this

856
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,310
relational structure but before we could

857
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:18,080
push this to the database we had to

858
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,080
ensure the success of this translation

859
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,420
we had to ensure that there was no

860
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,250
duplicate data that the foreign keys

861
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,440
were mapped correctly and that the data

862
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,840
was clean and correct as to our

863
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,420
knowledge now once this can be properly

864
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,180
insured the data can then be pushed to a

865
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,400
database and the final quest question

866
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,850
comes down to how can we make this

867
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,760
database as fast as we know how to with

868
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,950
roughly 4 to 5 billion accounts the

869
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,220
question of speed comes down to database

870
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:52,169
optimization now this isn't a part I

871
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,660
want to go to into depth as my knowledge

872
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,580
of databases is limited but I did want

873
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,009
to point out that we put a lot of stress

874
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,990
on the essence of speed and we were able

875
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,060
to reach our performance goals by

876
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,970
implementing the sequel what is known as

877
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,470
an index now I use it the term index a

878
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,080
little loosely and I apologize for that

879
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,689
but what I'm referring to here is the

880
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,490
data structure that sequel uses to

881
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,580
retrieve data in a short amount of time

882
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,470
and without that I just wanted to point

883
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,650
out that this statement was executed in

884
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,870
the process and what better way to end

885
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:30,260
this portion of the talk than to show

886
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:30,259
you a quick example of our database yeah

887
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:36,900
so we actually prepared a prototype

888
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,170
database just here in the Python

889
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,859
appended and so this isn't actually the

890
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,589
search service

891
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:46,710
we want to have publicly available with

892
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:50,038
breach analytic cut and time but here's

893
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,450
a prototype for better type yeses so you

894
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,640
can do an email search or a domain

895
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,859
search if you want to do an email search

896
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,038
feel free to find us later but we

897
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:04,140
figured we might as well do like CAC

898
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:09,539
fest so you can see that there were

899
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:17,160
three and it's bound and that's just our

900
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:18,960
prototype so now that we have this

901
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,779
database I'm sure you all are wondering

902
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,940
what do we plan to do with it and the

903
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:26,489
question is it really set in stone per

904
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,440
se but we plan on following in similar

905
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:35,160
footsteps as how about a phone in an

906
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:37,859
ethical and in a responsible manner so

907
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,989
moving forward while we do plan on being

908
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,339
ethical and responsible we also think

909
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:43,769
that there's some responsibility on

910
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:46,680
organizations everywhere to consider

911
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:48,649
this exponentially growing problem when

912
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,049
they're doing security awareness so

913
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,930
consider using hack data search services

914
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:56,940
as a part of your process for improving

915
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,828
improving your security or your

916
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,890
organization organizational security

917
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,420
awareness and also to make sure that you

918
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,730
don't have leaked credentials for your

919
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,739
organization on the web so there's lots

920
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,420
of ways that you can use that but that's

921
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,569
what our goal will be to help you do

922
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,970
with breach analytical and so we have a

923
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:18,599
website at breach analytic accom where

924
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,399
we will eventually post updates and we

925
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,859
also have a Twitter account so feel free

926
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,620
to follow us on our journey and thank

927
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:33,990
you so much for being here thank you

928
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:42,220
[Applause]

929
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:55,689
so are there any questions yeah no

930
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:58,839
blocks in questions yes so on live

931
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:01,120
servers no but to actually do all of

932
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,070
this it's mandatory that you do a handle

933
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,339
the raw information including password

934
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,590
hashes and plaintext passwords so we do

935
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,330
have offline secured it fully disk

936
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:13,180
encrypted drives in which we store this

937
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,830
data on and we do on offline tests to

938
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,299
actually work with the data but for

939
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,130
anything that will be on live servers in

940
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,700
the future with services we will only

941
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:24,790
have emails available online so we're

942
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:32,020
very careful about how we handle our

943
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:34,060
information so yeah okay so the question

944
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,610
is is how do we plan on differentiating

945
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,370
ourselves from different search engines

946
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:42,550
well honestly a lot of them are the same

947
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:45,670
idea we're not that different but we saw

948
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,230
an opportunity to do this ourselves and

949
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,440
honestly this is just a fun research and

950
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,440
development project for us and yeah so

951
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:01,750
the question was is this going to be

952
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,160
open source no I mean I talked about the

953
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,110
structure of the database and that was

954
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,240
kind of just like showing you a kind of

955
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,160
a thought process along the way but the

956
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,589
actual code itself probably not we don't

957
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,270
want to just give that to anyone that

958
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,550
has access to it it's it's not

959
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:19,030
particularly like super complicated or

960
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,950
anything but it won't be open sourcing

961
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,480
and also if we were to open source

962
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,339
something like this I actually had

963
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,310
somebody bringing the point up to me of

964
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,020
open sourcing such project very recently

965
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,970
and they were talking about how they

966
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,160
wanted to create something similar but

967
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,990
rather than offering the service they

968
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,410
just want to write the code that would

969
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,459
create such service an open source set

970
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,379
it'll probably happen eventually

971
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,660
somebody will do it but personally I

972
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,090
want to advise against it because by

973
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,660
open sourcing a project like this even

974
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,360
though we said

975
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,980
it's not really that hard to make by

976
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,540
open sourcing it you're providing the

977
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,670
code for script kitty is an amateur

978
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:58,000
hackers and people on websites like hack

979
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,010
forums net to go ahead and create their

980
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,480
own hack day to search services and we

981
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,950
don't need more paid hack day to search

982
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,660
services showing people's passwords

983
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:16,419
because not all people aren't

984
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:18,549
responsible and ethical ourselves so the

985
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,870
question was how are we going to vet our

986
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:24,550
clients or end-users so people will be

987
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,250
able to search for their information

988
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:33,220
like email addresses and usernames

989
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:35,080
eventually and the the thing is we won't

990
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,759
actually show you any of the raw

991
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,350
information like we said we are only

992
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,180
storing the data breach information and

993
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:45,730
user sorry email addresses on the

994
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,470
website as of right now well actually we

995
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:53,350
don't have the website up yet but long

996
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:56,080
story short we won't show any private

997
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,000
information beyond just an email to the

998
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,049
person querying the database and we

999
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,820
aren't actually offering any

1000
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,340
business-to-business sales or anything

1001
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,050
like that at this point in time anyway I

1002
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:09,070
don't know where that's gonna go who

1003
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:11,230
knows but if we were to ever get to that

1004
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:14,070
point or if other service providers were

1005
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:16,630
to explore business-to-business sales

1006
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,030
you definitely should come up with some

1007
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,900
type of process for vetting your clients

1008
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,330
because you shouldn't just sell this

1009
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,370
data to anybody but overall I don't have

1010
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,049
a very straightforward answer to at the

1011
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,160
moment because we don't doing business

1012
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,540
to bail we aren't doing

1013
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:35,730
business-to-business sales so does I

1014
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,730
answer your question thank you

1015
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:58,600
okay so I think the question is okay so

1016
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,550
I think the question is is are we being

1017
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,190
considerate of more sensitive data

1018
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,510
breaches like Ashley Madison when we're

1019
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,390
providing people the searching

1020
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:10,810
opportunity as of right now we've chosen

1021
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:13,000
to not index Ashley Madison for similar

1022
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,779
reasons as why joy hunt hasn't with

1023
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,880
happy been poned

1024
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:20,550
but that's something we'll consider in

1025
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,510
the future more but right now we

1026
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,430
honestly right now I'm not too sure what

1027
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,110
we'll do about that because this is just

1028
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,390
the starting of this project this is the

1029
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:31,120
first time we've even actually mentioned

1030
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,700
it publicly so but moving forward we

1031
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,799
will try to be considerate in making our

1032
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:40,439
decisions of sensitivity of this data

1033
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,440
breach information like Ashley Madison

1034
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,169
okay so this is similar to the question

1035
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,360
previous I previously asked what is

1036
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,700
different about our hoc data search

1037
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,320
service and the answer is not much we

1038
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,609
just wanted to do it ourselves and we

1039
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,680
want to see if we can do it better and

1040
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,420
honestly I like the name breach analytic

1041
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,190
huh and which name would you rather stay

1042
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:09,240
in a board room have I been poned or

1043
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:09,240
breach analytic a just saying

1044
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,430
[Applause]
