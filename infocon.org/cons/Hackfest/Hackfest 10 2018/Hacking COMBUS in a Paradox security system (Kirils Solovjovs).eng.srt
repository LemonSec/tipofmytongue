1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,428
hello so some time ago I managed to find

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,519
a couple interesting features in in this

3
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:16,470
security system made by paradox and then

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,900
I see hackfest decade coming along gets

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,029
in Canada so I think well where else

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,288
would I presented since paradox is a

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:29,550
Canadian company so a little bit about

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,890
myself I'm a lead researcher at possible

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,370
security that is Latvia Riga our weather

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,760
is approximately the same quality as

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,089
Quebec weather so I feel right at home

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,800
I love cracking and breaking things and

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,350
throughout my life and throughout my

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,059
career I went through different stages

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,780
and different different focuses so the

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,169
deepest knowledge I probably have is in

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,579
the network flow analysis and so a lot

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,190
of looking in network I love doing 11th

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,700
of live Network forensics and checking

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,158
stuff out of course reversing isn't far

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,020
from that so then I moved on into

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,360
reverse engineering which is what this

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,330
talk is about and it is about the

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,549
network and we're at about the pass um

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,899
then I got a bit bored so I'm also moved

26
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,400
forward into social engineering I'm

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,700
happy to see social engineering village

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,979
here finally was able to look at one in

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,140
person in real life and a bit

30
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,908
unconventional I've I've also done some

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,610
work in the legal dimension of cyber

32
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,439
security so paper works writing laws and

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,659
stuff like that so I'm kind of versatile

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,119
versatile guy and I'm on Twitter as well

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,369
so as soon as I got back home I will

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,229
resume tweeting so I can follow me there

37
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:50,850
for for updates on stuff so the company

38
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,210
I worked for there is one slide about

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,829
that so we do penetration testing and

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,048
all the team we do consulting and

41
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,009
trainings and we also of course

42
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,180
so-called problems and with reverse

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,439
engineering even though this

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,689
presentation is not related to the

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,020
company I just want to say thanks to

46
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,940
them for paying for half of my travel

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,180
here even though this presentation is

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,740
not endorsed or connecting connected

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,200
with them

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,660
so we're gonna have a live demo as well

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,100
so that'll be exciting I always try to

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,560
do live demos even though they sometimes

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,540
fail I learned if you test them three

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,300
times that if there is 90% chance it's

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,640
gonna work so I hope it really works and

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,410
the goal was the position today the

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,079
structure that I built into the

58
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,590
presentation I chose it so that you can

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,300
not only recreate the research I've done

60
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,210
but also reapplies if the other devices

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,500
so if there are any potential reverse

62
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,160
engineers out there who would like to

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,750
try out this new field I'll try I try to

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,670
include as much video as possible so you

65
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,620
can actually do this on an unknown

66
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,239
system and and and try to take a look at

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,520
it not only security system any kind of

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,100
closed source system is a communication

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,420
bus so let's jump right in

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,829
as I said it's a Canadian company

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,640
product security systems they are

72
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,550
founded in 1999 and they make modular

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,410
security our security alarms how many of

74
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,520
you have not heard of Bardock security

75
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,190
systems a bit about a half about a half

76
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,140
ok and maybe some of you have that at

77
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,240
home or at work ok like 20 20 percent ok

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,549
so don't don't hack it unless it's yours

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,610
and unless a security company agrees

80
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,480
right so what's important to this talk

81
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,970
is that they make three kinds of

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,940
security security systems so the basic

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,489
ground is spectrum and it's expandable

84
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,170
security system so you get you get your

85
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,760
setup you can plug modules you can

86
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,208
protect doors you can protect windows

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,130
and so on but that's that's it basically

88
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,600
I mean it's it's ok it works it does

89
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,060
everything it needs so you can do

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,340
anything with any of these dancers ever

91
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,440
and ever Mogollon it's it's marking the

92
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,820
sky security and access system so it

93
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,920
provides higher security it's meant for

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,959
as I say banks and places like that you

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,559
can integrate it with a rfid reader and

96
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,410
so on and then we have the third one my

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,579
colon which is wireless security system

98
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,548
which is basically combination of the

99
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,070
two in in in wireless so if you don't

100
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,510
want to ruin your new flat or new house

101
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,849
with wireless you just used all these

102
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,300
wireless sensors supposedly very secure

103
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,800
and

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,800
you can can work from there so I want to

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,569
do a shout out to two guys that have

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,780
done some prior research on the topic so

107
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:45,979
there was some research on working some

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,419
research and interfacing with Viacom bus

109
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,610
but for the Specter series so for the

110
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,378
less secure one it was done by market

111
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,650
mattnic rosanna so you can check that

112
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:58,169
out if you like the code he supplied is

113
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,909
partially working and I recently check

114
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,780
and he moved on to working with serial

115
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:06,539
instead of combis actually and then for

116
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,340
for Mogollon people are working with

117
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,159
serial port we will take a look at what

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,750
that is exactly and was a difference so

119
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,719
it's all over the place people asking

120
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,150
how do I get data from my product system

121
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:19,349
how do I connect it and then some people

122
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,090
answering

123
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,560
there are also leaked documents I mean

124
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,599
there is nothing secret I think is

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,280
commercial and if you sign the idea you

126
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,139
can get them and then you also have them

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,270
just lying around online some some PDFs

128
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,330
for the serial port so that's something

129
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,520
we can use and get this terminal excused

130
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,289
from leukemia which is not Latvia but

131
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,609
the neighboring country also has

132
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,020
published some code on github but once

133
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,190
again this is for serial port which is

134
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,500
less interesting for what we're doing

135
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,060
here now of course I did follow

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,569
responsible slaughter process as well

137
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,710
and this is how it went I know that some

138
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,960
of you here in the audience have also

139
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,000
tried response causing to do this

140
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,400
company so at first i retin-a write an

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,960
email to their support support email

142
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,008
address right and what i get basically

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,960
is of course if you the result was

144
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,940
closure you don't start just by saying

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,370
okay this is a details right you start

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,990
by establishing proper contact so I'll

147
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,060
just write hey I found some security

148
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,870
issue I need to talk with someone and

149
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,699
what I got a couple couple days later is

150
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,710
well we're not sure you really found

151
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,940
anything and just just right just right

152
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,120
that's what you have to the support

153
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,190
email address so I bounce back and forth

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,830
and I'll try to get proper contact for

155
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,889
security so I get a feeling that they

156
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,599
don't really have a process in place

157
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:40,560
finally the same support email address I

158
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,550
do send out that well this is a general

159
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,500
description of what works

160
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,630
and we're gonna see it's on this level

161
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,060
here today even even you actually going

162
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,460
to go more technical than the email that

163
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,430
I sent to them and what I got back was

164
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,030
basically well thanks interested in

165
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,950
dealt with

166
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,770
I didn't even send them proof of concept

167
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,690
that even didn't even describe its on a

168
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,400
loved enough level but yeah it's dealt

169
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,140
with and then I tried to follow up and

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,760
what I got was all for obvious security

171
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,409
reasons it is our policy to never

172
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,890
discuss engineering matters bla bla bla

173
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,660
bla bla

174
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,550
we will not be commenting so I thought

175
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,670
okay it's been dealt with no no comment

176
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,980
sir just to be sure I I gave them a

177
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,460
couple of years and and now I'm in

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,230
Canada

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,409
I hope couple of years was enough to fix

180
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:27,660
it so there we go

181
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:31,260
okay let's look at the components so

182
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,510
this is this is one of the one of the

183
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,340
motherboards I call them the master

184
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,280
panel right it's a modular system all of

185
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,049
them sits for spectral series you well

186
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,549
usually how it goes is you don't buy

187
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,620
those you hire a security company and

188
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,820
they buy all those devices and come to

189
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,480
your home or office and set everything

190
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,750
up so this is the main brain of of the

191
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,610
system we also have some ancillary like

192
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,480
battery power supply siren and stuff

193
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,380
like that which is not really

194
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,550
interesting visually two wires does

195
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,630
transmit a lot of current don't want to

196
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,230
screw that then we have slaves on the

197
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,659
comm bus and these includes a wide array

198
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,230
of different things keypads of course I

199
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,230
have one right here

200
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,680
then modules including expansion modules

201
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,090
if you want to add something more that

202
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,300
you can add the original module let's

203
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,400
say you bought this cheap and spectra

204
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,990
device and you want something more you

205
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,250
you can buy expansion module and convert

206
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,810
it into something batteries there's a

207
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,660
printer module that's the one displayed

208
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,090
here you see a parallel port a serial

209
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,980
port and a USB port so you can connect

210
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,010
your printer even if it's more than one

211
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,010
blitzen modules which is kinda nice way

212
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,590
of saying spying on what people are

213
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,870
talking in your in your house so

214
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:49,310
different different tools that actually

215
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,650
use compass to communicate then we have

216
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,540
zone devices and all they do is they

217
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,980
provide input to the panel they simply

218
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,849
send an interim

219
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,570
in a very very simple simplistic way so

220
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:06,000
it's simply change of resistance on the

221
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,680
wire we have magnetic sensors that you

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,390
can start doors or windows we have a

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,010
passive infrared sensors that we can use

224
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,960
for movement detection we have panic

225
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,790
buttons and stuff like that so I think

226
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,090
there can be easily interrupted it's

227
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,640
only for input then we also have some

228
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:25,440
wiring available only for output so

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,590
programmable outputs and they can drive

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,090
up to one tenth of an ampere it's a

231
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,600
stall said Seoul says relay and we can

232
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,070
add like a light bulb like a fan or

233
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,570
close the door physically anything you

234
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,160
want and then finally there are serial

235
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,960
devices which you can connect the serial

236
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,550
port so we have serial converters so the

237
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,940
the port the protocol on serial port

238
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,229
here is rs-485 we have serial converters

239
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,360
to actually get it into something that

240
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,690
most computers can speak speak to you

241
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,720
like USB or rs-232 we have IP modules

242
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,030
which allows you to connect your your

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,160
great system online and then people can

244
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,010
access it via an IP address just ten

245
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,280
modules to do the same over the mobile

246
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,250
connection so that's a quick overview of

247
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,550
how the system works well not how it

248
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:28,080
works but the components let's go deeper

249
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:29,819
now so this is a 192 panel of the secure

250
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,590
series and the most advanced one

251
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,240
available that is the one I have here

252
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,920
reading today this is how it looks and

253
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,860
well what can we see here we have our

254
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,599
power right we have supply alternative

255
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,250
current sixteen point five volts we have

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,810
battery in case current goes down

257
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,770
because you know

258
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,380
burglars sometimes just cut off your

259
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,880
power and then they get in so of course

260
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,710
we need to have battery and we also have

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,620
a 3 volt battery so that you don't have

262
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,500
to reset the clock every time the panel

263
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,260
runs out of both the AC input and the DC

264
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,960
battery which is unlikely but there you

265
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,780
have it on many panels its actual isn't

266
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,630
it installed so then we have the compass

267
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,149
which is what this talk is about

268
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,519
combos consists of these four wires here

269
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,649
which is plus/minus green and yellow

270
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,389
this is how they're called and this one

271
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,459
is called service keypad which is

272
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:21,410
basically just the same four wires which

273
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,569
an installer can come to your house and

274
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,800
plug into your panel and and not have to

275
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,740
run between the panel where the

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,479
panelists and the keypad and we have

277
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,540
other reports as well already mentioned

278
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,120
we have a serial port right here we have

279
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,589
the mem keep word which I think we're in

280
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,940
some further investigation so this

281
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,810
basically a port where you plug in a

282
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,829
special let's call it a USB Drive but on

283
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,599
one side of the Drive you have

284
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,819
connectors that go in to enter this kind

285
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,380
of slot and it copies the configuration

286
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,880
or it writes the configuration from the

287
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,800
USB drive to the panel which is kind of

288
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,110
cool and then we have these two

289
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,920
connectors for voice dialer in case

290
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:07,339
someone still uses that so the reverse

291
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:10,430
of hearing process how did I do it so

292
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,319
tools I used is a logic analyzer well I

293
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,630
actually actually did did use an

294
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,130
oscilloscope at first so this is

295
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,970
simplified version but anyway what you

296
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,589
can do either and arena which is quite

297
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,779
quite Universal tool that you can use up

298
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:26,540
to a specific frequency of course

299
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,389
actually when I was reviewing my my

300
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,029
slides on the flight from Frankfurt to

301
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,490
to Toronto the lady sitting next to me

302
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,720
said oh or do you know I know that so I

303
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,759
was excited well you don't where do you

304
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:45,290
know how so and she was from Italy

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:50,269
apparently got some guy's name so this

306
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:52,910
is this is what I came up with I'm a

307
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:57,009
huge fan of networking leveling like DoD

308
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:59,420
model or I saw I saw model right and

309
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,009
this is what I came up with is probably

310
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,509
they have some internal documents where

311
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,980
they have their own layers these are my

312
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,130
layers which you're free to use of

313
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,949
course this is how I have a look at the

314
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,100
traffic to make it more recognizable

315
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:15,589
this is how combis is built on an

316
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,720
electrical level so we have a master

317
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,510
device which is the panel and then we

318
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,639
can have a number of slave devices

319
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,819
I don't recall the specific number it's

320
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,990
quite a lot it's three days I think so

321
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,570
that's it you can't have two master

322
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,779
devices that's a gist of the graphic on

323
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,940
the left here on the right so I was able

324
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,189
to divide combos into multiple multiple

325
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,540
layers of what's called encoding so

326
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,440
electrical when we look at the

327
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,079
electrical specs signal packet command

328
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,570
and payload now for those of you here or

329
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,560
at home who will try to use this

330
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,850
presentation to reverse engineer

331
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,699
something new I find it easier to well

332
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,470
to just look at the stuff first the next

333
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,689
slides are going to scrap that and this

334
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,459
I created later so for reference do to

335
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,190
go back to it it's hard to start with

336
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:08,060
creating this part and then then then

337
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:11,120
doing the next slides okay so let's look

338
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,060
at the electrical later then you see a

339
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,040
keypad on the right that's a keeper like

340
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,229
this if you turn it if you turn it

341
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,730
around you see on the back you'll see a

342
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,029
couple of connectors where you can

343
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,560
connect some wires and if it's an

344
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,180
installed system then you will see that

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
some of ours are connected at least the

346
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,670
first four ones yellow green black and

347
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,920
red and maybe the blue one as well

348
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:40,490
so PGM would not usually be connected

349
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:43,099
but it may be so the question is let's

350
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,050
say you are on an abandoned Island and

351
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,060
all you have is this nuclear reactor and

352
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,329
using how many instruments right so how

353
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,569
do you go and try to understand what's

354
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:55,160
happening there without using any dogs

355
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:57,800
so you look at the colors and those are

356
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,019
the actual labels used on the on the

357
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,790
device on the keypad right so it doesn't

358
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,019
really say what yellow or green is even

359
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,250
the black and red is said is plus or

360
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:09,920
minus on on the on the board right on

361
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,199
the panel from all in any case looking

362
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,430
just at the keypad we see there's this

363
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:17,599
wire coming in with four wires in here

364
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,339
and connecting somewhere so that's a

365
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,660
compass obviously for wire bus so we

366
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:27,339
have to look at those four wires so what

367
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,990
can we do then black is a good guess for

368
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,339
foreground right so we just find a

369
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,560
ground connection on the board somewhere

370
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:34,340
connect to black measure resistance in

371
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,989
case

372
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,340
we found the ground if not we try

373
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,410
different different one like yellow

374
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,170
green whatever until we find it so we

375
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,459
have ground so that's happening then

376
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,229
let's take a look at the red one which

377
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,140
is usually used for a providing power

378
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,170
right so we connect again our probes to

379
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,839
black and red and we measure the voltage

380
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:57,709
on there so there is stable DC voltage

381
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,210
there so red is a visible power so great

382
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,790
we shouldn't be connecting any sensitive

383
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,860
electronics to those we have yellow and

384
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,740
green remaining so we connect our probes

385
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,560
there and it's kind of fluctuating and

386
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:14,560
we don't see anything good so that's

387
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,459
when we need to go to the signal layer

388
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,140
because we did everything we could

389
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,410
electrically now we have to take a look

390
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,870
at the signal the graph on the bottom is

391
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,939
actually what you get when connecting

392
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,930
like digital signal and and leather-like

393
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,150
celaya for example and we can see from

394
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,560
here that the yellow which is on the

395
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:39,110
bottom is super symmetric it goes up and

396
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,380
down up and down down and the green one

397
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,750
on the top is not so by my experience

398
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,150
it's apparent that yellow is o'clock

399
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,880
which is provided by the panel and green

400
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,980
is is data because you can't really

401
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,950
encode too much data in in a signal like

402
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,310
that right you would well that would be

403
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,160
useless

404
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,770
so what else can we see from this step

405
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,890
here we have 40 milliseconds from here

406
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:08,030
to here between packet bursts so that's

407
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,230
gonna come of use and one clock cycle is

408
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,910
one millisecond which means

409
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,890
mathematically that signal is 1

410
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,929
kilohertz which we get again from here

411
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,030
if we zoom in a bit better we can

412
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,890
actually see that it is indeed 1

413
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,520
millisecond for the clock to go up down

414
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,939
and back and back to the start point so

415
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,470
that's a signal layer but we still need

416
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,210
to understand common coding works here i

417
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,970
zoomed in on one of the short packets

418
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,860
here from beginning to the end and the

419
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,030
question is what's there well the

420
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,310
easiest thing to do right

421
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,379
any person was a engineering background

422
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:46,340
or we're background in in computing

423
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:48,140
would of course see okay so if we take a

424
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,330
look here if clock is high

425
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,850
the yellow is a clock if clock is high

426
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,620
then data is always one so it doesn't

427
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,360
carry anything right we take this green

428
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,029
one it's always Green Green Green Green

429
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,129
Green every time the clock is high it's

430
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,710
it's one so it's probably redundant so

431
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,419
we just we just assumed that if clock is

432
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,600
load and that's data so when clock is

433
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:12,409
red zero then we have data on here so

434
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,360
red so okay we write it in that cell

435
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:16,669
that's how it looked like that is how it

436
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,320
looks like we get some info which

437
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:22,130
actually done bad this is actually an

438
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,230
actual command zero zero C 9 1 2 D 2 1

439
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,590
which is what we get if you convert it

440
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,500
to hex but the thing is we should have

441
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,418
two-way communications right we have a

442
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,370
keypad here it is connected to the comm

443
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,649
bus I mean it is showing what's

444
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,969
happening to the system right if fencing

445
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:42,649
is open any zones or if if there are any

446
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,549
troubles or alarms but at the same time

447
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,570
I can type stuff here and it should

448
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,418
communicate back to the panel so the

449
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:54,379
question is how is it happening and well

450
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:57,230
apparently something is missing here so

451
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:02,510
the correct answer after after looking

452
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:05,630
at it for an hour or two is that the

453
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,908
clock is actually used to discern

454
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,340
communication direction so when clock is

455
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,200
high slave is talking and when clock is

456
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,480
low master is talking right we had clock

457
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,200
is low here that's the Masters message

458
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,059
but clock is high is sliced message and

459
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,210
how it works on electrical level is that

460
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:25,970
slave pulls down the voltage to send one

461
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,220
so what we actually had here is for

462
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,779
these ones that is slave saying nothing

463
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,960
slave sending all zeros not

464
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:36,110
communicating at all so that's how it

465
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,120
works now we have master slave master

466
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,350
slave master slave here we have nothing

467
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,330
right and here at the beginning the

468
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,740
first byte first eight bits are not used

469
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,049
by the slave I don't know why probably

470
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,649
in case the cables really long so or the

471
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:51,769
system's super slow so the slave can get

472
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:53,590
ready to send their message so the card

473
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:57,250
were set up I have it set up right here

474
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:59,629
and how do I set it up to be able to

475
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:02,090
distinguish so so far I've been working

476
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,760
with logic analyzer meaning that I would

477
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,189
well need to write some funky script the

478
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,629
actual analyze that but I want to do it

479
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,520
properly I want to have software running

480
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:16,030
I want to do it in Python let's say so

481
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,740
this is the hardware setup that I

482
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,420
created for reading only it's not going

483
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,740
to be work because of how its set up not

484
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,690
going to not going to work for writing

485
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,000
but you can also do that and then you

486
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:30,170
can have any more fun so I have ground

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,460
connected to the black wire well

488
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,190
black wire connected to ground on my

489
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,900
Arduino green wire connected to pin 12

490
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,760
which is just the pin I chose and and

491
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,120
the yellow is connected to pin 8 and

492
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:46,580
yellow was of course the clock right so

493
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:48,320
and the signal is 12 volts so that's

494
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,990
something to keep in mind when choosing

495
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,280
the resistances right I have 5 volt or

496
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,570
Dino here so I add some resistors super

497
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,930
low one on the ground just to prevent

498
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:04,520
interference with the panel and and

499
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:09,440
higher ones on on the actual data and

500
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:14,990
clock wires and this is basically how it

501
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,880
goes this slide here just takes

502
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,580
everything I just talked about for the

503
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,250
last five minutes and put it put puts it

504
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,500
into a nice pseudo code right well clock

505
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,150
changes we wait 15 microseconds just in

506
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,280
case just in case the clock is a bit

507
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,230
ahead of the actual data right remember

508
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,960
it's 1 millisecond per clock cycle so we

509
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,310
wait 50 microseconds if clock is high we

510
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,430
save the new the new byte on data pin to

511
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,620
master and we shift master tis left so

512
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,110
we can actually save all the date there

513
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,300
if clock is low then we save the

514
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,490
inverted by it on the data pin to the

515
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,860
slave and in case it has been idle for

516
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,140
more than 2 milliseconds which is two

517
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,600
clock cycles then we check if we have

518
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,540
any data and if you have returned it via

519
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,120
USB and we reset the internal variables

520
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,860
that's it so super simple that's what I

521
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,179
kept running on this arena here and that

522
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:11,179
means I can actually use this you'll be

523
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:13,860
able to connect to this system now let's

524
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:20,159
take a look at packet structure

525
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:21,779
so there are three common lengths of the

526
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,980
packets but that's not all it really

527
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,529
depends on the command that you're

528
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,440
sending so one of the commands that you

529
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:31,140
can send is the result command where the

530
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,659
panel communicates back to a combo slave

531
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,210
device the result of the action

532
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,820
requested so the first byte from the

533
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,059
master is the command so there can be up

534
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,379
to 256 commands we have checksum right

535
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:48,000
here we can talk about that a bit later

536
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,769
and the last one is unused it's always

537
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,899
well with sometimes zeros it's sometimes

538
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:56,299
1f it's sometimes something strange I

539
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:59,070
guess it's some electrical electrical

540
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:02,490
problem there but it's not used by the

541
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,230
system so why is it wisely done then we

542
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,080
have a different command here which is

543
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,850
an event command and as you can see it's

544
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,879
shorter it still has a checksum here and

545
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,570
last one is unused and then we have this

546
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,149
super super short one which is hard beat

547
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,418
command and it's only four bytes it has

548
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:24,840
no checksum and for the slave then some

549
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,730
examples for the slave the first byte is

550
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,149
unused because I don't know why because

551
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,769
it's just waiting room so we have this

552
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:34,500
unused here and the first one is unused

553
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:39,029
there then we have channel requests so

554
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,970
the second bit from the right of the

555
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:43,380
second byte is set high that way the

556
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,679
device is on the bus know that the

557
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,610
device wants to transmit and then we

558
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,559
have a command again this is authorized

559
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,990
user commander enter enter code command

560
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,940
and we have some parameters there checks

561
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:02,610
in at the end and here is a different

562
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,049
command where it usually starts it

563
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,820
usually starts with this one right

564
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,168
if slave isn't communicate then you

565
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,269
start typing something you will see this

566
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,529
one which says I want to talk I got

567
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:13,230
nothing to say

568
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:16,019
so just request the channel for

569
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,370
themselves so those are some examples of

570
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:22,289
pack structures and checksum is super

571
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:26,879
easy adjust the sum of course modules

572
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,690
256 the important part is what is in the

573
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,910
sum so

574
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,850
the sum contains everything from the

575
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,680
orange bite up to before to green right

576
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:38,189
here so in this case it doesn't include

577
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,770
the zero two and zero zero in there in

578
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,520
case you want to look into that now

579
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:47,129
before we do the demo just do command

580
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:52,980
the command level and to actually show

581
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:56,130
you how they're built this is a

582
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:59,220
heartbeat or clock command it's code is

583
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,560
either C or D sometimes and then it has

584
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,330
a sequence number so every command every

585
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,129
unique command sent from the panel its

586
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,439
central panel by the way it's going to

587
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,450
have a sequence number from 0 to 255 and

588
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,660
then back to 0 and the last bit of the

589
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,790
sequence number will decide the payload

590
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,100
if it's gonna be day of the month an

591
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,700
hour or it's gonna be minutes and

592
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,490
seconds depending on the last bit now

593
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,320
command for code entry this is sent by

594
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:32,550
the keypad as you can see from zero zero

595
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:36,750
zero two at the beginning UT is user

596
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,620
type it is so the first bit if it's set

597
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,120
to one

598
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,070
it's a programmer if it's not set to one

599
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,290
it's normal user programmer is the guy

600
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,210
who comes to your house and they have

601
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,190
this six digit code instead of four

602
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,450
digit code that they can change all the

603
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:54,270
system our city is the code type nothing

604
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,700
much to say I think FF and 0 or 1 or 0 2

605
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,440
is what I've seen it depends on what

606
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,880
kind of code is being typed in so

607
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,930
programmer will have a different type of

608
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:07,680
code then we have the code itself I

609
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:09,900
think it allows up to 12 characters

610
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,390
there right in this case is the for

611
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,310
Carter code and then we have serial

612
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,710
number of source device so that tells me

613
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:19,919
we also have no proper identification of

614
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,360
the client you can just prove the serial

615
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,320
number and it also matches the actual

616
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,659
serial number on the device which is

617
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,620
cool and we have the checksum of course

618
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,300
as discussed previously

619
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,070
and so the payloads what did I

620
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,830
understand about the payloads there's no

621
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:39,540
encryption used so it's all in plain

622
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:41,280
text text is usually fixed length often

623
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,830
it's 16 characters

624
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,190
and it's filled by spaces right we can

625
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:54,060
see an example here this is a full full

626
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:58,350
packet oops it's a full packet we can

627
00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:00,720
see the that was a packet right we can

628
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,669
see the string starting here so it's

629
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,600
door one there is space

630
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:08,790
there is some numbers and more spaces so

631
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,469
this is a packet that is sent when

632
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,090
system boots up it actually sends all

633
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,310
the information about all the zones and

634
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,550
all the entity have on the panels so

635
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:20,159
that all the panels also know that and

636
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:24,300
numbers are usually packed binary coded

637
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,640
decimal so meaning if you want to send

638
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:31,830
let's say 11 instead of sending 0a you

639
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,350
send one one so in in hex and to

640
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,270
obfuscate it so zeros are in sent are

641
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,330
not sent as zeros but as a so that's

642
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,770
that's all the security they have so at

643
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,820
least we got application even though we

644
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:47,760
don't have encryption ok then let's do a

645
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,659
demo which is what some of you came here

646
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,370
for I guess right so the user manual the

647
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,020
one well in stellar manual the one

648
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,610
that's leaked online says that before

649
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,500
connecting a module to the compas remove

650
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,830
AC and battery power from the control

651
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,450
panel

652
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:09,120
well we don't have time for that so we

653
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:12,990
don't gonna do that right so I just

654
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,419
launched terminal application that

655
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,980
simply is reading what's on the wire and

656
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,960
we see a bunch of zeros we might see

657
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,100
some other data because the wires are

658
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,520
just dangling right now

659
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:27,060
and what an attacker or researcher may

660
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,980
do right so you have this keypad here if

661
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,139
I are going to keep at what you can do

662
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,520
is you can cut the wire open don't don't

663
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,950
disturb not disturbing anything you cut

664
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,360
the wire open you will see multiple

665
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,310
wires in this case it's more than four

666
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,449
but we know the color is used right and

667
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:45,060
you can try to remove isolation try to

668
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,320
remove the plastic from some of the

669
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,629
wires and then when you've done that you

670
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,980
can connect to the wires without serving

671
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,390
anything so let's try doing just that

672
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,390
I'll start with ground

673
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,480
so we were supposed to have a small

674
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,740
camera for this super small thing but we

675
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,930
don't sorry about that it's not gonna

676
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,690
take long so we connect the ground then

677
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:14,620
we can connect the clock which is a

678
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:19,720
yellow one and then we can connect the

679
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:22,060
data which is a green one right so we

680
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,460
see some data we actually see the

681
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:27,340
heartbeat packets right here and we see

682
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,460
the zeros that are going back from the

683
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:38,919
slaves okay so that's not fun to watch

684
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:43,690
let's let's try to interpret that if we

685
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:46,480
now launch the decoder we can actually

686
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:49,600
see the packets decoded right we can see

687
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,900
that one packet is sending the day of

688
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,480
bounds which is 2nd of November and then

689
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,560
a hour which is 16 which means I still

690
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,110
have around 15 minutes and the second

691
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,450
packet is actually sending our sort of

692
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,490
minute and and the second and we can see

693
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,670
the sequence number just rotated through

694
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:12,490
2055 to zero so well that's what's

695
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,920
happening there I will now remove these

696
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:19,000
filter I will now filter these packets

697
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:22,050
so that well so that we see what we

698
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,050
actually want to see right

699
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,380
now let me clear the screen okay so now

700
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:38,939
I've filtered this time packet ignore

701
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:45,000
the camara and now we can for example

702
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:47,160
let's say we open at the word right if

703
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,020
you open the door we see that a packet

704
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,710
was sent it's already coded here zone 1

705
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,360
is opened in area 1 CRC is ok there are

706
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,300
troubles currently on the system and

707
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,159
that's a timestamp of the event right we

708
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,680
have a movement for example on some

709
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,900
passive infrared sensor again zone is

710
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,440
open and then door gets closed and then

711
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,240
let's say passive infrared sensor also

712
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,780
registers no movement anymore so we can

713
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:18,480
decode that quite quite nicely and

714
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:20,430
innately ok now what happens if let's

715
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,970
say as we are connected here I type in a

716
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:30,810
code right let's say I want to arm the

717
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:32,910
system with code 1 2 3 4 ok so it's

718
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,560
showing me code denied over there we

719
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,780
also see the same here we see the serial

720
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,940
number which are I remove some symbols

721
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,610
from it we see the code entered and we

722
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,040
see the panel speaking back saying that

723
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,560
it was denied right if you knew the

724
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,450
right code we could of course say the

725
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,310
important part here is that attacker on

726
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,540
this position can not only see what's

727
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,490
being tapped on the keypad but also

728
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,180
hundred percent understand if the code

729
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,180
is correct or not

730
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:02,550
ok let's say that this keypad is

731
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,020
somewhere far away and no one uses it

732
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,250
just gathering dust right and no one

733
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,280
will ever come there

734
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,640
what happens if attacker sets up over

735
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:14,040
there and then real keypad is used

736
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,890
somewhere else so let's say there's a

737
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,940
real keypad here I'm gonna I'm gonna arm

738
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:23,480
the system with instant arm and it asks

739
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:31,580
me for my code I'm gonna enter the code

740
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:34,320
oops wrong code now there we go

741
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,179
now what happened is of course we see

742
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,629
that code is this and result was

743
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,779
accepted but all same words is because

744
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,419
of

745
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:44,190
Columbus's built this part here also

746
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:49,190
receives what we typing on different

747
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:52,529
keypad which is a huge thing I think and

748
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:56,580
well it's now arming I think it's it's

749
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:59,609
gonna take it's gonna take like 35 more

750
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,080
seconds to arm but one last thing I'm

751
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,999
gonna show when the demo is a remote

752
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,080
right they also make these remotes where

753
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,789
you can just press the button and you

754
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,129
don't have to enter any codes and you

755
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,690
can nicely control your your stuff from

756
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:12,330
away right I can press the info button

757
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,249
for example on the remote here and if I

758
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,228
press the info button on the remote it

759
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:17,849
also gets broadcast over this wired

760
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:20,279
compass even though it's not directly

761
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:21,928
connected to combos but just for the

762
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:25,379
panel so we can see that info button was

763
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:29,820
pressed on the remote which was sent out

764
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:33,718
by the sent out by by the slave and then

765
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,849
and then also confirmed by the panel and

766
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:38,879
we have an event here blah blah blah

767
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:41,039
okay what happened here arming finally

768
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:43,799
happened so one minute past arming

769
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,899
happens we see that arm arming was no

770
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,269
delay was used special our impartial so

771
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:50,488
it's partially armed and user for was

772
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:54,809
the one that armed the area now I can

773
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:58,019
just press this button here and these

774
00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:00,509
are disarmed the panel using a master

775
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:04,229
code looking into this would be fun

776
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:05,999
right looking at the radio codes for

777
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:07,889
this actually I think that might also

778
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:11,159
seeing what we see here that might also

779
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:12,929
bring us some interesting stuff okay so

780
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,659
that's the end for the demo we can

781
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:17,609
return it any questions in where we have

782
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,879
questions later on if you want let's

783
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,879
continue

784
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:44,799
so um this is what the red page said

785
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:50,230
this week yeah well I don't know what

786
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:55,179
what they mean by high security but okay

787
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:58,240
then some scenarios how can this be used

788
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,500
in fact of course you I hope all of you

789
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,479
noticed that this attack requires

790
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,549
physical access to combos right it's not

791
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,079
ready to attack

792
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:07,750
so one scenario I call the warehouse

793
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,569
attack this systems are also used in

794
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:14,559
warehouses large storage areas with this

795
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:16,299
multiple entry right I was I was going

796
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,900
to tell in which is capital of Estonia

797
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:23,140
in a neighboring country of Latvia once

798
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,089
and I had to choose a hotel and they had

799
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,879
this hotel that was used for the

800
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:30,369
Olympics couple tens of years ago and I

801
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,960
said well that's cool I could I it was

802
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,849
built it and only you just built for the

803
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,579
Olympics I'd love to stay in a Soviet

804
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,319
hotel no sarcasm because because I mean

805
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,809
laughing has moved quite quite quite

806
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:42,400
high up from Soviet times so I said well

807
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:43,630
I'd like to experience that so there's

808
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,670
just so much to tell everything is

809
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,740
expected but this huge is like one

810
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,470
kilometer in length and the entry is

811
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,029
only from one side so for buildings like

812
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,500
that usually have entries for multiple

813
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:57,640
sides and then we have keep us on all

814
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,529
the entries and well some of the key

815
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,960
parts tend to get abandoned let's say

816
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:04,269
there is a reconstruction going at one

817
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:09,700
of the ends and no one's going in there

818
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:12,038
or just let's say that parking was built

819
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,450
at one near one entry or near two of the

820
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:16,900
entries and third one is left untended

821
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:20,500
so attacker can easily pull this from

822
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,759
the wall connected wires and attach a

823
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,250
much small device on this you can

824
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:25,960
actually build it well not exactly in a

825
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,329
wire but quite small and leave it there

826
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,369
and then when a different keypad is used

827
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:36,039
somewhere else the attacker will still

828
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:39,160
get the right codes the second thing you

829
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,980
can do if you if you make sure that you

830
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,200
can actually write to the bus is you can

831
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,190
brute force the pinkos which is four

832
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,410
digits with

833
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,510
loketh configured but you can easily

834
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,808
brute force couple couple pins on our

835
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,470
right and again if you if you are in for

836
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,200
the long game

837
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,750
you can simply check out all the pins

838
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,640
and you can unlock it yourself so let's

839
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,460
say the system would say it's a secret

840
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,500
site that's as as they had said a

841
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,819
military secret military site that's

842
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,010
only used in case of Hoover no one's

843
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:16,029
there we connect it you do your stuff

844
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:19,869
and you get the code so in summary the

845
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,470
results I was able to build build the

846
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:25,180
hardware needed and the coding software

847
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,069
for that so it's gonna be published so

848
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,649
the implication here is that you will be

849
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:31,270
able to do that yourself you know we'll

850
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,900
take a look at that and I really hope

851
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:38,890
that this these problems are fixed and

852
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:42,609
and because this I deliberately tried to

853
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,589
get an old system for for the demo I

854
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:48,279
should actually buy a new one and see if

855
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:50,078
it's if it still works I hope I really

856
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,760
hope it doesn't but then again seeing

857
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,369
that they have not announced any

858
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,109
replacements for separates several parts

859
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:58,270
for separate parts of the system right

860
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,308
for keypads or or panels and they are

861
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,990
still interoperable in between I would

862
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:05,619
doubt that all update has actually been

863
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,000
pushed out the protocol is partial tests

864
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,670
transcribe you can actually see much

865
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,260
more than we saw in the demo they're

866
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:14,380
much old events we can see all the

867
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,270
events we can see different codes being

868
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,980
entered we can see a partitioning

869
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,319
happening when system boots up it takes

870
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,150
up like it takes like around one to

871
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:23,589
three minutes when system starts what's

872
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,559
actually happening is your panel is

873
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:28,210
communicating via combos to all the

874
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,520
devices and numerating them and then

875
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,200
sending back all the devices to all the

876
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,390
other devices so everyone knows what's

877
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,368
where and the system is built on such a

878
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,779
principle that every combos device has

879
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:42,400
memory that stores the information for

880
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:44,859
that particular boot up so it's not

881
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,930
rebroadcast every time for example the

882
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,029
year is Stewart when the system boots up

883
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,368
or or where the or when the data's

884
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:54,609
changed the same with combos components

885
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,349
right panel just informs all the keypads

886
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,269
and all the other devices and that's it

887
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:01,279
and they have to remember that so

888
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,508
is protocols professional described you

889
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:05,809
can take a look at it

890
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:07,130
mmm you can play with it you can work

891
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,779
with your own systems and you can

892
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,489
interface with them you can make

893
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,219
connections with different different

894
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:15,739
modules of your own when possible

895
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:18,380
attacks of course well all I can say is

896
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:19,809
I hope it's it's fixed right because

897
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,299
this is not radio attack but that's

898
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:28,309
coming probably coming in in in a year

899
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:30,649
or so Solutions I'd suggest so of course

900
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:34,339
first thing is encryption at the command

901
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:36,589
layer so you would need to encrypt the

902
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:41,229
comment layer you would you know that's

903
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:43,729
the basic thing for high security system

904
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:46,819
TLS might be used with the processing

905
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:50,959
power of today's communications which

906
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:53,359
also has an added advantage of enabling

907
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:55,629
nature slave master identification one

908
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:01,098
attack that I didn't talk about today is

909
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:03,259
the possibility to spoof a slave device

910
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:06,619
on kompis because all we have the serial

911
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:09,289
number right it's similar to network

912
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:10,459
layer and then in a classical network

913
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,259
right we have a MAC address we can

914
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:15,408
simply spoof it if that's all we have

915
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:18,199
and we see it it spoof it so that's that

916
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:19,789
was problematic so client certificates

917
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,049
might be used that's probably not the

918
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,959
best idea but I mean if this isn't

919
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:25,969
powerful enough we can go that way but

920
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,948
we still need mutual identification and

921
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:29,899
since the payload should be encrypted at

922
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:32,209
the payload levels so pin code should

923
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:34,159
not be sent you when you type seven zero

924
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:39,259
zero seven you should not see seven a a

925
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:41,989
seven on on the bus my idea for this is

926
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:43,669
unique per panel key so panel when

927
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:47,059
installed on installs it generates a key

928
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:48,649
or the key stepped in and all the

929
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:53,079
devices and stores are key permanently

930
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:55,759
and they can encrypt it or maybe they

931
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,179
maybe they just send the key out on

932
00:40:55,759 --> 00:41:01,009
panel boot up which happens quite rarely

933
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:02,359
so further research that we should look

934
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,799
into I will be looking into some of that

935
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,469
if you're interested in looking some of

936
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:09,019
that just don't do it find me on github

937
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,249
and then we can maybe cooperate or you

938
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:12,799
can do it on your own you don't have to

939
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:13,370
report to me or anything so articulation

940
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,690
protocol

941
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,950
is something I'd like to look into so

942
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,630
there are multiple devices on the comm

943
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,210
bus multiple slave devices what happens

944
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,250
if multiple devices want to send at the

945
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,080
same time so that's something I'm

946
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,780
interested in you know of service

947
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,700
attacks can we use combos to make the

948
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,830
panel not work at all that might be nice

949
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,740
we just come to a keypad we shut down

950
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,540
the panel and we're good

951
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,029
emulating a slave of course writing to

952
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,920
the bus would be important compossible

953
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:43,210
radio so remember those negative Megalon

954
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,800
panels they use radio frequencies and

955
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,020
keypad communicate via combos so I

956
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,910
haven't looked into it but my fear is

957
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,910
that well they just put two combos and

958
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,680
put it over RF that would be kind of bad

959
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,259
since they don't encrypt it at least

960
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,480
here then RF attacks which I already

961
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:03,440
mentioned right we have these remotes

962
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,590
which might be used to the start of the

963
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,660
system maybe there are some calls there

964
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:11,980
and firmware reverse engineering is

965
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:17,600
another topic which is something I

966
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:19,520
mastered on professional level only only

967
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,810
in the reason here and I'd like to dump

968
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,070
the firmware and take a look at what's

969
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,799
in there and actually take a look at the

970
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,110
instructions and an opcode sensor and of

971
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,230
course we have to think about logo

972
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:35,180
before for that so I think we need one I

973
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:38,600
created one maybe it works right

974
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,180
so with that resources here are the

975
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,490
addresses and the respective dates when

976
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,919
stuff will be available our slides will

977
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,629
be available today but I don't I don't

978
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,550
have access to my stuff from here so

979
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,610
I'll be back and then I'll upload the

980
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,560
slides and tools will be also available
