material like I said and I wasn't

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,240
actually intending on speaking here this

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,820
year I didn't have anything ready for

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,229
this most of my research I've been doing

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,939
in the past year my last company is all

27
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,340
under NDA and I couldn't really talk

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,479
about it publicly and then Patrick hit

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,610
me up and he said hey I noticed you

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,770
didn't submit anything for hex Fest this

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,179
year it's what's going on we kind of

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,920
need those semi English speakers and I

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,540
said ah you know I told him I didn't

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,909
really have anything prepared so I was

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,170
just gonna skip it this year and he said

36
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,850
Huawei you're working on something

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,079
anything maybe and I said well I've been

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,820
playing around with scraping this venmo

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,460
public feet and he goes oh I was hoping

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,100
someone would talk about that get it in

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,110
I said oh I don't I don't have it I

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,850
don't really have it you know anything

43
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,060

bypass our automated tool defense

systems we're really cool if you work

59

for a company that needs to defend

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,080
against scrapers botnets scalpers

61
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,970
anything of that nature pretty much any

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,489
kind of a lot of made a tool system be

63

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,329
you've got in my kind of general way

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,988
that I worked my way up through security

69
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,579
over the past 12 plus years started as a

70
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,470
network engineer made way all the way

71
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,760
through penetration testing my last

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,819
position I was industrial security

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,530
researcher which was really cool and sad

74
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,230
and terrifying and I don't recommend

75
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,090
anyone to it and now this is what I'm

76
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,280

people get the word out and I post all

83
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,200
my code and slide decks and things like

84
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,030
that to the Twitter so that's a great

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,589
place to keep an eye on me I'm gonna go

86
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,359
through a script that I wrote for this

87
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,840
whole thing later that script is gonna

88
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,530
be on my github which is down here how

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,389
cool is this

90
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:39,180
I just love this thing so alright this

91
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,040
is a very like nutrient-dense talk so

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,359
I'm gonna race through this to try and

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,620
bear with me feel free to take pictures

94
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,470
any of the slides formation while later

95
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,000
I was working with an application here

96
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,010
called venmo it's a mobile payment app

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,720
that's extremely popular in the US and

98
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,099
it wasn't until about four days ago that

99
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I realized it doesn't exist in Canada

100
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,119
and no one here is gonna have any idea

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,919
what the hell I'm talking about so I

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,780
threw some slides together to tell you

103
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,639
guys how big of a deal this thing is

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,849
keep bear in mind through this entire

105
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,329
thing this is US only so about 23

106
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:13,649
million users in this active users in

107
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:16,168
2018 it is the most used mobile payment

108
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,970
application by Millennials specifically

109
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,130
and we're gonna find out why that is in

110
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,019
a couple of minutes it's actively

111
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,300
accepted at retailers both

112
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,770
brick-and-mortar and online by about two

113
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,770
million of them it's a huge huge huge

114
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,120
mobile payment app

115
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,099
why do we need another mobile payment

116
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,570
app we've got you know PayPal we've got

117
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,610
all of the banking apps we've got Apple

118
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,360
pay we've got Google Wallet how the heck

119
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,000
did venmo expect to get into this market

120
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,610
they did it with social engineering and

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,950
cartoons this concept of getting people

122
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,320
to pay you money if they owe you money

123
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,180
is always an awkward situation and if

124
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,650
you use something as basic as like hay

125
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,720
splitting a pizza or like I'll pick up

126
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,219
dinner and you can pay me back later and

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,120
then a week goes by and they've never

128
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,710
paid you it's always an awkward

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,980
conversation to have

130
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,229
then they'll fix to this by having a

131
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,320
communication mechanism built into the

132
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,690
app that is like super emoji intensive

133
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,640
to the extent that when you're typing

134
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,860
within the text boxes in the app itself

135
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,930
it will recommend emoji for you to use

136
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,990
not just based on your own like keyboard

137
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,360
emoji recommendations and so they turn

138
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,180
something into hey man where's my 20

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,680
bucks into fun little emoji and then

140
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,760
everybody's happy and cutesy and then

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,610
they kick you the twenty bucks and you

142
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,140
get paid and also this of course

143
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,040
devolved into great ways to pay your

144
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,500
drug dealers and we're gonna we're gonna

145
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,600
talk a lot about that and so yeah they

146
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,040
got to they busted their way into the

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,020
mobile payment market by just being

148
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,370
cutesy and fun and making it way less

149
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,380
awkward to get money from people here's

150
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,660
their payment volume as of q3 seventeen

151
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,090
and a half billion dollars have been

152
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,760
transferred through venmo seventeen and

153
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,320
a half billion and increasing by about

154
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,450
the same amount quarter after quarter

155
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,530
after quarter was starting in q1 2017

156
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,789
then there for those of you can't read

157
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,190
that it's the number four most used p2p

158
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,260
payment app this is particularly

159
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,680
interesting to me because we've got you

160
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,690
know venmo down here number four bank

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,120
banking apps all banking apps combined

162
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,890
and that's your general banks like Chase

163
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,290
and your Bank of America and whatever

164
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,760
the heck you have up here all those

165
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,470
combined above end up at number three

166
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,710
but I thought it was really weird that

167
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:34,950
facebook Messenger is the number one

168
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:36,840
most used mobile payment app I don't get

169
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,849
it maybe for the same reason that venmo

170
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,859
got popular you can be super cutesy and

171
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,440
send emojis to the facebook Messenger

172
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,970
but there it is so yeah everyone likes

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,000
statistics right this is fun you guys

174
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,960
want me to do like 60 more slides of

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,349
financials and Venom or do you want me

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,638
to get to the hookers and blow

177
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:58,800
let's I know what you want so we're

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,400
talking about the API that exists in

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,870
here the API and I can show you guys in

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
fact that's what I'll do

181
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,069
it's easily accessible through a web

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
browser which is really cool except that

183
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,500
it has a whole lot of limitations in it

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,679
let me see how I can do this this way

185
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,699
yeah

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,379
Oh actually you know what I'm gonna show

187
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,900
you guys what that looks like - so this

188
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,719
is it for you guys who haven't used memo

189
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,159
before anyone from the US here let me

190
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,740
just get like a yeah it's a real small

191
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:31,800
number have you guys use anyone used

192
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:35,210
memo alright cool so so venom Oh hit hit

193
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,639
the media in in the summer last year

194
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:41,039
when Vice and a few others discovered

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,710
that there's this public feed over here

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,289
see these are your feeds you got friends

197
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,599
mine public I disabled my internet and I

198
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,080
totally broke this entire talk now sorry

199
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:54,240
guys

200
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,740
you see if I fix this for you okay so

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
there's a public feed that goes on and

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,940
everyone freaked out because by default

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,909
when you sign up for an account and you

204
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,460
make any payments this public fee it

205
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,169
posted this public feed and that that

206
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,440
was crazy to people and I'm not gonna

207
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:17,669
sign it for you this is time we don't

208
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:21,120
have right ding okay so here's our

209
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,279
public feed let's check this out I don't

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,669
know any of these people and these are

211
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,669
people paying other people for serum

212
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:36,240
well a whole lot of bread more bread and

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,459
so this is this became very interesting

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,110
because you see terms like bread come up

215
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,909
a lot and you go in there well what well

216
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,480
I know so many people talking about

217
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,699
bread you see food you see pizza a lot

218
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,420
and I'll show you some stats later when

219
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:53,949
I was able to do some searching and it

220
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:58,889
this this is fascinating you can

221
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:02,260
scroll through this forever and H

222
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:05,829
Halloween denden curtain yeah this is

223
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:10,060
probably you know haircut and women yeah

224
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,560
so uh it gets weird so that's that's

225
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,969
what the public feed looks like and this

226
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,319
has been like this forever since venimos

227
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,180
inception that was its whole thing of

228
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,100
making a social aspect out of

229
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,589
transferring money making giving money

230
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,930
passing money around fun with your

231
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,760
friends and so they got called out on

232
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,079
this public feed and just displaying

233
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,230
everything that you're spending money on

234
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:31,449
to the entire world really easily

235
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,019
allowing things like I can see how much

236
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:37,529
you're paying for utility bills and I

237
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,550
won't get into that but we don't want

238
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,260
people to see what we're spending money

239
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,399
on you know it's one thing to like be

240
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,139
transferring money to friends but you

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,490
got to remember you can pay like I said

242
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,930
utility bills with this you can buy

243
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,430
things online with this and a lot of

244
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,099
those online retailers and in the

245
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,959
brick-and-mortar retailers post that

246
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,519
information to the public feed some of

247
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,380
them literally post like exactly what

248
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,550
you bought they'll take the text from

249
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,459
your receipt throw it in this public

250
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,260
feed and I know everyone in this room is

251
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,209
kind of a privacy advocate but how many

252
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,310
people we do we know that don't

253
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:08,529
understand that social media and things

254
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,989
like that are publicly accessible by

255
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,430
default and what that means you know

256
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,899
public doesn't mean oh just to the

257
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,670
general people that I know but to the

258
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:20,290
entire world including somebody who may

259
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:22,390
be trying to build a personal framework

260
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,329
about me in order to blackmail me for

261
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,490
something later stalk me if they see oh

262
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:29,469
I get coffee at the same place every

263
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,600
Tuesday and Thursday on my way somewhere

264
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,579
they can wait for me there for some

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,980
reason things like that it's super

266
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,390
creepy and it's not like thrown in your

267
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,740
face that there's a problem with

268
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,640
something being public it's just like

269
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,870
you're aware that there's this public

270
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,980
feed ven Mo's stance on it is that's how

271
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,060
we operate and that's one of our big

272
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,190
things we're going to keep doing it

273
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,060
unless our users get super uppity about

274
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,279
it and so far they haven't

275
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:57,459
in the meantime venmo has a couple of

276
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,510
api's i was able to discover the fact

277
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:00,670
that there's two of them it was

278
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,740
particularly interesting and they have

279
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,779
some very slight annoyances to them and

280
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,209
I think I'll just skip right over to it

281
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,999
you can't like it says here you can't

282
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,768
just you

283
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,809
you can't just W get this you're gonna

284
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,979
get locked out depending on which API

285
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,839
you're using you get locked out

286
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,649
immediately you get one request and then

287
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,959
you're done

288
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,309
which seems bad for an API and I was

289
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,108
trying to figure out why that is and I'm

290
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,608
gonna we're gonna play along and get the

291
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:24,799
play-by-play and eventually figure out

292
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:26,149
why that is so there's the two ApS I was

293
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,549
able discover appear to be like a

294
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:32,929
version one and a version five the

295
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:34,339
version one appears to be and by keep in

296
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,779
mind I had no contact with ml through

297
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,549
any of this so I head in for everything

298
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,869
based on research and just poking at

299
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,459
things a lot of making some educated

300
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:41,809
guesses version one appears to be an app

301
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:46,039
developer API that they've since

302
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:46,519
discontinued around 2016 but is still

303
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,799
open

304
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,359
facing the internet and responding to

305
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,759
requests they may have done this because

306
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:55,249
old apps still exist and they want to be

307
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,739
able to allow those customers to still

308
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:59,149
be supported but it's been a while and

309
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:01,309
you think they would have maybe rolled

310
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,519
them all off of there by now but no it's

311
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:06,829
still out there it does do a lot of

312
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,679
really intense throttling however I

313
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,569
noticed if you go into the developer

314
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,069
site which still exists and request an

315
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:17,539
API access token which still exists that

316
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,098
throttling goes way down if you submit

317
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,229
that you know API request token with

318
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:24,109
every API request makes total sense very

319
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:25,579
normal situation getting that API token

320
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,959
through the normal web browser interface

321
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,439
I'll show you that in a minute is

322
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,728
annoying it's a lot of clicking and

323
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:33,319
responding to two-factor requests and

324
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,729
refreshing pages and if you get locked

325
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,649
out you have to wait a long time and

326
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:38,839
it's just an awful experience so if

327
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:41,089
you're trying to scrape an ocean of data

328
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,499
like I was trying to do you're still

329
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:44,629
getting locked out even with this API

330
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,549
token and you have this delay of minutes

331
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:48,229
two hours depending on what you're up to

332
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:51,858
before you can start again and it just

333
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:54,470
runs it renders the whole process awful

334
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:58,009
I found a beta API for the v1 and like

335
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,389
the the beta like dev API still appears

336
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:02,509
to be facing the Internet as well which

337
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:05,299
seems super weird to me and then I think

338
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,429
for for this one the worst part of it is

339
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:10,608
it uses this snowflake anyone familiar

340
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:12,949
with Twitter's snowflake trend IDs the

341
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:15,679
snowflake system I'll talk more about

342
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:17,659
that later it makes actually trying to

343
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,550
get chronological lists of data from the

344
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:28,910
public feeds super-annoying so

345
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:30,979
be one opposed to b5 here d5 does not

346
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,589
appear to care about API tokens I'm

347
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,959
pretty sure d5 is what the actual venmo

348
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,459
app uses so they have something in place

349
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,779
detecting if you use in the app or not

350
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,130
and if you're not it's just it'll give

351
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,880
you one response and then you're just

352
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,880
absolutely dead

353
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:48,770
this was interesting it uses epoch time

354
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,680
for pagination and that's always weird

355
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,589
when you come across it you can see that

356
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,579
up here like on this is an epoch it took

357
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,140
me a minute to figure that out because

358
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,149
it's not a transaction ID and I was like

359
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,439
well what are they doing here and then

360
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,839
someone had pointed out like is that

361
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:09,140
epoch time and I said you're a nerd and

362
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,339
and and I think you're right and sure

363
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,199
enough it is so like for some reason

364
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,670
they're using epoch time and the v5 and

365
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,130
it actually turns out I think that has

366
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,240
something to do with the snowflake

367
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:24,920
pagination I was talking about earlier

368
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:27,020
but I'm not sure that's the one cool

369
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,810
thing I found out about the the v5 here

370
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,670
is that I can abuse and off a certain

371
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,859
authorization section of it to get API

372
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,689
tokens on the fly even though the v5

373
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,180
doesn't use API token to care about them

374
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,589
there's a weird delivery mechanism of

375
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,029
them inside of it that I think is

376
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,310
accidental or unused

377
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,570
and then you can bounce that off of a v1

378
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,810
and I'll get through all this in a

379
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:56,500
second so don't worry about it

380
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:59,060
so if you're using the old v1 API venmo

381
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,550
thinks that's weird because it is

382
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,010
because almost no one is using it I my

383
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,109
account is still actually frozen so

384
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,689
don't use your personal account you're

385
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,490
not going to be able to get your money

386
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,310
or don't put money in that personal

387
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,380
account this is some some interesting

388
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,569
conversations that they had sent to me I

389
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,520
had only realized recently that I said

390
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,839
hey reset your password and then email

391
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,540
us back and then we'll talk about

392
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,709
unfreezing your account I've done that

393
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,209
and they have not gotten back to me

394
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,849
about the talk about in freezing your

395
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,579
account part yet I don't have my money

396
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,699
so make sure you're aware of what you're

397
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,699
doing

398
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,600
if you want to get a new a new account

399
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,390
created in order to just constantly make

400
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,370
new accounts and ping the API that way

401
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,050
just spin up a bunch of IPs make a ton

402
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,000
of new accounts and then just request

403
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,229
until the API locks you out and then

404
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,200
call it a day and get new accounts

405
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,940
that's really hard because you have to

406
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,550
go through several clicks and it makes

407
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,310
you confirm your identity via SMS

408
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,680
two-factor and it verifies that you're

409
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,119
using a real phone number which sucks

410
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,770
too if you don't have like a huge list

411
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,700
of real phone numbers or can all these

412
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,140
guess at that

413
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,460
so again super super gets in your way if

414
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,560
you're trying to dump an ocean of data

415
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,180
you constantly get blacklisted so they

416
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,540
have a lot of controls in place that

417
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,120
we're making this very difficult so it's

418
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,010
looking like maybe the whole public

419
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,510
getting uppity about oh people can dump

420
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,800
an entire year's worth of data from the

421
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,080
public feed and see what I've been doing

422
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,729
everywhere is kind of unfounded I could

423
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,860
not find a way to do it so I was like

424
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,940
okay I spent like two weeks on this and

425
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,650
I said well this isn't getting anywhere

426
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,980
PayPal who owns then it's a bug bounty

427
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,350
hey let me try to see what goes on there

428
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,150
see if I could find anything and I just

429
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,650
completely gave up on I'm scraping the

430
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,699
API at that point I said all right cool

431
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,660
you guys are doing something good I

432
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,070
guess what else is going wrong so this

433
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,630
is the token generation page this is

434
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,980
where you go to get your API token it's

435
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,590
hidden down and like this developer

436
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,090
section which is it's it's weird that it

437
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,550
exists because they're not accepting new

438
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,470
applications from developers you're not

439
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,938
allowed to create your own apps anymore

440
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,589
there's no reason for this to still

441
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,100
exist there's no reason for it to still

442
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,198
issue access tokens to you but it does

443
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:17,659
but it's uh first off to say at this

444
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,069
token lasts about 30 minutes and then it

445
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,449
blacklist itself when you have to come

446
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,899
back here and you have to reapply for a

447
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,540
new one by that point you your login

448
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,949
session is timed out so you have to

449
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,540
re-authenticate do your two-factor

450
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,680
request a new token get that Tok and

451
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,540
plug it back into your script or

452
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,190
whatever using to try and dump the API

453
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,810
and then either you're gonna get

454
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,950
blacklisted again in 30 minutes or

455
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,300
you're gonna do something dumb and it's

456
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,290
gonna blacklist you before that and you

457
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,990
have to come back here and do all this

458
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,000
again super annoying but I'm just

459
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,140
looking for bugs now in this page and I

460
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,140
was like oh wait a minute

461
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:55,170
this I'm glad you guys know what that is

462
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:59,610
what do we call this when the thing up

463
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,890
here looks like the thing down here now

464
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,860
we could we call it reflected cross-site

465
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,540
scripting and basically means anything

466
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,070
you stick in that URL bar appears on the

467
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,350
page and so you can do some really fun

468
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,629
stuff like this so I can craft like

469
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,669
probably custom you know more obfuscated

470
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,080
URL send it off to like an own vin mow

471
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,170
user where I think is trying to use the

472
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,820
dev portal at least and say hey there

473
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,980
you go paste this malicious link into

474
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,540
your browser and they do at least escape

475
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,710
HTML tags and things like that so I

476
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,710
can't throw a link right in there but

477
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,390
this looks pretty legit right like for

478
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,430
security purposes okay that makes sense

479
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,870
that I have to do something odd and like

480
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,030
one of the first things we're told you

481
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,320
know for you know avoiding email

482
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,030
phishing and stuff is like don't click

483
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,010
the links copy and paste it into a new

484
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,629
browser window so this is kind of like

485
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,430
very expected user behavior this isn't

486
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,080
asking someone to do something odd but

487
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,140
PayPal thought that that was just

488
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,520
completely off the wall long story short

489
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,290
this is them turning down my bug Boni

490
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,940
for that one cuz they said oh no that's

491
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,730
that's bizarre that no user whatever

492
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,080
fall for that that's ridiculous

493
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,600
okay so there you guys go you can have

494
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:08,370
that one that's PayPal doesn't give a

495
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:10,199
 so it's yours now side from that I

496
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,489
was like alright well you pretty much

497
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,680
look at all the pages that kind of have

498
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,760
interactive input my mouse here so I

499
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,340
could stop this so what i'm doing here

500
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,740
is uh I'm just signing up for a new

501
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,419
account I'm using crap data I'm using a

502
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,280
phone number that has an own area code

503
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,110
and prefix that I know is gonna be valid

504
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,310
and then I'm just trying random last

505
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,149
fours until I get one that hasn't

506
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,590
already been plugged into the system and

507
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,350
just using Chrome inspect here to see

508
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,820
what comes back and so here I'm at the

509
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,439
part where you have to confirm your

510
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,090
identity so like it doesn't create a new

511
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,590
count until you've definitely confirmed

512
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,699
that you own the phone number that

513
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,330
you're saying here right this is all

514
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,680
very normal we see this all the time

515
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:50,490
looking at the responses that I get back

516
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,720
here and I have anybody see that I know

517
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,880
that's really tiny up here I'm going to

518
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,600
call this out so so bear in mind here

519
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,840
this is I haven't confirmed this account

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
yet

521
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:08,759
and yet we're looking at an API access

522
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:11,158
token in a response header so nowhere on

523
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,099
the page but for some reason this server

524
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,690
shoots us back an API access token for

525
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,389
an average user just trying to create a

526
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,709
new account and that might end up being

527
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:21,449
used towards the app or something like

528
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,799
that the app when you log in probably

529
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,299
inherits that and punches that into

530
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,989
itself in the backend and that's the

531
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:31,529
like one that doesn't expire but we've

532
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:34,320
got a problem here because I have

533
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:36,299
shortened of the time it takes to start

534
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,939
up a new account and get that API access

535
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,440
token by an exceptional amount of time

536
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,029
because I don't have to go through the

537
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:48,269
rest of this crap and there it is so

538
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:50,849
yeah with in effect essentially

539
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,659
submitting a single form in a script I

540
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:56,939
can get API access tokens we're back in

541
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:59,759
let's uh let's write a script so I wrote

542
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,149
a script and I'm gonna give this script

543
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:05,070
to you guys so you can have all the fun

544
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:07,978
that I was having because I haven't had

545
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,178
a ton of time to actually gather oceans

546
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:11,339
of data because they actually still

547
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,669
takes an immense amount of time it it

548
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,408
for even with the gargantuan number of

549
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,629
servers I spun up to start scraping this

550
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,849
using this method I still was not able

551
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:23,189
to scrape data as fast as it comes into

552
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,049
venmo so if you want to scrape and then

553
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,190
even going backwards it was taking me

554
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,049
longer than the amount of time I was

555
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,369
scraping for ie if I wanted to scrape a

556
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,979
month's worth it would take me about

557
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,629
five weeks and that's insane

558
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,609
that's an insane amount of data so I was

559
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:39,228
able to get about six weeks of data from

560
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:42,418
this IP from from this API and it was

561
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:44,579
it's about three gigs worth but it's all

562
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,469
JSON it's an immense amount of items I

563
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,299
have to still build out like a Cassandra

564
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:50,249
cluster just to be able to do some good

565
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,459
correlation correlation attribution but

566
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:55,109
anyway here's the script hope you guys

567
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:56,429
can see this I'll only go for the

568
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:57,958
interesting parts I'm not gonna read you

569
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:02,279
my code line by line because I know you

570
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:03,719
love that at cons it's just really funny

571
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,190
so I wanted to point some things out

572
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:10,049
here so your variables up here you're I

573
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,669
asked for the last four digits of a

574
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:13,860
telephone line that's where it starts

575
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:16,140
and then if that one already has

576
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,928
an account associated with it it just

577
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,130
increments by one your before IDs and

578
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,720
after ideas we just have to do with

579
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,070
where you want to start within the

580
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,520
timeline and you can figure out where to

581
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,770
start and stop based on just punching

582
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,010
the initial IEP I write in your browser

583
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,620
and just looking for these and this is

584
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:38,610
your it's pretty obvious I'm not gonna

585
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,260
read this to you guys but yeah so all of

586
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,549
this is random random username random

587
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,540
password doesn't matter you never have

588
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,620
to use it again so you don't even have

589
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,299
to store these because all we're trying

590
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,790
to do is create a new account get the IP

591
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,250
API token and get to work cuz you don't

592
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,350
need credentials to hit the API you just

593
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,299
need this token and you're done so you

594
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,070
don't have to store any of this there's

595
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,110
a weird client ID that's required and

596
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,790
they're in the post headers don't know

597
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,659
what it does usually it's ten so I just

598
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,580
use 10 all the time play around with it

599
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,530
see see what you get I definitely found

600
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,210
that one ten and twenty eight nine eight

601
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,290
twenty and 99 are all valid but I don't

602
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,760
I didn't seem to get any different

603
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,280
responses based on those but I don't

604
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,140
know that's a fun thing you guys can do

605
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,760
the there's more telephone lines so yeah

606
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,049
this is all just garbage for this is me

607
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,669
submitting the form that you were

608
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:27,389
looking at before that gets right before

609
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:32,040
the account confirmation I so I did

610
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,000
notice this is this is great here's the

611
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,649
part of it here where just starts

612
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,049
incrementing the telephone line if it

613
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,540
fails to get anything if you try to use

614
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,710
the same phone number twice even after

615
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,659
it was successful the first time you

616
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,220
didn't confirm the account it still

617
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,240
marks that phone number is having an

618
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,120
account so by doing this we are

619
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,620
effectively blacklisting an ocean of

620
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,479
potential venmo users so far I haven't

621
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,360
found that that list gets cleared out

622
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,549
ever yet because I have to keep coming

623
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,080
up with like new ranges of telephone

624
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,470
numbers that are valid so sorry not

625
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,040
sorry

626
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,690
that's I I don't know what to tell you

627
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,100
that's not that's not my fault but it's

628
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,100
kind of my fault

629
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:20,309
I've probably blocked out a couple

630
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,719
thousand people maybe more in the

631
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:23,720
Chicago area code area

632
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,459
yet then it just gets a new API token

633
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,590
and someone appoint this out here it's

634
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,690
using the v5 where's my there's my good

635
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:38,820
one we're using the v5 API to do account

636
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,410
creation which like I said I'm pretty

637
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,169
sure is the one the official venmo

638
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,120
application uses but then because v5

639
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:47,700
doesn't actually seem to care about that

640
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,500
API token for some reason or I just

641
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,480
don't know how to submit it in a way

642
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,340
that it expects because these are

643
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,590
undocumented api's this is me trying to

644
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,699
reverse something over you know at

645
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:03,270
nights and weekends and I'm bored

646
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,190
if we feed it to the v1 API which seems

647
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,050
to love it that's really weird too that

648
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,800
like tokens from one API working for a

649
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,270
really old one

650
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,440
maybe not weird I don't know if it's

651
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:15,540
what's going on I like to add a few HTTP

652
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,850
headers in when I do stuff like this

653
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,430
just to try and make it look more

654
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,280
legitimate there's even more I could add

655
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,020
in there I like to get drop the cache

656
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,230
control down to zero just to be to make

657
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,540
sure I'm getting fresh data and the DNC

658
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,010
just sometimes dumps a lot of the

659
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,830
treking cookies which makes it harder

660
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,240
from the determine if you're pod or not

661
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,710
if you really want to dodge bot

662
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,960
detection and this is in general not

663
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,910
just with the venmo api but if you're

664
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,160
scripting something and you're pinging

665
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,890
web servers and you're trying to avoid

666
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,720
Akamai or distill or whoever discovering

667
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,280
that you're using automated tools and

668
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,370
you're not an actual human being one of

669
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,450
the best things you can do is this one

670
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:58,620
just still hates this one weird trick

671
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:00,510
you randomized these headers randomize

672
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,669
the order that you submit the HTTP

673
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,800
headers in and then if you want to get

674
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,150
really funny randomize the data that's

675
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,649
inside of them as long as you can

676
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,870
validate that the data you're providing

677
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,580
is still accepted by the web server but

678
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,649
I found in a ton of cases and we're

679
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,199
talking it's you know companies as big

680
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,020
as Akamai simply randomizing the order

681
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,320
in which you submit HTTP headers will

682
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,060
eliminate the detection systems ability

683
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,290
to think that you're a bot because it

684
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,550
thinks you're something completely new

685
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,800
because the headers came in a date for

686
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,409
an order and that's impossible to do

687
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,240
right like enough how do you how can you

688
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,460
randomize the order of HTTP headers

689
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,890
that's that's bananas

690
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,200
so yeah protip if you want to bypass a

691
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,210
light frame if your companies are

692
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,340
using bot detection mechanisms in front

693
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,610
of your web servers just try that if you

694
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,080
want to prove that they don't work and

695
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,629
then call me at casada and i'll come

696
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,100
take care of it because we don't fall

697
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:57,590
for that garbage we've begun this just

698
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,379
reads all the feed determines if you got

699
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,639
a good request or not in the the api's

700
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,710
are really cool and that they give you

701
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,789
like solid HTTP responses based on

702
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:09,049
what's going on you're either gonna get

703
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:11,120
a 429 are you gonna get 200 and that's

704
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,820
it and if kids are 429 it just Waits

705
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,250
goes gets a new token tries again gets a

706
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,510
202 dumps the data into wherever and

707
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,950
you're done so that's the whole script

708
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,450
I'm not gonna walk you through like line

709
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,370
by line that's what it does this will be

710
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,429
up on my github either tonight or

711
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,709
tomorrow and you guys can throw it on a

712
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:28,460
trillion AWS servers and play with it

713
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,049
and see what you find

714
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,970
we'll find some stuff in a little bit

715
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,350
please do and like if you find some cool

716
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,450
stuff let me know we'll talk about it I

717
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,830
had a blast just sitting down here last

718
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,690
night with a bunch of people going

719
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,689
through our findings going with this

720
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,929
mean and I'll put those up later because

721
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,039
I know that's why you guys are here all

722
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,730
right let's get let's get out of this

723
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,129
and go back to what I was doing

724
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,990
yeah so we wrote our script we started

725
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,940
firing away I am dumping the crap out of

726
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,740
ammo api's fast as I possibly can right

727
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,039
and everything's just going super smooth

728
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,260
except that it's really not this

729
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,419
snowflake distribution massive mechanism

730
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,460
that I'm pretty positive the API

731
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,429
well not the API but actual venmo uses

732
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,919
is a means of generating tens of

733
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,559
thousands of transaction ID numbers on

734
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,360
the fly and making sure that they're

735
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,059
unique yet still being able to

736
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,949
distribute them in a highly available

737
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,250
mechanism across all of the multiple

738
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:28,639
nodes that Venn known Twitter whoever

739
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,950
uses so basically if a request you know

740
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:32,750
a new transaction posts to a single node

741
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,909
because that's how it works that node

742
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,710
has to have a transaction ID that it can

743
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,480
assign to that transaction immediately

744
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,490
and know that the transaction ID it has

745
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,539
is not going to be used by any other

746
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,399
node in the cluster

747
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,779
because it has to be able to do that

748
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,908
without talking to other nodes because

749
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,590
just the the time it takes to talk to

750
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,450
the other nodes increases the amount of

751
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,309
time that it takes that transaction to

752
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,990
get created and posted that creates a

753
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:54,280
bad user

754
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,900
perience you want this to be as

755
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,110
instantaneous as possible not have this

756
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,490
latency of like well let me ask all

757
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,800
7,000 and my friends if they have this

758
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,200
transaction ID yet wait for all those

759
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,389
responses and then if they one of them

760
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,370
says yes then I have to think of a new

761
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,470
number and then ask them all again it's

762
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,090
terrible so without getting like in

763
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,580
deeply into the technical aspect of how

764
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,530
snowflake works that's it the problem

765
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,059
with that is that if you're pinging a

766
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,800
single API over and over and over and

767
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,270
over and over from a specific location

768
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,669
chances are you're hitting the same

769
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,379
small number of nodes versus the entire

770
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,360
cluster that runs all of them oh so

771
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:34,690
you're not actually going to be getting

772
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:37,949
in transactions in a sequential or even

773
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:40,630
chronological order and without having

774
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,540
without scraping enough data from enough

775
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,580
nodes to have a whole sequential list of

776
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,559
these transaction IDs you're never

777
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,120
really sure if you're gathering all of

778
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,340
the data available for even the specific

779
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,780
time period that you're doing basically

780
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,629
what you have to do is keep scraping

781
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,780
over and over until you absolutely stop

782
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,520
getting non-stop getting unique

783
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,840
transactions and that can take forever

784
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,100
and it's awful and you're gonna burn

785
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,419
through a whole lot of poor people's

786
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,000
phone numbers who can now never use

787
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,000
venmo not my problem

788
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,880
the process of getting the new PA API

789
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,070
token has its own delay so like if you

790
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,470
get Bloggie you can dump the API really

791
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,149
fast but then once your token gets

792
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,520
blacklisted then you have to wait go

793
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,860
post that form get the token and come

794
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,150
back and that can be that's several

795
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,439
seconds which is an insane amount of

796
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,030
time when you extrapolate it out to the

797
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,470
fact that I was running this for about

798
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,510
six weeks yes sorry everyone ever about

799
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,280
your phone numbers they're definitely

800
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,570
still doing IP throttling so you have to

801
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,550
have your own sub system set up to

802
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,620
constantly cycle through api's that can

803
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,120
get expensive depending on what systems

804
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,610
you're using I found that there's some

805
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,570
really really cool companies out there

806
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:52,360
that will lease you residential IPs by

807
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,159
the thousands and nobody's gonna

808
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,709
blacklist residential ip's because

809
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,230
that's your customers I'm talking like

810
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:05,260
who's your big ISP up here Bell are you

811
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,790
are you gonna block the entire Bell ASN

812
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,629
at your company

813
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,428
you can't so for quite a price you can

814
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,200
get a few thousand residential IPs that

815
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,640
just can't be blocked or at least can't

816
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,059
be blocked for any extended period of

817
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,520
time

818
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:23,200
unless there's a really dumb guy running

819
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:26,290
your wofe which is common so what are

820
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,240
you gonna do one final thing I ran into

821
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,500
that that was a real bummer is I'm

822
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,880
pretty sure that they have a cold

823
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,120
storage system for really old

824
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,450
transactions and so it ended up being

825
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,340
like excruciating numbers of seconds

826
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,040
like 6 to 10 seconds to get any

827
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,080
transaction older than two weeks that's

828
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,649
awful that's way longer than account

829
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,000
creation time so that aside from

830
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,150
anything else like that really puts the

831
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,890
kibosh on the concept of oMG they're

832
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,000
gonna dump an ocean of our data and

833
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,309
they're gonna find out everything about

834
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,690
every American ever based on you know in

835
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:01,629
a few seconds they can get the entire

836
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,220
all the data for 2018 that's just not

837
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,480
possible that was my my original

838
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,040
intention when I was talking to Patrick

839
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,419
I said yeah I'm gonna jump all the 2018

840
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,659
and we're gonna find some cool it's

841
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:12,850
gonna be weird it's just not possible

842
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,370
I'm you well everything's possible with

843
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,870
enough resources me is a dude in my

844
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,899
basement who didn't want to spend any

845
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:22,330
money on this not really possible but

846
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,880
still I was able to get about six weeks

847
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,280
of data which i think is a good you know

848
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,720
subset of information you can use that

849
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,668
it's like a good focus group you know

850
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,770
its millions and millions of

851
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,179
transactions so you're still gonna find

852
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,059
some you know cool examples of what's

853
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,429
going on overall sorry about all this I

854
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,678
know since why you guys came here the

855
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:45,690
hookers and blow this is a DM from

856
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:49,870
Patrick it's like this is all he wants

857
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:52,510
but it's hard like I have to do a lot of

858
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,979
the legwork when you guys see you know

859
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,110
things like this that people pull out of

860
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,390
public feeds there's months of like

861
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,678
really excruciatingly boring crap like I

862
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,169
just showed you to get to the like the

863
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,190
stupid fun bits but the stupid fun bits

864
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:05,190
always make it worth it

865
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,740
so one here's some fun things I learned

866
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,510
who's got kids with with phones this is

867
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,820
what the kids are talking about these

868
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,440
days I this like I thought this was

869
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,060
really creative like all right trees

870
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,090
that's pretty obvious for weed like I

871
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:30,270
get that one any kind of crystal in a

872
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:33,870
drug little diamond oh that's pretty

873
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:36,030
crafty well done spoons like all right

874
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:41,070
coke spoons so you cook your heroin in

875
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:42,570
your spoons spoons are also a a an emoji

876
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,429
referencing general like mental health

877
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,409
and like payments for mental health or

878
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:49,050
like a mental health day like you'll see

879
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:52,140
like little spa icons like you know

880
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,760
massage in a couple of spoons and like

881
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,960
someone was telling me oh that's like

882
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,820
mental health day because there's this

883
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,900
whole spoon theory regarding depression

884
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,889
and mental health and you can google

885
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,060
that I won't get into it

886
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:04,980
because it has nothing to do with drugs

887
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:07,830
and that's not interesting this I mean

888
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,920
you know snow skiing powder cocaine

889
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,389
funny this one is super common heart

890
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,040
with lightning bolt and so it's

891
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,299
specifically these these two emojis

892
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,310
together heart with lightning bolts are

893
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:22,830
these dudes it's always MDMA or he and I

894
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,179
mean these are they so he's actually I'm

895
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,739
pretty sure anytime you see these it's

896
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,259
actually someone's around like

897
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,259
nobody actually it's like a man drugs

898
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,640
like but every time I think someone's

899
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,830
not that dumb I meet eight of them so

900
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:43,279
what are you gonna do so that was really

901
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:47,250
cool then I got this data based on

902
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,220
multiple transactions two were from a

903
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,659
single individual by unique individuals

904
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,790
and what I mean by that as I was

905
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,969
watching drug dealers anyone who's

906
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,650
getting like a ton of this guy from a

907
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,770
whole bunch of different people is

908
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,700
probably selling MDMA you know because

909
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,590
you're gonna get someone who's gonna

910
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,569
like send it as a joke once in a while

911
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,330
to a friend and I would write off those

912
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,930
one offs but like if someone's got 600

913
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:16,529
of these from unique user IDs probably

914
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:21,500
sling Annie so I make a note of his name

915
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,500
when he say you talk to him later

916
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:30,270
about the privacy dangers inherent in

917
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,799
the stuff and you know who doesn't

918
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,559
really care about personhood privacy's

919
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:39,420
people Annie it's a bad conversation

920
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:41,099
overall one interesting thing venmo

921
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,780
decided to alert me on even though they

922
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:46,020
still haven't done anything about

923
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,130
unlocking my account for me is this is

924
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,180
this came out about a week and a half

925
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:54,119
two weeks ago they specifically say you

926
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,490
are not allowed to mention narcotics

927
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,410
steroids certain controlled substances

928
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,569
or other products that present a risk to

929
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,490
consumer safety drug paraphernalia

930
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:06,089
cigarettes you can't even mention

931
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,308
cigarettes and venmo that encourage

932
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,420
promote facility planning stolen goods

933
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:14,010
busy you can't talk about anything

934
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:16,410
illegal or controlled in your posts it

935
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,849
was weird because I saw a huge drop in

936
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,020
that and the public feet as soon as this

937
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,640
came out and said oh or they've been

938
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,470
probably filtering these they're either

939
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,788
blocking transactions when you have when

940
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,200
you just put like little drug emotions

941
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,579
in there or they're completely block

942
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,058
ever filtering it out on the back end

943
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,859
after you post it we tested it last

944
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,750
night and they're definitely not block

945
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:36,450
blocking new transactions that have drug

946
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,710
references in them so we definitely sent

947
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:43,609
a lot of drug references over the

948
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:43,609
hackfest network to venmo so have fun

949
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,789
but and I was definitely finding them in

950
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,339
the public feed so I think they're just

951
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,380
either really slow about filtering them

952
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:54,808
out or just aren't devoting any time to

953
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,089
do to it and it had they have a lot of

954
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:00,990
users who first and foremost read the

955
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:02,670
Terms of Service who are you people

956
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,770
and are like and then also get really

957
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,750
freaked out by this by the Terms of

958
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:15,210
Service like oh I don't want to make

959
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:18,539
venmo mad so drinking so that was really

960
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,119
cool and fun but anyway like we're here

961
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:25,049
to talk about like the fun statistics I

962
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,869
noticed you guys don't want it oh you

963
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:29,279
know let me go back I'm gonna show you

964
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:30,779
could some cool stuff but the API first

965
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,970
cuz it's been like - interesting for too

966
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:34,600
long and I want to go back to the dry

967
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,890
crap

968
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,009
so I'm talking way faster than I thought

969
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,930
it was going to so this is what the two

970
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,880
api's look like and when I was writing

971
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,080
this script there are some super

972
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,520
annoying differences and by the way I

973
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,720
wrote everyone into the five script and

974
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,890
all haven't both on my github so you

975
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,569
guys can play around and see if you

976
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:55,279
could figure out like why one locks you

977
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:56,420
out and the other doesn't really you

978
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,830
know when you're writing a script or

979
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,270
some code and you've like you put a

980
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,830
semicolon in the wrong place because

981
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,690
you're used to writing JavaScript but

982
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:05,330
you're writing something and C and it

983
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,620
takes you like six days to figure out

984
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,290
what the hell you did wrong cuz

985
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,690
everything looks perfectly right that's

986
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:15,650
what these api's will do to you because

987
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:21,190
the the my favorite difference which

988
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:25,340
rekt me for like two days was the v5

989
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:27,950
uses paging as the key is the JSON key

990
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:31,220
for figuring out like the pagination

991
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:32,419
system it's a part of the script is you

992
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,069
have to ask for the next page next page

993
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,600
next page next page next page until

994
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:43,250
they're like get out of here and then

995
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:45,860
you're dead the v1 uses pagination I was

996
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,690
down for days like ping and people like

997
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,970
dude can you help me with this this used

998
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,530
to work I don't know what's going on and

999
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,299
it was because like I had just swapped

1000
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,390
these these words in there so you got to

1001
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,580
look out for little things like that and

1002
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,009
over here just the JIT like why would

1003
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,990
you mess with this layout so the the v5

1004
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:07,160
uses venomoth comm /a PS I should be

1005
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:10,459
five I found the v1 API just uh by URL

1006
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,049
brute-forcing at it's just at API divan

1007
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,450
mode calm like they're both still up and

1008
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,000
in it but it's API to venmo TOCOM slash

1009
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,410
be one slash stories so if you're

1010
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,030
already doing like slash be one why

1011
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,830
wouldn't you just do a slash b5 and

1012
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,900
throw your form 85 in there

1013
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,529
I don't know when I see things like this

1014
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,990
sometimes it's because they bought a new

1015
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,400
company and they just rolled it in and

1016
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,399
everything's annoying and then it does

1017
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,660
like slash stories and there's there's a

1018
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,610
bunch of other words you can plug in

1019
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,990
here that find interesting things that I

1020
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,490
wasn't going to get into and maybe I

1021
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,040
should have but you guys can brute force

1022
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:46,310
dead and have fun and then you have the

1023
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,569
v1 I really want to use because it uses

1024
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,619
transaction IDs

1025
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:53,058
a transaction ID and it says it forces

1026
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,529
an arbitrary limit of 20 but then what I

1027
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:55,819
do is I just changed that on the back

1028
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,849
end and I've found I can get about a

1029
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:59,989
hundred per page when you change it

1030
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:03,499
anything more and it'll just fall back

1031
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:06,410
200 I really want to figure out how to

1032
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:09,078
get this v1 to work because if you can

1033
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,479
just ask for strings of transaction IDs

1034
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,160
you're bypassing that whole snowflake

1035
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:15,198
problem of not knowing if you ever had

1036
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,538
all the data of not knowing where it

1037
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,920
starts and ends but so far I haven't

1038
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,569
been able to figure out how to make the

1039
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,359
v1 play nice without just completely

1040
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:28,579
shutting down everything ever it's super

1041
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:31,098
annoying and then of course the v5 this

1042
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:32,660
is the the epoch time everyone knows

1043
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:38,839
what a pocket I'm is right UNIX epoch

1044
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:40,879
time look it up yeah but other than that

1045
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:42,349
the the JSON output is all the same so

1046
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,160
that's that's still cool so everything

1047
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:50,180
else would still work this is this is

1048
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,618
one one requests one response to the

1049
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,259
request this is the amount of data you

1050
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:57,499
get from one single request it's an

1051
00:40:54,259 --> 00:41:00,489
immense amount of data and so I ran into

1052
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:03,049
problems with just sifting through that

1053
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:05,299
you can you know take your JSON and

1054
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:07,819
throw it in an SQL database that takes a

1055
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:10,339
long time to do and then searching

1056
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:12,049
through that takes a lot of it there's a

1057
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:13,308
ton of disk i/o just involved with this

1058
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,660
and that's really what I was bumping up

1059
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:17,809
against and now you're paying for you

1060
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,709
know VMs with solid state disks and for

1061
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,170
something when you're just messing

1062
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:23,058
around you can get rough but it's easier

1063
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,920
to just throw three gigs you know a few

1064
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,029
weeks worth on your laptop and do it

1065
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,369
that way but if you're gonna try and

1066
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:30,140
dump an entire year you start to get to

1067
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,969
the point where you need some legit

1068
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,979
compute resources to take care of that

1069
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:35,959
I'm at the point now where I'm going

1070
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:37,549
alright do a do I want to keep dumping

1071
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:40,459
this do I really want to get the entire

1072
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:41,869
20 18 in here and then if I do like I'm

1073
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,038
gonna have to spin up like a kiss and

1074
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,190
you're a bunch of Cassandra nodes or

1075
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,170
something so that's kind of crazy but

1076
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,779
anyway back to the fun stuff it's enough

1077
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,209
of that right they got like five minutes

1078
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:57,890
so we're just gonna have some fun so

1079
00:41:53,209 --> 00:42:00,589
there's hey I love Kermit um let me

1080
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,490
bring this one up sorry haha you tell

1081
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:04,700
like I'm still testing

1082
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,500
his talk out I have the I brought it up

1083
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,930
in yes so this is me just running a

1084
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,830
quick script to jump all my results and

1085
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,868
find the top 50 most repeated strings in

1086
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,250
venmo

1087
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:18,140
for the six month period so this is

1088
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,390
mostly September in October that's in

1089
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,650
here make this bigger and then well I

1090
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,290
have a bigger one where I show you the

1091
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:28,369
emojis like you just saw so far and away

1092
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:33,140
like pizza like just pizza right out of

1093
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:36,740
the gate we'll talk about the emojis in

1094
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:40,100
a minute but like pretty neat stuff I

1095
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:43,910
guess really really average stuff lotto

1096
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,529
like 2500 people talking about the

1097
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,759
lottery like who's buying lotto tickets

1098
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,650
from other people that often is that

1099
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,590
weird there's that a faint I don't know

1100
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,820
what that is company pools maybe okay

1101
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,080
cool see I knew this would be fun

1102
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,420
because there's stuff that confuses me

1103
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,270
now we have like 300 of you in here that

1104
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,980
can kick your ideas around the text

1105
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,170
rings really weren't that interesting it

1106
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,700
was the emojis that really got me so

1107
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,440
let's take a look at those and this is

1108
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,080
this is we were having a blast with this

1109
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,730
last night

1110
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,340
Pizza obvious thumbs up you know

1111
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:19,460
whatever it's such a default thing um

1112
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:23,480
who knows what this one is shopping bags

1113
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:28,100
bowtie fortune cookie anyone positive

1114
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,910
guess 3,600 people use this exact string

1115
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:36,470
in a six week period

1116
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:38,779
what is that 336 thousand or one person

1117
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,089
did it 36 thousand times I don't I don't

1118
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,590
have the clustered set up yet to be able

1119
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:45,080
to like determine the unique ideas in

1120
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,609
that regard yet that I do but it takes a

1121
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,970
long time it's not it I didn't have time

1122
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:50,150
for this

1123
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:54,049
anyway soccer this is the u.s. we only

1124
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,940
like soccer every four years and this

1125
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,670
was a soccer year but this is like wait

1126
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,460
I scraped this after the soccer time was

1127
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,890
done I don't know what that's about

1128
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:11,350
who knows what this character is please

1129
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:11,350
somebody sorry it's Korean say louder

1130
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,400
okay yes so I can sell this was really

1131
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,609
interesting because it's it's five down

1132
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,789
it's sort of colloquially I was told

1133
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:28,578
means like boom something that expresses

1134
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:31,939
like the noise boom but it's rarely just

1135
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:33,199
used by itself and like we couldn't

1136
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,670
figure out why the single character

1137
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,469
abused thirteen thousand times other

1138
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,660
than a quickly colloquial maybe like

1139
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:41,839
when you pay some when you go boom paid

1140
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,759
you but like why are they using the

1141
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:51,249
Korean character repair mind this is us

1142
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:51,249
only yes feminine body oh man

1143
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:04,500
[Applause]

1144
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:10,970
that's some CTF level it's that's

1145
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,970
thinking way outside the box that's I

1146
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:19,820
don't know I just work here moving on

1147
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,410
yeah we're running out of time

1148
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,760
specifically for wineglasses like where

1149
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,940
these are exact strings that are

1150
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,670
repeated so that's interesting

1151
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,680
yeah flowers books like this is a weird

1152
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,360
again

1153
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,930
exactly this string is used four

1154
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,930
thousand times

1155
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:42,990
lightning duck personal favorite about

1156
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:47,810
four thousand people are really into

1157
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:51,750
lightning ducks anyone yeah I don't know

1158
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:56,700
this this explicitly long string of de

1159
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:58,020
mogi soccer tickets so a lot of people

1160
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,279
must go to local games I guess maybe

1161
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,050
we're still like excited and we're

1162
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,490
checking out our local teams this is

1163
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,720
clearly electric bill this is probably

1164
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:08,939
electric bill this is definitely

1165
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:17,730
strippers this is a weird one airplane

1166
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:22,590
100 dark moon face what is this 2,200

1167
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:24,870
people I don't know mile-high yeah maybe

1168
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,220
I don't know they do have that weird

1169
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,080
lighting in the bed of their airplane

1170
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,910
bathrooms it makes you look like that

1171
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,250
I'll take it

1172
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:35,580
this is 1,200 people about two shirts I

1173
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:37,380
don't sew these like weird like long

1174
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:40,319
explicit shrinks of emoji I think are

1175
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,690
either someone who definitely like ate

1176
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,100
out a lot in this period of time and

1177
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,690
paid the same place and they just like

1178
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,420
this string just auto-populates and like

1179
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,490
their autocorrect or whatever or there

1180
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,470
are lots of apps that will use venmo as

1181
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,750
a payment method and like I said we'll

1182
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,310
post strings to your public venmo feed

1183
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:59,640
without you even knowing that they've

1184
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:03,240
done it and so I think there's there's

1185
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,569
definitely one and I think it was oh I

1186
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,569
know what it was if I go back to this

1187
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,930
guy and I promise I'm almost done but

1188
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,930
this is

1189
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:21,410
there is four bills on split wise comm

1190
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,020
do you think 1500 people literally typed

1191
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:25,940
that out or do you think split wise

1192
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,730
composted that to their venmo feed

1193
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,820
without them knowing I think that's what

1194
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,410
happened and so that's a great indicator

1195
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,720
that there's a lot more going on so it's

1196
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,430
not even a matter of you consciously

1197
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,169
being aware of what you are personally

1198
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,520
posting your venmo feed there's stuff

1199
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,690
going on behind that in the background

1200
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,370
that you don't see and even when you

1201
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,870
switch to your public feed you don't see

1202
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,700
your transaction because in the

1203
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,040
microsecond that it took you to flip to

1204
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,960
the other tab twenty-seven thousand

1205
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,150
transactions already surpassed years

1206
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,410
you'll never see it so there's a lot

1207
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,390
being posted there you're not even aware

1208
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,390
of and that's that's an awful scenario

1209
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,410
yeah so this is fun I'll put the script

1210
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,759
up in my github and you guys can dump a

1211
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,049
ton of data and just do a lot of

1212
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,550
grepping or whatever if you want to

1213
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,170
