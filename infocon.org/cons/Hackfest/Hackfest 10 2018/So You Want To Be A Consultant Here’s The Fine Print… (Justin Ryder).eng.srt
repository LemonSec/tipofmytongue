always trying to pay it forward there

59
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,379
were a lot of people that helped me get

60
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,939
to where I am and it's only right that I

61
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,849
do the same so getting started in

62
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,069
consulting there's a couple different

63
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,530
paths but they're not really mutually

64
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:52,530
exclusive one side is education and

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,780
education is obviously very important if

66
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,060
you're just coming into this you may not

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,290
really know a lot for me personally my

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,230
background was I was an industrial

69
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,349
welder before I got into information

70
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,310
security yeah those one of these things

71
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:10,230
it's not like the other but I was also

72
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,569
the only guy who could fix a printer jam

73
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:18,738
in the entire company and set up certain

74
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:23,548
fibre switches from the company that we

75
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:25,620
acquired over time so we had we had

76
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,329
these Cisco switches with a fiber

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,060
backbone and nobody knew how to set them

78
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,980
up so what happens you know the

79
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,919
industrial welder has to take his mask

80
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,738
off in his gauntlets and you know go set

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,840
up this switch College is very important

82
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,459
it's going to teach you a few things I

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,590
don't want to say it's the only thing

84
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,049
especially in the United States right

85
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,120
now I apologize for everything you know

86
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:53,909
not my fault but we look kind of dumb

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,769
it's not the only route to take but you

88
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,078
will learn a lot of the basics in there

89
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,040
you know things like the OSI model which

90
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,549
you know we still occasionally used

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,629
subnetting which we use a lot

92
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,430
certifications are also another very

93
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,149
important thing because if you look at

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,659
any job posting what's listed there a

95
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,250
degree and probably ten random

96
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:20,579
certifications that don't go together

97
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,740
because you know Bill and Mary from HR

98
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,860
read this thing that was a link from a

99
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,150
Pinterest post somewhere and this is

100
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,280
what your cybersecurity

101
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,049
we'll need to have but it's always good

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,090
to have some of those they do teach

103
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,610
certain things myself I just finished

104
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,948
the sands forensics 500 windows

105
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,430
forensics awesome class you know

106
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,800
shameless plug for them as well and then

107
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,620
of course Sands itself they teach a lot

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,820
of amazing courses as well as having a

109
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,910
graduates program now if you have the

110
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,090
funding and mental fortitude to go

111
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,979
through that it's a great program the

112
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,570
other side is networking and this is

113
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:04,110
really more for me personally what I

114
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,440
leveraged networking is amazing because

115
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,289
it gives you a way to circumvent that HR

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,650
screen because let's face it when you

117
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,940
look at the postings for certain jobs

118
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,070
specifically with consulting they're

119
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,840
gonna want a ton of certifications none

120
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,539
of them make sense and you might have

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,570
three out of the ten they're just it's

122
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,099
the most random stuff in the world and

123
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,490
for somebody like myself who again was a

124
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,349
welder I got myself on LinkedIn which

125
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,960
you know let's face it LinkedIn is like

126
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:37,620
professional Facebook and then there's

127
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,000
Twitter twitter was great because it

128
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,430
gave me an opportunity to follow people

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,970
that I met at a conference that I went

130
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,740
to on a whim and here was this one

131
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,940
person and I started a conversation with

132
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,229
them and then I was able to watch the

133
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,760
conversations that they were having with

134
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,300
other people and introduced myself to

135
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,039
them and before you know it your your

136
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,470
area of your network starts to grow

137
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,380
immensely the other thing is

138
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,090
professional events certain prevent

139
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,219
professional events like network after

140
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,369
work is a huge one at least down in the

141
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,630
states they're in every major city

142
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,490
there's a couple of them a month and

143
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,729
it's an opportunity just to get together

144
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,979
in an open venue like this have some

145
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,599
drinks talk to some people get your name

146
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,020
out there exchange some business cards

147
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,219
and start to meet other people in the

148
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,990
field that's gonna open up some doors

149
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,099
for you conferences why are we here

150
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,479
we're here to learn things we're here to

151
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:35,460
talk to people right that was really how

152
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,340
I got my start was besides Detroit the

153
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,000
first year it was held in a vegetable

154
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:45,039
processing plant

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,620
yeah yeah we were top-notch and I was

156
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,500
scared to death I was you know again a

157
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,260
welder who grew up in the sticks out in

158
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,470
Michigan West Michigan never seen a

159
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,750
parking meter in my entire life and I

160
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,910
was in downtown Detroit pretty certain I

161
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,400
was gonna get shot but I figured it was

162
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,320
a risk I was willing to take got a

163
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,710
ticket because again never saw a parking

164
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,260
meter didn't know what it was therefore

165
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,969
it was quite an experience but I met a

166
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:19,870
lot of those people there that kind of

167
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:21,100
helped kick my career off so as you go

168
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,169
through and do that you start to meet

169
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,370
people you're gonna get some interview

170
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,020
set up in my case the people that I met

171
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,550
at the conferences and on Twitter were

172
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,830
actually the people who were setting up

173
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,540
a lot of these interviews for me that's

174
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,150
how you know you're networking with the

175
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,280
right people because they want to see

176
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,469
you succeed because if you succeed you

177
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,669
go work for them guess what you're gonna

178
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,440
help build their success as well but if

179
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,890
you fail the plan you should probably

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,570
plan to fail if you'd know nothing about

181
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,070
the company that you're interviewing for

182
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,210
it's not gonna go well

183
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,340
LinkedIn again is gonna be your best

184
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,830
friend you have the opportunity to go in

185
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,109
look at the company who works there did

186
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,190
you meet somebody from there at one of

187
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,160
those networking events or at a

188
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,390
conference can you ping them on the side

189
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,910
and say hey I just applied at this

190
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,909
company you know I'm supposed to

191
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,690
interview with so-and-so on thursday can

192
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,030
you put in a good word for me for me I

193
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,740
kind of like I like to liken that to pen

194
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,289
testing if you're gonna do a social

195
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,510
engineering engagement do you just walk

196
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,040
in there or do yet you know do a little

197
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,049
background research try to do a little

198
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,610
open-source intelligence and learn a

199
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:39,728
little bit about your target it's the

200
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,830
same deal you're gonna fail despite all

201
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,880
your preparation you're still gonna fail

202
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,000
it's gonna happen in it and it's great

203
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,870
for me a personal story of mine I

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,900
interviewed with a company out of Grand

205
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,680
Rapids Michigan and I had on my resume

206
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,410
that I was a

207
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,270
proficient Linux administrator and I was

208
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,620
just beaming when I went in there

209
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,270
because this was a job for a Linux

210
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,930
administrator so I thought this is gonna

211
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:07,930
be great and I went through answered

212
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,149
everything correct you know did all the

213
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,469
right things sat up straight had a smile

214
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:17,140
all that and then their current Linux

215
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,910
administrator asked me what does the

216
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,230
command Chone do dead silence I couldn't

217
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,730
for the life of me think about it you

218
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,440
know I did that you know you look up

219
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,290
like you're like indexing your brain

220
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,950
like that's gonna help you and nothing

221
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,079
happens

222
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,700
dead silence the most Awkward time in

223
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,410
the world probably sweat a gallon a

224
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,490
sweat just sitting there trying to think

225
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,829
of it but that's stuck with me now what

226
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,149
are you doing you're changing ownership

227
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,529
duh it's right you know it basically

228
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,190
tells you but in that moment I forgot it

229
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,770
happens

230
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,209
I didn't land that job and I landed the

231
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,569
next one that actually launched my

232
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:57,010
career and you know really kind of sent

233
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,770
everything along if I'd have taken that

234
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,930
job I'd probably still be there and it

235
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:08,579
wasn't all that great yeah

236
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,930
networking still more wasn't getting

237
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,670
most of those opportunities are gonna be

238
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,469
from those acquaintances and those

239
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,680
people that you meet it gets you past

240
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,050
that dreaded HR screen I try to do this

241
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,239
all the time anybody that I know that is

242
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,390
looking for an information security job

243
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,160
I'll take their resume and I'll bring it

244
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,010
to the hiring manager and get it around

245
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,230
HR because HR is gonna be looking for

246
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,400
those silly things that nobody's can

247
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,470
have that's gonna check all the boxes

248
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,790
you're never gonna find that Unicorn

249
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,790
they don't exist

250
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,240
if you don't have all those apply for

251
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:50,290

252

255
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,779
COBOL but it still says it for some

256
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,640
reason in the job posting

257
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,290
we have no mid-range systems I don't

258
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,680

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:46,300
your first real consulting gig you've

272
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,560
made it right yeah no I like to think of

273
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,349
it as allow me to show you everything

274
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,420
you don't know because in consulting

275
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,000
you're never going to find the systems

276
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,380
that you're familiar with one really

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,590
good example of this was the first

278
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,320
off-site customer that I got to go see I

279
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,060
walked into their server closet it

280
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,620
wasn't a data center or anything like

281
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,209
that of course you think your big-time

282
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,340
consultant now you're gonna just see all

283
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,170
these great you know collocations and

284
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,510
data centers no it was it was a closet a

285
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,760
literal closet and their file and print

286
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,230
server didn't have a cover on it because

287
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,689
they were afraid if they set it on there

288
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,870
it would just shut off for some

289
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,210
something would ground out and shut off

290
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,300
and as I was in there doing a Symantec

291
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:34,600
endpoint protection assessment a 56k

292
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:35,770
modem started screaming yeah you

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,780
recognize it but it's still not

294
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,790
something you want to hear and they were

295
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,839
passing financials back and forth

296
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,959
between locations over this 56k modem so

297
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,440
that happened and you just never know

298
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,830
what you're gonna run into embrace it

299
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,780
embrace your suck you're not gonna know

300
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,950
but you're gonna learn and that those

301
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,790
are the things that propel you through

302
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:03,070
your career is the those situations one

303
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,860
of my favorite sayings is from Maynard

304
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,740
James Keenan we have any tool perfect

305
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,610
circle Puscifer ten other bands that he

306
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,140
probably sings in one of my favorite

307
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,030
quotes from him is he was doing an

308
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,680
interview for revolver magazine and he

309
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,630
said you're either winning or you're

310
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,180
learning you only lose

311
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,380
if you don't learn and that's just

312
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,640
something that I've kind of held on to

313
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,500
because you're gonna have some bad times

314
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:36,949
so let's have storytime one of my worst

315
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,820
times was the the first real big

316
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,220
engagement that I was ever on it was for

317
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,440
a global company and I was doing a

318
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,530
Symantec endpoint protection health

319
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,070
check for them they were on three

320
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,500
continents and I remember very

321
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,570
specifically that they had 12 group

322
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,590
update providers does anybody here know

323
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,060
Symantec endpoint protection okay

324
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,370
I didn't know what a group update

325
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,359
provider was I wasn't even certified in

326
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,970
SAP and I was doing this health check

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,950
for them so after a week of scratching

328
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,980
my head trying to figure out what best

329
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:19,910
practices were and not really being able

330
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,590
to do my job very well the salesperson

331
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,939
said that even his ten year old son

332
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,730
could handle this so it wouldn't be a

333
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,430
big deal it came time to give my final

334
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,330
report it was the most awkward phone

335
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:34,189
call in my entire life so I'm trying to

336
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,310
explain you know what the best practices

337
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,380
are and they their expert is coming back

338
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,660
and asking me questions about why that

339
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,180
would be the best practice for them dead

340
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,130
silence I didn't have the answers I

341
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,680
didn't know why I was telling them what

342
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,050
I could tell what I was telling them I

343
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,479
really wasn't in any position to be

344
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,040
doing that and there was just a lot of

345
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,660
dead air which is not a good thing to

346
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,360
have on a phone call so that one

347
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,699
experience though of not knowing was

348
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,110
great because it forced me to get into

349
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,090
the product and really propel myself

350
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,700
because I never wanted to fail like that

351
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,490
again and if you get into consulting

352
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,540
you're going to have that moment there's

353
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:19,570
no way around it okay any of my you know

354
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,819
current consultants you guys have those

355
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,180
yeah it's a bad time but it's gonna

356
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,420
propel you to learn more so don't sweat

357
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,239
it

358
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,620
brush it off your shoulder I was ready

359
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,570
to throw in the towel and go back to

360
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,750
welding it was such a bad time

361
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,279
unfortunately my wife said

362
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,990
how much do you know how quickly did you

363
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,670
make this transition you're gonna have

364
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:45,470
these times some of the best advice I

365
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:49,270
ever had so some of the lessons that I

366
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:53,000
learned during that time was ambition is

367
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:57,260
great but you have to know when to ask

368
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,180
for help that's not a bad thing in my

369
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,910
case I should have gone back to the

370
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,170
salesperson and said hey look you know I

371
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,370
understand your 10 year old could do

372
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,610
this your 10 year old probably knows

373
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:11,990
more than me mine does he's a great

374
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,910
great locksmith that's what I should

375
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,950
have done as I should went back to him

376
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,230
and said this isn't working out let's

377
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,820
fix this before we crash this engagement

378
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,470
because instead of going headlong into

379
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,810
it we could have fixed it we could have

380
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,510
got you know a more experienced

381
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,609
consultant in somebody who was already

382
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,800
certified in the product to sit with me

383
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,080
and mentor me and walkthrough together

384
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,969
and make this a good experience for the

385
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,400
customer and a good learning experience

386
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:45,070
for me as well and then everybody does

387
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,390
better an ambition is kind of a

388
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,700
double-edged sword I like to say that

389
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,350
it's one of those things that I can't

390
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,060
teach you know I can teach a lot of

391
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,010
things but I can't teach ambition people

392
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,410
either have it or they don't they have

393
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,660
to find it I can teach skills you know

394
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,730
you want to learn how to you know set up

395
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,620
rules on a firewall no problem let's sit

396
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,140
down we'll crash course through it I'm

397
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,880
sure I've got an you know some garbage a

398
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,140
si sitting in a closet somewhere I can

399
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,400
throw you in you know we'll figure it

400
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,990
out

401
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,630
but ambition that's that's something

402
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,870
that's got to come from inside it's also

403
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:21,050
very quickly a very easy to quickly

404
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,489
overwhelm yourself with ambition

405
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,980
I've one of these guys right now one of

406
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,809
my junior guys he will say yes to

407
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,640
everything he wants to be on every

408
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,770
project he wants to learn everything and

409
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,450
sometimes we just have to pump the

410
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,950
brakes on them a little bit because

411
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,250
otherwise he'll take everything on it'll

412
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,470
never accomplish anything it happens so

413
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,090
we talk about ambition being our

414
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,429
double-edged sword double-edged sword of

415
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:47,050
a thousand truths if anybody gets that

416
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,050
we can be friends

417
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,740
so what's next in your career you've

418
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:59,000
made it to that first engagement you

419
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,570
survived you've embraced your 'suck what

420
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,460
next

421
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:07,730
don't settle it's very easy to kind of

422
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,200
get into cruise control and just coast

423
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,420
along in that job because it gets

424
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,070
comfortable my first consulting

425
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,570
engagement I really couldn't do any

426
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,250
wrong because they were always throwing

427
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,980
me the same types of engagements over

428
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,080
and over again and you could have almost

429
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,030
just changed the name of the company on

430
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,770
the front page print it back out send it

431
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,840
out here these are the things you need

432
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,220
to fix because they were the same

433
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,260
vulnerabilities over and over again

434
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,730
where it was the same product over and

435
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:37,730
over again we'd keep seeing it but when

436
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:40,760
I say don't settle be appreciative for

437
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,490
the opportunity that you've had there in

438
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,160
my case I knew next to nothing starting

439
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,560
that first engagement at that first

440
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,700
company I very much knew more about

441
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,370
welding than I did

442
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,720
IT security be respectful with everybody

443
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,270
that you work with I can't stress that

444
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,360
enough you never know what somebody else

445
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,860
is working on what they know what

446
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,830
they've experienced and the things that

447
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,050
you can learn from them I also like to

448
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,020
say be humble because one of those

449
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,430
opportunities that's gonna crush you is

450
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,050
right around the corner and they're

451
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,110
gonna happen and you just have to

452
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,870
embrace them and learn from them but do

453
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,520
not settle there's always gonna be

454
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,889
another opportunity out there it's gonna

455
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,879
be better and it's gonna be a way for

456
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,980
you to move Hey

457
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,460
networking once more still very much a

458
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,020
thing here because as you get out on the

459
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,760
road and you start going to other

460
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,730
companies you're gonna start to meet

461
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,060
more people

462
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:46,130
they're gonna know your face because you

463
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,310
ultimately are the face of the company

464
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,960
that you work for when you go there some

465
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,000
of the best advice I was ever given was

466
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,060
by a guy by the name of Wolfgang

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,970
Gorelick a good friend of mine and he

468
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,889
really was the one who got me started my

469
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,610
first three interviews he lined them up

470
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,899
he knew nothing about my experience not

471
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,459
a thing I knew nothing about Windows

472
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,709
servers he got me an interview for a

473
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,830
Windows server admin position yeah

474
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:17,480
awkward right but he believed in my

475
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,149
ambition enough that he was willing to

476
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,330
do that that stuff's gonna happen but

477
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,768
you are your own brand you're gonna

478
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,299
leave that company at some point the

479
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,760
company's gonna fold something's going

480
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:32,750
to happen but that customer is gonna

481
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,250
remember your face with the company my

482
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,620
customers didn't know CBI

483
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,240
they knew Justin and they knew if they

484
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,399
had a problem they could call Justin

485
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,200
they weren't gonna call CBI because

486
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:44,389
Justin knew their environment Justin

487
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,470
knew them and Justin knew that

488
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:51,010
situations that they were in so just

489
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,000
remember that that you're the face and

490
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:58,690
some of the things that are gonna come

491
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,639
from that are job offers that's awkward

492
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,830
I would often find myself on residency's

493
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,080
for six months or more probably the

494
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,658
biggest one was about a year and a half

495
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,990
and when the engagement finally ended

496
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:13,360
they made me a job offer for more money

497
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,240
because they just wanted to keep me on

498
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,990
to run their cybersecurity program it's

499
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,480
kind of a curse and a blessing one it

500
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,389
gives you back a plan if anybody is

501
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,809
familiar with One World labs and the

502
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:32,389
situation surrounding that it was a bad

503
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,820
time there was some unfortunate things

504
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:37,399
that happened as part of a fallout from

505
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,809
a talk and all of a sudden there were a

506
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:42,979
lot of consultants who you needed to

507
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:45,500
find other places to work when you get

508
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,909
out on the road you get to find some of

509
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,600
those opportunities and you make those

510
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:52,309
connections just in case you also have

511
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,428
opportunities for raises but I want to

512
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,120
stress a lot of caution with these most

513
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,320
of those job offers that I was given

514
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,479
were also for more money than I was

515
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,189
making consulting because at the end of

516
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,580
the day they were paying the consulting

517
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,490
house a hell of a lot more money than

518
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,309
the consulting house is paying me so it

519
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,490
made sense for them to do it but I

520
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:18,010
really have to caution that

521
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,720
one if you find yourself in a lot of

522
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,490
engagements don't go back to your

523
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,040
company every month when a new customer

524
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,950
gives you a job offer because then it

525
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,330
looks like you just want to jump ship

526
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,360
but going to them with the occasional

527
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,129
one and framing it correctly I would

528
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,919
often invite my manager out for dinner

529
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,600
and you know we'd meet up and I just

530
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,630
kind of been Jesse yeah can you believe

531
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,850
they wanted to offer me ten thousand

532
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,530
more than what cbi is paying me right

533
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,959
now to stay there

534
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,280
and about a week later he'd be like hey

535
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,790
you're not gonna believe this we found

536
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,500
some more money for you like yeah we

537
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,450
just went out and there's a coffee can

538
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,220
in the backyard we dug it up and you

539
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,090
know we found some money in there huh

540
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,820
strange strange how that happens but be

541
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:07,899
very mindful of any non-compete that you

542
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,850
may have signed yeah cuz those come back

543
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,040
to bite you cuz we all read the you know

544
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,419
we read EULA's and we read contracts and

545
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,870
all that stuff before we sign them right

546
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:21,760
everybody ya know it in my case I know I

547
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,939
signed one when I started at that first

548
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,140
company because I was so excited yeah

549
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,000
you don't pay any attention to that

550
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:33,100
stuff and as such it ended up being a

551
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,050
big process to actually get out there

552
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,809
out of there and move to the company

553
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,970
that I work for now which by the

554
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:44,050
vibration I'm guessing a few people have

555
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,970
figured out you can learn something from

556
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:52,020
everyone

557
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:55,050
beware the janitor one of my first jobs

558
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:58,300
outside of high school was working as a

559
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:01,690
custodian will call them janitor so on

560
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,350
and so forth they know everything they

561
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,380
know everyone they see everything for me

562
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,820
myself I was an 18 year old working for

563
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,100
my now father-in-law

564
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:17,110
hey I'll network out and I would be in

565
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,050
several companies at night seeing all

566
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,159
the papers on the desks seeing

567
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,080
everything that was being thrown away

568
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,110
learning everything about every aspect

569
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,060
of that company and you start to pick up

570
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,060
little things that

571
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,610
believe it or not you can use them later

572
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,530
one of the things that I picked up was

573
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,570
toilet bowl cleaner takes care of the

574
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:40,840
calcium stains on stainless steel

575
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:44,760
drinking fountains but you didn't know

576
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,050
that but it also got me in in a pen test

577
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,370
because I went in with the caddy and I

578
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,500
was able to prove to the security guard

579
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,669
right there in the lobby that I knew

580
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,530
what I was doing and I had to get on the

581
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,940
second and third floor and if he wanted

582
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,139
he could come with me it's gonna take

583
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,810
two or three minutes

584
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,000
Bam Bam I'm in and out no problem I was

585
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,590
bam bam in and out no problem but I got

586
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,390
what I needed to get and I got access to

587
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,860
the floor so something silly like that

588
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,680
you can learn something from everyone

589
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,840
don't discredit them I can't stress that

590
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,760
enough

591
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,959
also one more reason to beware the

592
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,970
janitor never screw with the person who

593
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:30,370
cleans your coffee cup and scrubs the

594
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:33,570
toilets okay life lesson so fast forward

595
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:38,439
a couple years you've been on the road

596
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:41,530
it wears on you have realistic

597
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,580
expectations for what your life is going

598
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:49,000
to look like when you're on the road 307

599
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:53,020
nights how much I was home the joke was

600
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,050
I have a great home it's what I'm told I

601
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,870
had to get my brother to basically move

602
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,129
into my house to take care of my dog

603
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,659
because some situations we'll talk about

604
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,330
in a minute

605
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,910
are you an introvert God how many of us

606
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,260
are introverts in this field right you

607
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,220
can't bring your blanket for it with you

608
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,410
on site as much as I wanted to if you're

609
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,750
an extrovert it's great you get to meet

610
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,210
tons of people you get to talk to all

611
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:22,870
the people it's great introvert uh it's

612
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:25,900
he'll have an honest conversation with

613
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:28,659
your partner are you married are you

614
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:32,830
getting married you might not see them a

615
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:36,760
whole lot how about kids do you have

616
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:40,830
kids do you want kids I had four yeah

617
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,220
that's a bad time pets

618
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:47,939
you know at a dog a cat some number of

619
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:52,290
fish it fluctuates you know they're like

620
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,420
rabbits all that stuff has to be taken

621
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,850
into account you have to care for those

622
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:01,290
things I was home a day and a half a

623
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:03,419
week for three years and I had a

624
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,670
brand-new daughter three months old when

625
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,310
I went on the road that's gonna mess

626
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,900
with you so that's all stuff that you

627
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,909
really have to take into account before

628
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,610
you decide to make that move are you

629
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,970
ready for it

630
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:20,520
my youngest brother single guy 21 years

631
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,260
old I couldn't kick him in the ass hard

632
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,250
enough to get him into consulting it was

633
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,770
like you're gonna go see the world on

634
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,120
somebody else's dime you got to get to

635
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,770
travel you're gonna rack up SkyMiles

636
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,919
Hotel points everything whatever you

637
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:36,480
want I bought my ps4 off hotel points

638
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,400
you know why not but have that

639
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,960
conversation because you're gonna run

640
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,850
into some times where it gets difficult

641
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,250
to be very candid and very real with you

642
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:50,730
guys one of the hardest conversations I

643
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,870
ever had was that same year of 2015 when

644
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:56,940
I had those three hundred and seven

645
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:59,669
nights I arrived home and I could tell

646
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,950
that something was bothering my wife my

647
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:06,000
kids were upset you could see a change

648
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:07,260
in them over time and she pulled me

649
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,940
inside she just said you know what to be

650
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,430
honest I'm just exciting for the day

651
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,920
when you just don't come home because

652
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:17,720
there's not a point and I was expecting

653
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,340
her to say you know just don't because I

654
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,300
was at the hotel all the time I was

655
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:27,139
never home that can happen it can happen

656
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:31,770
and it does happen to a lot of people

657
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,120
it's a bad time since then I got off the

658
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,860
road you know just well fast-forward a

659
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,419
little bit here everything's cool now

660
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,120
everything's good kids are happy

661
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:46,050
daughter spends all my money it's great

662
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:47,429
yeah you know but as far as the self

663
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,399
care is concerned this is probably one

664
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:53,430
of the most important parts of going on

665
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,630
the road and being a consultant there

666
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,330
are a lot of consultants who

667
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,580
from home and you know that stuff's not

668
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,240
too bad you just kind of shut yourself

669
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,379
away you know do your thing but if

670
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,340
you're gonna be a road warrior and

671
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,679
you're gonna be on the road a lot of

672
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:12,120
times I would always hear that it's

673
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,980
great you get to see all these you'd

674
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,059
stay in all these great hotels you know

675
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,450
you get to travel to all these great

676
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,070
places and see all these huge cities and

677
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,820
you know do all these restaurants and it

678
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,240
sounds great

679
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,100
but in reality you're at the customer

680
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,929
site and then you go back to your hotel

681
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,990
room and you work from your hotel room

682
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:32,640
for another five six hours you wander

683
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,380
down to the hotel bar because you don't

684
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,610
really want to go out you're tired you

685
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,830
you don't really want to do that you've

686
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,399
already eaten at every restaurant around

687
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,960
you don't have time to go see the city

688
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,830
so this is what your hotel room starts

689
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,940
to feel like it looks great but

690
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:53,039
ultimately it kind of feels like a

691
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:55,740
prison cell over time some of the

692
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,070
recommendations that I can make that I

693
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:04,799
learned really in the last year that I

694
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:05,580
was on the road join the gym it's not

695
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,908
for everyone

696
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,949
it ended up being my thing you know I

697
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:15,570
had more here last time I was here I

698
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,950
also had about 50 more pounds but it

699
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,889
gives you an opportunity to get out of

700
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:22,140
that prison cell hotel room burn off

701
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,539
some stress if you look for something

702
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,950
with nationwide facilities and myself I

703
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,408
like to go to snap because I can find

704
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,230
one in pretty much every city that I end

705
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:34,289
up having to travel to but it gives you

706
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:37,020
an opportunity to get out and talk to

707
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:39,179
people and burn off some stress take

708
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,418
online or on-premises classes the

709
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,370
on-prem stuff can be kind of difficult

710
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:46,380
because you may not necessarily know

711
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,000
what your schedule is going to be I did

712
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,070
a lot of residency so I knew where I was

713
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,650
going to be for about six months at a

714
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,658
time there's kind of a staff

715
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,400
augmentation type thing where you'd come

716
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,470
in and you'd launch something get it

717
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,900
going and kind of run it for a little

718
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,159
bit

719
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,440
the on-prem stuff is nice because you

720
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,030
actually go into the class and again you

721
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,059
meet some people you interface with

722
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,059
people

723
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,510
but the online stuff you kinda have some

724
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,510
of that as well look for social or

725
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,520
professional networking events like

726
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,820
network after work

727
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,320
those are great because again you get to

728
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,549
meet more people you might even meet

729
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,918
some people in the area where you're

730
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:28,379
working and now you've got a reason to

731
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,600
go out you know and leave the hotel and

732
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,830
get dinner you might even make some

733
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,860
friends and make some more connections

734
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,210
with other companies and then your

735
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,439
project manager is gonna be like yeah

736
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,330
you should try to sell them on some

737
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,330
services because that's what they do

738
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:51,720
last but not least take your PTO does

739
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:57,090
anybody in here feels like they can't

740
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,299
take PTO guys in the back yeah I get

741
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,299
that a lot

742
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,799
because if I take PTO nobody's doing my

743
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:06,360
work for me it's just gonna be there

744
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,190
when I get done or whenever I get back

745
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,459
from vacation it's gonna be there

746
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,230
waiting for me and a lot of people feel

747
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,360
like they lose their momentum if they

748
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,750
don't take their PTO or like guilted

749
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,320
almost into not taking it you have it

750
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:26,070
for a reason get away from the job site

751
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,070
I like to disconnect for five days in

752
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,510
August I go out to northern Michigan I

753
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:34,559
have a place that I like to go to out

754
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:36,750
there no phone no laptop no kids just me

755
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,120
and my dog and then I've got a backpack

756
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,510
with a hammock and a few other supplies

757
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,729
and that's it there it is a no tech week

758
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,129
and it's just a time to kind of recharge

759
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,450
my own batteries I would highly

760
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,320
recommend that if that's your thing if

761
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,929
it's not your thing

762
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:57,178
don't go out in the woods it's not it's

763
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:58,710
not gonna work out okay there's a big

764
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,510
difference between high brush

765
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,940
cranberries and the cranberries you get

766
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,960
at the grocery store part of that is you

767
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,440
know the amount of time you're gonna

768
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,789
spend with a bad stomach more life

769
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,620
lessons and maybe don't completely

770
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,919
disconnect because let's face it

771
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,850
if you have kids Pokemon go is life and

772
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,700
those eggs aren't going to hatch

773
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,649
themselves I have a little bracelet that

774
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,450
they make meat

775
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,360
everywhere with me so when I travel I

776
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:31,010
can catch them Pokemon from all over the

777
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,500
place so that that does happen any

778
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:45,320
questions at this point anybody might

779
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:50,620
have no is expecting a bit more all

780
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:52,790
right so what do you do if you actually

781
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:57,320
do want to make the jump to another

782
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,760
company one of my friends right now is

783
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,070
going through a situation where he did

784
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,350
have that non-compete clause and there

785
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,050
is legal action that was being taken

786
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,210
against him there are several services

787
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:10,940
that you can buy as a consultant to have

788
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,889
legal on demand if needed so if that

789
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,080
comes in it cost about five dollars a

790
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,509
month 217 dollars a month is what I've

791
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,060
seen for the range but it does protect

792
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,460
you and I don't want to turn this into

793
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,190
an advertisement for them but if you are

794
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,510
working in the field and we do

795
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,460
occasionally entertain some of these

796
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,870
offers I would strongly recommend it we

797
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,810
can talk about it afterwards if you'd

798
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,730
like to I don't want to totally give

799
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:38,570
them a plug they're not gonna pay me so

800
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,620
not gonna waste the time on that but

801
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,690
that's kind of where I want to leave it

802
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,520
for today if you have any questions

803
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,610
after the fact and want to come and talk

804
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,889
to me about it I'm here for the next

805
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,690
couple of days we can go you know grab a

806
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,389
drink or whatever and talk otherwise

807
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:55,610
I'll probably be in some of these other

808
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:58,109
talks thank you very much

809
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,110
[Applause]
