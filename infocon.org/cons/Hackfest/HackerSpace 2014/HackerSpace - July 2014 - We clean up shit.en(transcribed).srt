way from this stuff if you want to ask

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,190
questions go ahead along the way I mean

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,010
it's of course very informal so

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:01,399

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,399

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,089
clean up i'll talk about how big

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,350
incidents happen and what stuff you need

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,330
to deal with as organizations for some

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,919
of you and play time jobs at large

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,650
organizations and you know sometimes

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,390
it's not really nice stuff at asleep so

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,950
unpleasant dilemmas that you have to go

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,170
through as an organization when you with

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,540
a large incident and finally I'll end

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,860
with six loss or four shirts which I'm

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,750
sure it's good enough to make you all

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,759
very depressed and then we have a good

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,100
reason to go out and have beer you know

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,820
that's the purpose of the night right so

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,839
we'll go over the beer so yeah I'll wake

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,619
you up when i'm done with the

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,110
introductions i was born in 1973 and

38
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,970
that's the year that these cars roamed

39
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,430
the streets of the netherlands which is

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,500
where I'm from and the only reason I

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,390
have this slide is that if I previews

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,219
were one of my colleagues told me that I

43
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,560
bet you can't put a slide and picture of

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,329
a noble month on your presentation so

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,680
ever since then I put a picture on open

46
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,059
one time a presentation and this is

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,190
always there for people that know me

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,229
there's no this I always comes up this

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,079
is where I'm from it's a nice picture so

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,520
if you read

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,560
ugh limits of the Netherlands no

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,930
industry and windmills or we all know

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,520
how they're saying it if you're in

54
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,010
Neverland surround a plus a nice to see

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,810
flowers but you know it's also ugly at

56
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,670
times of course and we don't have as

57
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,350
much space as you guys here you can

58
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,299
drive for hours it's just light it

59
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,329
normally kind of animes with some stuff

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,260
about me but it's PDF so it doesn't work

61
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,060
where I normally tell you a little bit

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,250
about me and I've kids and then I like

63
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,710
to travel to places like India Malaysia

64
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,660
which are our wife strong I like to play

65
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,290
Bolivia how much spare time and learn

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,570
some chinese and of course most of all i

67
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,549
really love to do nothing which is what

68
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,049
i'm going to do the next two weeks here

69
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,950
in quebec you know we're going to do

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,209
nothing but it's really difficult

71
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,820
because you never know when you ready

72
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,860
change we doing nothing so I'll I've

73
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,720
included two slides about folks to make

74
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,970
our sales and marketing people have any

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,790
PL so I'm gonna so I joined folks about

76
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,800
two years ago and I'm responsible for

77
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,380
Fox hurt which is our commercial

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,180
instruments balls deep so I have a team

79
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,370
that basically sits around doing nothing

80
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,590
until people call us and they have

81
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,600
security incident at which time we don't

82
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,820
use this fan of course to head out

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,920
because organizations within insulin

84
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,930
don't really like this venom from front

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,420
door we do have one but it's also for

86
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,100
marketing of course so we we park it

87
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,899
outside security conferences and stuff

88
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,970
like that but if you have really

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,310
incidents we go out in our unmarked cars

90
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,500
and we speed along highways and for

91
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,239
getting planes and help our customers so

92
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,769
that's that's the work that I do it it's

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,660
it's sometimes boring it's sometimes

94
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,959
nice i have been really interesting

95
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,329
incidents I can't really talk about most

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,250
incidents you're naming organizations of

97
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,410
course because those things don't get

98
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,090
the public or hit the media but I can

99
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,829
tell you a lot of anecdotes during the

100
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,810
next I don't know what 45 minutes 1 hour

101
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,970
1 & a half hour two hours how many times

102
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,769
we need and once time you need so so

103
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,450
what are we talking about we're we're

104
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,760
protecting crown jewels right that's

105
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,160
what we're talking about so it could be

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,079
financial information customer data or

107
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,299
it could be systems that you know

108
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,280
support plans where it may affect your

109
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,750
cars and stuff if people attack those

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,668
parts of your organization it really

111
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,738
hurts in fact the thing that hurts the

112
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,049
most of course it's your primary process

113
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,609
so if you if you do process if you do

114
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,009
make lollies for example

115
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,659
if it process stops it really hurts oh

116
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,449
so that's what I customers experience in

117
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,979
terms and some examples this is a nice

118
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,250
one it happened about two years ago

119
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:37,419
where we got a call and we had to help

120
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,900
out an organization with the

121
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,758
investigation on their own internal

122
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,620
network but there was one complication

123
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,229
which was that there were no IT

124
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,810
personnel anymore so we got on the plane

125
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,280
I think we arrived on Sunday and our

126
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,439
assignment was really we had to

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,049
basically do an investigation so that's

128
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,590
regular forensics work make forensic

129
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,819
copy machines find certain data find out

130
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,039
what happened in certain circumstances

131
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,479
but the complication was that we didn't

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,878
have access to the network because there

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,409
was no IT personnel so normally if we do

134
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,840
an investigation of course we have local

135
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,219
people helping us giving us access and

136
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,049
providing us information about which

137
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,180
systems do what where we can find which

138
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,340
information in this case it wasn't there

139
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,259
the organization was still running but

140
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,900
there were no IT personnel so our first

141
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,090
assignment excludes heck into our own

142
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,609
network and then do the investigation so

143
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,198
you're right from on Sunday and somebody

144
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,870
opened the office for us on sunday

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,849
around noon and at three p.m. three

146
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,729
hours later we were the main admin and

147
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:39,460
we can start a real work and it's kinda

148
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,378
nice twist you know because another part

149
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,779
of the organization that I work for fox

150
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,430
IT also does penetration testing so of

151
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,409
course this is like combination of a

152
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,650
security incident with a penetration

153
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:51,639
test like a real relative example so

154
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,929
that's the kind of stuff that we're

155
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,029
dealing with another example is an

156
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,729
organization that had a part of a

157
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:00,219
department attacked in an entire men are

158
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,430
where some systems did this which is not

159
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:05,289
very nice they were basically destroyed

160
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,089
and which which interesting in itself of

161
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,650
course destruction rather than data

162
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,319
exfiltration is it's an interesting

163
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,210
thing so we went in and investigated

164
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,610
what happened there and it's really of

165
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,219
course it really hits you very hard if a

166
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,710
number of your systems don't do anything

167
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:21,819
at all anymore which is even worse then

168
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,948
you know what I'll tell you about later

169
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,050
strange science but everything still

170
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,610
runs because of course if you have if

171
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,610
you have a Chinese in your network or

172
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,469
America's your network will run as never

173
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,940
before you know you will not notice that

174
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,610
anything is wrong because it will work

175
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,360
fine but in this case you didn't go to

176
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,000
make stays

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,180
is actually urban spy well known this

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,150
was last summer where the largest

179
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,960
Belgian telecom actually found out that

180
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:53,438
they kind of had an unsuspected cloud

181
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,210
backup of their data you know actually

182
00:06:53,439 --> 00:07:00,879
redundant we went in and investigated a

183
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,568
case where strange stuff happened on the

184
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,879
network and we kind of helped the

185
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,530
organization cleaning up understanding

186
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,319
the attacker infrastructure seeing what

187
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,750
the attacker was after and helping them

188
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,270
create a plan to mitigate it to clean up

189
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,129
a network to make quite sure that the

190
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,279
attacker is gone I'll talk about it

191
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,990
quite sure later on because you can

192
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,270
answer and the interesting thing here is

193
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,159
that on the Monday after the weekend

194
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,568
that they cleaned this organization put

195
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,090
out a press release saying that they had

196
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,189
been the victim of an attack and that

197
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,330
they had cleaned their network and that

198
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,150
they were going back to business as

199
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,639
usual and on Friday or the same week

200
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,589
there Spiegel the German newspaper

201
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,620
published an article with some Snowden

202
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:47,259
documents and there were GCSU slides

203
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,000
that mentioned an operation socialist

204
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,279
and it actually mentions the

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,740
organization that we helped by name so

206
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,110
if you ask me in a court of law it will

207
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,839
not be suspicious sufficient proof but

208
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,400
if you ask me those worry guys that we

209
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,469
saw on the network and those are

210
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,339
exciting exciting investigations with

211
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,449
this data power really nice stuff and

212
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,270
lastly I think you may have heard this

213
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,069
one also we kinda did you know dark

214
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,289
about what was it to half years ago

215
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,539
anybody familiar with this these typical

216
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:20,080
30 that contact this was a Dutch

217
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,219
organization in a really small place in

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,688
the Netherlands that provided

219
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,169
certificates you know like DKI

220
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,199
certificates but mainly they provided

221
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,500
them to the Ducks government for dutch

222
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,810
government authentication processes you

223
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,240
know so that was quite impactful and

224
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,159
they realized at one point that they had

225
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,589
been the victim of an attack and they

226
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,169
perform investigation well everything

227
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,940
was over and that was in july and later

228
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,779
that year i think in at the end of

229
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,130
august somebody in iran by accident

230
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,990
because i use google chrome

231
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,030
google chrome warned them that the

232
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,310
Google certificate wasn't actually you

233
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,770
know I think it was not verizon you know

234
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,869
that issue did but it was dizzy not her

235
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,160
that wasn't supposed to be the case

236
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,930
right but it's only because of

237
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,469
certificate pinning by google chrome

238
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:11,170
that this random user somewhere in iran

239
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,670
found out any posted on a google forum

240
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,199
saying it guys good this is what I've

241
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,420
seen is this normal what's happening

242
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,300
here and that's what started the ball

243
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,430
rolling and Fox ID was involved

244
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,550
investigation in turn out that didja

245
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,800
notre was pretty heavily bombed and be

246
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,089
investigating that they read earlier

247
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,740
didn't turn up all the details and it

248
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,740
turned out that many many many more

249
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,070
fraudulent certificates were issued

250
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,740
among which Google stood so we can only

251
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,100
guess why I think Google certificate

252
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,500
shows up in Iran right where an ISP has

253
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,180
a thank Google certificate which allows

254
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,440
that I speech basically men in the

255
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,300
middle all the traffic and read

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,310
everybody's mail and whatever we can

257
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,270
only guess what happened there and what

258
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,589
happened there is probably much worse

259
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,390
than what happened in the Netherlands

260
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,040
because in the Netherlands we have to

261
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,540
revoke your certificate and it was a big

262
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,459
impact I work for the government at the

263
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,490
time I didn't work at rocks idea and

264
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,410
it's it's amazing that you realize that

265
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,660
nobody knows we certificates they use

266
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,740
and where and what the impact is and you

267
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,050
first think that it's maybe about

268
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,670
visiting websites and then you realize

269
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,219
no it's not just about visiting websites

270
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:19,449
it's about lawyers exchanging sign

271
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,790
documents it's about a length landscape

272
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,790
authority that cannot issue information

273
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,199
about which which lines go where so

274
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,630
people cannot dig it around it's like

275
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,030
really impactful you know but I think it

276
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,860
it's dwarfed by what happened in Iran I

277
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,810
think we can only get if you want to

278
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,700
read about that there's a fox at the

279
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,130
report called black job if you google

280
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,750
that you'll nice report to read it it's

281
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,010
it's actually we made it for the

282
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,620
government and that's government a

283
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,960
listed so it's rare an investigation

284
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,940
report of a serious incident such as

285
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,750
this one is actually published so it's

286
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,760
completely pilot it's nice in August

287
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,530
course normally we also have

288
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,180
non-disclosure agreements and we still

289
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,860
do so I can't say anything more than in

290
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,510
the report but it's an I should work

291
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,920
week so those are the things that we

292
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,189
want to avoid actually you don't want

293
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,560
GCHQ in your network

294
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,290
right we don't want to be hacked by what

295
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,969
maybe you run or whatever you don't want

296
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,819
those things but sometimes they happen

297
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,280
what do you do what customers call us

298
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,050
and they usually have no idea and it

299
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,390
starts out very small right so we need

300
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,130
to help them basically they call us and

301
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,600
the question is help we have something

302
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,210
strange going on the network and we have

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,770
no idea what it so help us find out find

304
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,050
out what it is and sometimes could be in

305
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,630
some things and as well and also we head

306
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,540
out to the bus so so how does an

307
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,430
incident work of course every incident

308
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,990
is different so if you want to prepare

309
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,459
all talk about preparation let's roll it

310
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,780
doesn't make a lot of sense they're all

311
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,610
kind of scenarios ready because

312
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,839
everything is going to be different any

313
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,840
crisis is going to be the head of a

314
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,510
silly my model other prices can write or

315
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,330
throwing their if you are you're a bit

316
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,160
nippy but anyway it's a camel because it

317
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,500
usually starts out small right so you

318
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,930
see something like a camel's nose behind

319
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,570
the curtains that you they kind of maybe

320
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,699
a log file that rotates very quickly or

321
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,410
it's it's it's a server crashing you

322
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,060
know stuff like that it kind of started

323
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,100
digging and you you pull the nose and

324
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,650
out comes this camel is huge animal and

325
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,240
it turns out to be really big sorry end

326
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,829
up in the camels and this is the crisis

327
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,860
right when a crisis can be like anywhere

328
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,710
from a few hours or a few days or we

329
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,810
have even had prices of weeks where we

330
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,610
have people on site for weeks and months

331
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,060
because you don't know what's going on

332
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,590
and at one point you realize all right

333
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,150
we've managed to crisis right we kind of

334
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,890
know what's going on we know how to fix

335
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,740
this incident we go back to business as

336
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,560
usual and I've always worn our customers

337
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,880
when we come in I was born a customer

338
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,520
that you know by the time you go out of

339
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,200
crisis mode and we kind of SB close the

340
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,240
door and say well you know yet to clean

341
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,370
up we can help you with a strategy to

342
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,130
improve stuff but there's like a big

343
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,660
mountain of work waiting for you you'll

344
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,490
be dealing with law enforcement you'll

345
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,319
be dealing with regulators calcio

346
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,000
regulators financial regulators you'll

347
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,360
be dealing with insurance companies

348
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,520
there will be work to do for years and

349
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,660
in the case of the incidents you'll have

350
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,819
work to do for years I'm not

351
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,170
exaggerating but even small incidents

352
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,300
know if your visitor for a few days

353
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,339
you'll still be working for weeks

354
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,400
afterwards to improve stuff clean up

355
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,100
stuff do whatever you have to do because

356
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,500
open up a can of basically that are

357
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,290
delusional you want you were expecting

358
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,080
that so a lot about two solid phases of

359
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,329
what happens before I go into the more

360
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,680
difficult dilemmas as remind you if you

361
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,410
have questions or anything interrupt

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,390
because I know I talk past you want me

363
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,780
to slow down also tell me you know if

364
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,370
you want me to breathe more that's okay

365
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,930
so I'll talk about what happens when you

366
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,510
just detect something I'll talk about

367
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,250
what happens when the crisis is at it it

368
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,439
alters you know the hottest piece of

369
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,150
crisis and i'll talk about going back to

370
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,690
normal going back to business as usual

371
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,880
whatever that may mean because most

372
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,620
organizations like two hours before they

373
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,910
call us and you you tell them you have

374
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,800
something going on they'll laugh in your

375
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,770
face right because like 10 this could

376
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,930
never happen to us and it does happen to

377
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:08,230
most organizations at an unexpected time

378
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,449
that you're never as heck so and then

379
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,190
basically i'm i'm mainly referring to

380
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,760
two hacking incidents you know where you

381
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,390
have an external malicious actor

382
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,670
infiltrating your network and

383
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,060
exfiltrating data but of course it could

384
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,829
also be d dos attacks or you know like

385
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,310
the destructive attacks that i mentioned

386
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:30,100
before we have systems blue screening or

387
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,560
just very simple maybe sequel injection

388
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,990
with database flying out of your

389
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,869
organization through your blood systems

390
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,060
or just one web server owns you know be

391
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,790
all kind of sizes but the big the big

392
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,859
hacking incidents where yeah just like

393
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,599
really substantial amount with your

394
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,430
infrastructure owned those are pretty

395
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,270
serious and they're really not very nice

396
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,099
for relations that we help so of course

397
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,350
you make sense a pretty escalation is

398
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,480
crucial right book i always joke and

399
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,020
it's not really joke this friday is the

400
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,700
pièce de you know for my team at least

401
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,620
and if I step it's not because there's

402
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,900
always heck on Friday not at all it's

403
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,480
because many organizations you'll see

404
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,550
that they'll be you know investigating

405
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,350
something and somebody's going finding

406
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,510
out what's going on it already know and

407
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,330
time goes by and at one point it's like

408
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,550
well guys it's Friday so we can we don't

409
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,350
know what's going on and as long as you

410
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,699
don't know what's going on it's really

411
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,490
serious because it could be serious it

412
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,680
could be nothing like so i would say

413
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,580
avoid that and then they call

414
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,739
external party which at least around our

415
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,720
area is very often us now let's on

416
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,670
friday so i think it's crucial to

417
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,250
escalate quickly you need to you need to

418
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,290
get proper professional help if you need

419
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,089
it you know but it's not always obvious

420
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,920
that you need it if you don't escalate

421
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,270
it and it's very difficult choice

422
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,800
because you know sometimes people ask me

423
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,110
so how do you decide what to escalate

424
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,209
and what not to escalate and i think as

425
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,950
an organization if you do with many many

426
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,959
hundreds of incidents during a year

427
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,790
right there could be small ones it could

428
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,349
be all kind of alarms and i think it's

429
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,910
very important to categorized and your

430
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,740
bucket them into the known knowns you

431
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,329
know the know me incidents those you

432
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,399
have processed for if you have like a

433
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,899
zoo infection in your network it's very

434
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,670
simple that that thing doesn't really

435
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,880
spread internally normally so you clean

436
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,050
one machine you reissue certificates

437
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
that were compromised on the local

438
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,829
machine you have persons change all

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,899
their passwords that they use the net

440
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,580
machine and you're good to go right you

441
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,779
don't need to go into crisis mode but

442
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,850
sometimes you have stuff that you don't

443
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,620
understand and i think it especially the

444
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,420
things you don't understand that you

445
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,540
want to kind of informally escalate up a

446
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,610
little bit and you need to decide with

447
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,730
almost all information right so we've

448
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,779
had incidents where it took us almost

449
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:45,240
two weeks before people like seven days

450
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:47,400
a week before we actually knew what was

451
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,320
going on and that's quite long i think

452
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,790
you know it's it's it's it's finding a

453
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,709
needle in a haystack you know it's it's

454
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,900
fine you have some traces but you don't

455
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:56,729
really know what you're looking for so

456
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,079
if an attacker a truly sophisticated and

457
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,700
the attacker was in that case you can

458
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,740
take you a long time to really find out

459
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,420
what's going on and only when you

460
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,640
understand what's going on if you start

461
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,750
to build your picture of what is this

462
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,040
attacker after which is tennessee own

463
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,630
but most importantly is impacting the

464
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,309
basis right if you have a marketing

465
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,679
website somewhere that's own it's

466
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,030
probably pretty embarrassing it's

467
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,949
probably shitty as well because there's

468
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,480
customer information on it but it

469
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,780
doesn't impact your primary business

470
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,179
normal and marketing websites are known

471
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,620
to be i would say pretty bad you know

472
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,840
cause marketing websites need to be off

473
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,760
quickly you know they also they usually

474
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,830
involve customer privacy privacy

475
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,390
sensitive information you know but it

476
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,370
can be very expensive so playing

477
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,890
expensive turns out to be not very

478
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,178
secure right it could also be quicken

479
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,769
and

480
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,320
expensive and that is maybe more screw

481
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:48,090
so crisis teams nice we've been in many

482
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,230
situations and a crisis team in

483
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,509
basically a theme that comes together

484
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,730
every maybe a few hours or twice a day

485
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,919
to discuss the situation with input from

486
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,799
the technical investigation and see

487
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,840
which questions have been resolved then

488
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,879
what the direction we need to take every

489
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,559
monster the crisis but I've been in

490
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,090
situations where numbers we call it the

491
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,279
gorilla right there has to be somebody

492
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,949
at a table that can make decisions and

493
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,419
this sounds very obvious I know it is

494
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,730
very obvious but we've been in crisis

495
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,990
situation it's willow gorilla so you

496
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,269
have a bunch of people with different

497
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,369
interests you know business people

498
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,960
there's like security you know there's

499
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,610
all sorts of different people at

500
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,710
different interest and you can't get

501
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,539
reaching consensus or what to do right

502
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,669
in a crisis moment you can't beat your

503
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,289
consensus right you need the gorilla we

504
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,749
were also had places where we had two

505
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,269
gorillas interesting to me realize that

506
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:38,429
start to fight for the right decision

507
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,139
and you need somebody with a mandate it

508
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,210
won't boot process especially it's very

509
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:44,639
often it's security versus the business

510
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,159
right if you have a whole marketing site

511
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:48,899
are you going to take that one down or

512
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,249
are you going to leave it running of

513
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,049
course the security person you're going

514
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:53,610
to say you have to take it down but

515
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,929
business will say well we definitely be

516
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,639
running because I otherwise we'll

517
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,889
discuss this much money right so and

518
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,209
they will not be able to resolve that

519
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:03,178
theater so you need somebody with

520
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,100
mandate above where i would say

521
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,809
realistically i have always vote for the

522
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,699
most secure option right you can't

523
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,619
always go for more secure option be the

524
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,210
most secure option would be probably

525
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,158
stay in bed every morning we don't

526
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,539
choose that option because we get it

527
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,759
want to get stuff done right so in the

528
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,440
most extreme you can't always go for the

529
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,629
most eruption and that's that's

530
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,730
especially the line of work that we do

531
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:27,748
it's very often the case you can't just

532
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,490
you know for example if we've had cases

533
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,110
where in this it happens very often of

534
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,399
course where we have to investigate a

535
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,629
machine and the Machine happens not to

536
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,248
be in Europe but it happens to be

537
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:37,590
somewhere in India this is very common

538
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:38,789
it's not strange but it could also be

539
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,740
that that machine doesn't have a very

540
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:43,230
fast connection so what are you going to

541
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,779
do are you going to make a forensic copy

542
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,100
over like some put a crappy VPN

543
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,860
connection where you can just cover that

544
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,689
it's going to take you 18 hours and then

545
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,969
do your investigation on the forensic

546
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,370
copy no that doesn't work you can always

547
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,260
wait for a

548
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,510
so sometimes you don't go for the best

549
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,010
option a just say well I'm going to just

550
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,559
directly access the machine and do a

551
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,629
life investigation and I don't know how

552
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,280
that works in canada but i know in all

553
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,690
the leads that might stand in court you

554
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,660
know if you document why you've made

555
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,490
certain choices and you can't wait for

556
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,710
18 hours with an investigation so you'll

557
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,230
have to do a life investigation which is

558
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,730
less forensically sound that might work

559
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,070
and also you don't always go for the

560
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,710
best policy what is the best option but

561
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,600
maybe not the most secure option i

562
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,070
working it's a different thing so so you

563
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,540
had a little battle which is which is

564
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,510
crisis which can take anywhere from

565
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,309
hours or days or week and I've always

566
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,990
already mentioned it will be there will

567
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,330
be communication at the table read go

568
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,800
and communication is how all internal

569
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,990
ibid also external there will be

570
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,790
business whenever it makes the money at

571
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,460
the organization at the table and this

572
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,420
also goes for nonprofits in and

573
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,910
governments of course has just

574
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,679
commercial organizations then there's

575
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,050
technical investigation we were mostly

576
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,750
involved in that and legal very

577
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,940
important all talk about what what what

578
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,850
drives goes sorry missed again he should

579
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,830
say it's what we do is what we close

580
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,620
right oh we love ourselves a good

581
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,970
incident and it may be funny to say that

582
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,399
with a big smile but because our

583
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,710
organizations suffer and it is but it's

584
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,559
nice to be able to help organizations

585
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:18,440
actually overcome the incidents and of

586
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,120
course technically and professionally

587
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,850
speaking its challenge if you find

588
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,639
something new or unknown right so for my

589
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,639
guys the investigators they love a good

590
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,260
chance right but unfortunately for for

591
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,790
the organization that hit the technical

592
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,679
side of the investigation is really not

593
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,690
that important right the most important

594
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,390
thing it's like Oracle is a reputation

595
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,390
going to get hurt its customer data

596
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,550
breached or do we have to stop our

597
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,070
primary posts and stuff like that it's

598
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:48,260
important but it's not really technical

599
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,428
those things so what is technically is

600
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,020
of course it's need to find out what

601
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,990
happened and it's a very broad question

602
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,530
but you want to know which information

603
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,320
was accessed by a by a malicious

604
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:03,050
outsider or insider maybe or with

605
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,310
systems you know its systems that may be

606
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,290
due process control that's very

607
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,970
important as well now what's the impact

608
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,860
you know if certain information

609
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,600
access what's the impact do we need to

610
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,020
inform our customers to eat in for our

611
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,969
partners does it impact the integrity of

612
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,450
our information or only the availability

613
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,670
or exergy not like that and the attacker

614
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,580
perhaps indicates of compromise web

615
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,410
server did an attacker hold on to the

616
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,280
local network stuff like that we've had

617
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:33,680
in the investigation where it is like

618
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,480
it's funny mad right it's not funny that

619
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,460
it is funny now we've had an

620
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,640
investigation where there was a

621
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,830
compromise web server and it was really

622
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,170
really terrible not just once you know

623
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,730
what you you the company gets triggered

624
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,080
blew an investigation and were like all

625
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,820
sort to tell you but you've not only

626
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,889
been on yesterday or day before

627
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,310
yesterday whatever it was but also in

628
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,810
July in February in November you know

629
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,330
like three or four times in the last

630
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,950
year and their fly fishing site going on

631
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,020
that service is terrible terrible stuff

632
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,960
and even more terrible was that all

633
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,930
local all fire willing leading to like

634
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,600
the next the next TMZ was basically

635
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,980
non-existent if for some reason was

636
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,439
wrongly configured and it was like an

637
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,880
open highway you know so so if you

638
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,410
realize there's one machine which is

639
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,930
basically like a local pub you know

640
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,000
really nice everybody hangs out there on

641
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,230
the machine and with an open highway to

642
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,810
the next things that that's pretty scary

643
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,760
this organization has been very lucky

644
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,040
because we found no signs of any decent

645
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,650
compromise but it's scary stuff so

646
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,899
sometimes it turns out well do you know

647
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,310
the course I'm not always convinced that

648
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,190
knowing the cause of an incident is

649
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:42,020
helpful to be very honest I mean I know

650
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,850
you you'll see the statistics as well

651
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,810
it's our experience if you have like big

652
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:49,610
compromises you very often don't even

653
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,960
know how it happened you know it was

654
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,379
even attacker has been in your network

655
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,150
for half a year or a year or even longer

656
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,840
you're not going to have many traces of

657
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,480
that initial email with PDF or excel

658
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,790
sheet or whatever on it or you not going

659
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,490
to have any logs anymore that will tell

660
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,080
you that it was a compromiser for what

661
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,080
shirt somewhere i thought those loads

662
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,730
are usually gone after a year and then

663
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,159
in my experience many organizations

664
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:19,970
don't just have one way right they'll

665
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,180
have like 348 raising so it doesn't make

666
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,280
a lot of sense to me

667
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,710
to find out the specific course of that

668
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,690
one incident and try and fix plug that

669
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,980
hole because you'll plug that one hole

670
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,350
but you know if your scoot across

671
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,210
streets not that good it's not really

672
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,590
going to help that much you know so so

673
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,380
what we normally do is in the end of the

674
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,790
investigation we will give a list of

675
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,350
recommendations some stuff that we

676
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,690
recommend the organization to be proof

677
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,490
which are not directly related to the

678
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,410
incident right but it's more for general

679
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,180
if you want to improve your prove your

680
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,980
security you got to think of these

681
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,320
things unfortunately it usually includes

682
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,510
stuff like a second and it you know

683
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,460
right that's very you would call it

684
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,020
facing but it's very hard actually to do

685
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,900
that well across an organization it's

686
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,420
not that 18 years and this is also a

687
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,270
story that that is funny now but they

688
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,700
were really not very funny back then

689
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,650
during an investigation this is

690
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,670
something I hit that made it to the list

691
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,160
at the end list of recommendations

692
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,220
during the investigation it all went

693
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:21,360
well and saturday night we were last to

694
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,250
leave around 1-130 was with the customer

695
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,379
first customer went out one way we went

696
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,960
out through parking parking lot or

697
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,760
parking basement now it's gone and then

698
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,080
my colleague next morning I right there

699
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,640
at night you know suddenly morning nine

700
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,800
o'clock i'm there are colleagues not

701
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,570
there but I see not here what happened

702
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,320
you know something must be wrong and he

703
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,389
he shows up at like 1030 names like okay

704
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,760
angry you know like I have a hard time

705
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,370
but he lost his parking ticket you know

706
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,320
the way he came in so he drove up to the

707
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,000
entrance in he rang the bell and it's

708
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,980
connected him to an alarm central that

709
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,140
no longer served at farming basement

710
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,120
sorta like I'm sorry sir I can't help

711
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,070
you they try to the other exit same

712
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,389
thing and he's like he like stuck stuck

713
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,360
in the parking garage you know I'd like

714
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,100
130 or this Saturday night any other way

715
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,260
for somebody from the apartment building

716
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,730
above that happened to comment I don't

717
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,590
know what time it was what he was fuming

718
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,100
by there you know that's why didn't you

719
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,470
call me know ah this kind of thing could

720
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,060
happen to us there holy also this is a

721
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,490
lot of preparation of course it it's

722
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,350
shocking that you'll have a pretty big

723
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,240
organization that doesn't have this

724
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,600
in order for a fee but it's funny how

725
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,160
everybody able to be there all so talk

726
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,429
about communication communication is

727
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,630
actually very important

728
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,300
any case it's not just about

729
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,160
communicating by a press releases to

730
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,250
your customers or resolve whatever but

731
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,930
communication is I would consider

732
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,640
everything outside of your crisis team

733
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,080
you should consider external

734
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,060
communication really because you never

735
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,860
know when it hits the outside world

736
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,050
right so if there's something you don't

737
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,370
want people to know which happens you

738
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,110
know because you don't maybe you don't

739
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,360
have conclusive evidence yet or whatever

740
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,979
that might be very good and group more

741
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,899
for reasons why I don't want people to

742
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,390
know yet so if uniform people there's

743
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,190
also give more reasons why I don't tell

744
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,720
people to know yet but of course if you

745
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,670
don't want people to know yet don't talk

746
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,120
outside of the crisis team and for

747
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,140
example we've have seen cases where

748
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,909
organizations make like frequently asked

749
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,560
questions list and there's one for

750
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,210
journalists and one for customers and

751
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,010
this is really nice because I'm making

752
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,900
like why don't you think that

753
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,730
journalists good D customers order

754
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,080
generally could pretend to be customers

755
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,670
so they can find out if the different

756
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,399
answers in both lists doesn't make a lot

757
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,440
of sense right so don't compress and

758
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,870
you'll be lucky if you have been

759
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,010
initiated right we've also had actually

760
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,679
in Neverland see what's quite

761
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,690
fashionable for a while to actually do

762
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,270
kind of responsible disclosure but

763
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,430
through the press and then a journalist

764
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,050
who pull up an organization say well my

765
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,490
sources told me that that you have this

766
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,879
problem here I give you two hours to

767
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,740
respond which there's a whole story

768
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,660
about responsible service or making over

769
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,730
beer we can discuss that but i think

770
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,960
that's not the most responsible when you

771
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,500
call me about it you know if you have a

772
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,330
sequel injection bug your website and

773
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,040
that's the way we form the organization

774
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,260
they'll have a crisis immediately

775
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,570
because me doesn't involved and I mean

776
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,430
that's not the most effective way to fix

777
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,510
one secretly injection Park you know

778
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,960
even though I can understand the

779
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,160
frustration of people that want to that

780
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,140
find something I want to help

781
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,370
organizations and the end up getting

782
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,680
arrested you know I understand all that

783
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,830
but did that is not the best way to

784
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,080
enough to help opinion so breasts are

785
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,360
they would press crisis to communication

786
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,490
is about normally being the first to

787
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,350
communicate right if you know something

788
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,690
you better bring it out you don't have

789
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,280
to air all your dirty laundry but you

790
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,980
have to tell the public that something's

791
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,410
going on and find the right moment for

792
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,780
that don't speculate of course you know

793
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,180
and if you want one thing I find it very

794
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,639
that Enterprise communication theories

795
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,350
and there's like different strategies

796
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,520
you can choose right to communicate in

797
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,860
crises and there's one that's like

798
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,870
victims Red Sea I don't know all the

799
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,520
details but they can sense you basically

800
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,439
if knows where the Hicks if an

801
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,879
earthquake hits that's what you can do

802
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,590
right because it happens you there's

803
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,810
really nothing much you could have done

804
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,669
right so you're in a crisis and then

805
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,070
it's like well this thing happened to us

806
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,210
an interesting thing is that I realize

807
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,030
that many organizations kind of

808
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,130
automatically go into victim mode at

809
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:21,100
least internally sometimes when they are

810
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,180
the victim / / heck and I understand

811
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,500
because you are the victim of a hack but

812
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,150
the interesting thing is that the public

813
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,740
doesn't know what to think that way

814
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,420
right you might say we've been hacked

815
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,850
but the public will also say perhaps

816
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,170
truthfully so rightfully so well you

817
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,120
probably didn't have your in order

818
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,440
you know so it wasn't really totally of

819
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,570
course somebody's not supposed to ask

820
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,090
you but maybe you didn't even secure

821
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,800
your stuff well so and in situations

822
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,820
where the public perception is different

823
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,889
than your own it's used to be best

824
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,899
involved public perception as well so

825
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,580
victim strategy during crisis

826
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,370
communication is not very good in case

827
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,960
or 4x stable or so you can think of

828
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,850
internal external partners everything

829
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,980
you'll be surprised how many

830
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,510
organizations find out about about

831
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,160
partners that they have to deal with

832
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,500
suddenly during during a crisis that

833
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,930
they never realized you know and how do

834
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,640
you have you read such people everything

835
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,500
you say in public of course could have a

836
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,400
legal impact so you really go to

837
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:15,070
consider that well and talk about

838
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,400
customers basically they want to hear

839
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,929
the truth makes a lot of sense and they

840
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,950
want to know what to do you know hope

841
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:26,350
and it's not always obvious I think this

842
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,300
is not very easy we usually look at

843
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,129
customer communication as well who's

844
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,980
required you know experience in what

845
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,140
works and what doesn't but it's not easy

846
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,170
to do and of course your customers are

847
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:42,580
not all like you know IT experts most of

848
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,890
them are not and even worse sometimes if

849
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,379
you're secure website was like

850
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,050
temporarily infected with malware or it

851
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,100
had more effort Iseman on it what are

852
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,399
you going to tell your customers you

853
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,980
know scan with a virus scanner and then

854
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,650
what we all know that more it'll find

855
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,610
nothing you know Chris most most banking

856
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,190
Trojans

857
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,959
which is the stuff that being advertised

858
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,120
through advertising networks if they're

859
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,650
infected most bang controls will not be

860
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,959
found by virus scanners for the first

861
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,850
few weeks you know so what are you going

862
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,150
to tell your customers I know the truth

863
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,620
I had something happen at home a few

864
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,390
weeks back my wife said you know I

865
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,709
actually have to click this link and I

866
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,020
don't think it's very smart idea and I

867
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,450
said it probably wasn't and I was

868
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,879
thinking like how am I going to find out

869
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,040
where I'm infected you know I don't even

870
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,600
bother you know I just reinstall the

871
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,030
whole thing but you might want to find

872
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,240
out but it's just I probably bother

873
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,860
normally if we knew I individual

874
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
investigations of machines it's going to

875
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,678
easily take a day you know before you

876
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,080
really understand force unless you have

877
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,390
good leads it could be very quick but if

878
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,799
you don't have beliefs if you don't know

879
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,900
what happened but you suspect something

880
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,549
has happened on the machine it can we

881
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,790
take quite a long time to investigate so

882
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,230
so if you if you communicate at all the

883
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,990
interesting thing is that people of

884
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,790
course if you say ah we're company X

885
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,710
we've been here we're folks ID we've

886
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,320
been hacked yesterday guess what happens

887
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,780
you know half the world is going to fire

888
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,639
up you know Nessus or whatever and do a

889
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,980
little scary few as well as you Danny

890
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,049
have any gaping holes so if you start

891
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,419
communicating you better be damn sure

892
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,790
that you that you don't have any gaping

893
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,890
holes so you do me to do some emergency

894
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,840
pen testing in our view before you

895
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,720
communicated and we have seen that going

896
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,178
wrong we're an organization put out a

897
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,400
press release in them and fortunately

898
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,860
usually those things on hit the big news

899
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,049
but somebody wanna like secured for will

900
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,820
say haha I've also found this you know

901
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,799
it's Darrell you don't have to deal with

902
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,399
that so the role watches and scans with

903
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,139
you really nice legal I talked about

904
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,179
that a little bit let me see are going

905
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:51,070
for time off an hour ago so nice is

906
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,410
there any disclosure you need to do we

907
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,260
need to involve law enforcement or certs

908
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,000
you know anybody really would search for

909
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,090
national search you have them all over

910
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,130
the best course liability insurance all

911
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,870
that kind of stuff you don't use mean

912
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,490
involve themselves with that very often

913
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,139
there's a lot of you come to bear here

914
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,590
in fact those laws that apply to you

915
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,360
it's expanded not very nice if because

916
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,870
we do always raise this topic like we've

917
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,370
become

918
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,379
typing there's a few things we say we'd

919
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,510
say when we are done you have a lot of

920
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,790
stuff to do do you want to involve long

921
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,470
cord from the internal or not sure yet

922
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,870
but you know this changes our way

923
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,490
working somewhat you know if something

924
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,739
needs to be admissible evidence in court

925
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,090
you have to be no we're slightly

926
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,980
different than if you just want to get

927
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,209
things done and you know the most

928
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,550
important thing is to get it over with

929
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,590
you know another thing is like do you

930
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,659
have any mandatory disclosure laws

931
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,010
applicable to you to your business so if

932
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,420
that's the moment that we raise then

933
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,510
still need to find out it's a little bit

934
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,530
late those are things that you can

935
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,679
actually quite easily find out

936
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,090
beforehand so talk much information you

937
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,550
need to finally the information is where

938
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,309
which system do what and it's nice

939
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,960
because we always go outside and we

940
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:00,610
almost always plays like network

941
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,920
equipment network sensor so that we can

942
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,959
actually see live network traffic that's

943
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,150
the best way to investigate what happens

944
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,389
if an attacker is still inside or if you

945
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,010
might return but of course it helps us

946
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,419
to know what the network looks like you

947
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,460
know so we ask for network network

948
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,980
drawings and stuff like that and usually

949
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,300
its case of well you know here's this

950
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,090
drawing but it kind of looks like a

951
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,129
drawing of 1649 it's a bit outdated you

952
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,020
know but you know it kind of does trick

953
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,639
and then that's the same everywhere you

954
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,290
know I don't claim that any organization

955
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:34,990
can ever aim to have a hundred percent

956
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:37,300
you know flew be representative network

957
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,250
math doesn't work there's always

958
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,659
machines that you find where we will

959
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,010
find machines there investigate like

960
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,179
what is this machine do when they're

961
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,669
like wasn't supposed to be there anymore

962
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,490
all right Phillip still lives like maybe

963
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:50,230
migrated and department a doesn't feel

964
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,790
responsible anymore Department be

965
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,290
doesn't know it's responsible and the

966
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,659
Machine just sits there and becomes like

967
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,970
a honey pot caterpillar doesn't get best

968
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,030
anymore sometimes very going very cool

969
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,470
so that's that's normal in larger

970
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,570
organizations that that's the way it

971
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,040
happens you know same with matches you

972
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,660
can be you can aim to be good at

973
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,370
matching and I think you should because

974
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,529
it's a prevented messages really work

975
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:14,859
that we work well but you will never be

976
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,300
represent so anyway Janey's two systems

977
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,980
I'm going to talk about something else

978
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,810
that's I think for a larger organization

979
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,550
even small amounts as times that people

980
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,500
as know exactly what they should and

981
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,450
shouldn't do during the first hours of

982
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,530
an unknown incident and what you

983
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,779
shouldn't do makes a lot

984
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,820
sensing over don't our of machines

985
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,250
because memory is gone there's very

986
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,840
valuable trace in memory sometimes don't

987
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,180
start installing security patches

988
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,910
because you say oh it's outdated no

989
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,790
because you override may be valuable

990
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,160
crazy people do those things people and

991
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,529
sometimes maybe you suspect that people

992
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,850
might do it because they maybe they feel

993
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,190
that did something wrong by not passing

994
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,290
machine so they'll fetch it anyway after

995
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,620
they find out something with it come

996
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:58,000
prove it so you need need to be sure

997
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,370
that you could it's basically leaving

998
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,080
machine running and you know to para

999
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,609
memory dump you know who the proper

1000
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,830
image and then maybe you can check it

1001
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,360
out you know but you might want to

1002
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,520
preserve as many traces as you can

1003
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,790
before you start you know it's the same

1004
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,009
with investigation after a fire right or

1005
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:17,529
after a plane crash stuff like that you

1006
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,520
stop moves about it betray our to arrive

1007
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:23,290
to investigate so and you need to know

1008
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,820
of course how the impact your servers

1009
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:30,580
and when approaches a file and then you

1010
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,140
go away from normal and I don't know

1011
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,779
what normal means actually because

1012
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,080
honestly if you if you've had like GCHQ

1013
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,210
network for a year that was normal so

1014
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,710
what do you have to take them out you go

1015
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,350
back to better than normal maybe you

1016
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,210
know so so what does not only I don't

1017
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,460
know I don't know what of course normal

1018
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,560
means that you at least think you have

1019
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,240
that unknown crisis which is something

1020
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
that happened out of the blue it had an

1021
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,000
unknown impact that you kind of know

1022
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,170
what the impact is you kind of know how

1023
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,420
to get rid of it right you don't know

1024
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:03,520
how to keep the guy up so that's kind of

1025
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:07,050
normal and you got a good system back

1026
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,790
online maybe you gotta go to reinstall

1027
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,590
you're going to be in full of good data

1028
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,570
that can be can be quite difficult

1029
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,700
actually people out of the things work

1030
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:17,830
you got to do risk assessments and of

1031
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,830
course this is a nice i already

1032
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,779
mentioned the day to do list and i am

1033
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,720
also realized right i don't i don't

1034
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,490
pretend that the list that we give you

1035
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,600
is the ultimate list after which you

1036
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,600
have nothing left to do

1037
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,380
you

1038
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,520
items on if you know someone who

1039
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,500
provides of civic somewhere a bit more

1040
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,000
fluffy and cloud you know like bigger

1041
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,700
things that you could interpret in many

1042
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,070
ways but you know how I would be happy

1043
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,270
if you at least read each of them kind

1044
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,770
of decide what do you want to do

1045
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,180
something with it and then it called it

1046
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,460
says I'm not going to do it that's fine

1047
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,930
you know but at least decide actively if

1048
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,130
you're going to do it but I know you're

1049
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,899
not going to do all those things you an

1050
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,360
extra you go to five or six or something

1051
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,330
and I've actually seen people get

1052
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:10,410
physically sick during incense and

1053
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:11,580
that's that's also why this is something

1054
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,460
that really happening that looks quite a

1055
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,390
bit last year you know it's like they're

1056
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,520
people that actually involved to

1057
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,080
journalists and if your if your

1058
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,420
organization it's not that big and

1059
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,700
you're personally very involved and from

1060
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,840
from the moment nothing happens to the

1061
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,189
journalist calls you and your

1062
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,590
intermediate crisis right you're

1063
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:31,470
handling media and stuff and it because

1064
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,030
are very not insignificant but you know

1065
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,580
in the grand scheme of things maybe not

1066
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:39,390
that big of a deal then you know people

1067
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:41,040
get physically sick see people it is not

1068
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,379
very nice no it's not worth it i think

1069
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,150
so d the responsible disclosure nice

1070
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,670
discussion to have you know how do you

1071
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,470
inform an organization of flaws that you

1072
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,140
find I heard a podcast the other day

1073
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:54,600
where risky business were a guy in

1074
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,879
Australia actually 16 year old guy on

1075
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,370
reported a pretty serious thing of the

1076
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,320
Victoria local government or something

1077
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,330
that had a flaw or you could basically

1078
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,350
he said object direct reference for I

1079
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,200
think the website you could just

1080
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:10,080
download been 600,000 people's worth of

1081
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,669
data enough so he reported it over

1082
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,350
Christmas nobody reacted because

1083
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,000
government Christmas you know nothing

1084
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,950
happened he went through the media like

1085
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,930
3-4 days later they published it and

1086
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,730
it's like a big thing but in the end he

1087
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,520
got stuff on a hand which i think for a

1088
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,810
six-year-old kid probably that I don't

1089
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,000
know what you guys did when you were 16

1090
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:30,330
what I did I probably don't tell you so

1091
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,740
so anyway I learned my lesson Jeff so if

1092
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,910
you want to prepare for all those things

1093
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,399
I think the most important thing is

1094
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,170
where you food right if you work through

1095
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,640
the weekend and we work quite a few

1096
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,470
weekends if you work through the weekend

1097
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,319
do you want to have good food you don't

1098
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,700
want to be stuck with bad food you want

1099
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,940
to feel good as person you know so maybe

1100
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,430
not this one but anyway maybe not this

1101
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,980
one there is only expected father's

1102
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,868
home what is important I said you don't

1103
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,309
need to make a lot of scenarios right

1104
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,720
doesn't make a lot of sense what are we

1105
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:01,050
going to do if this system gets hacker

1106
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,308
or what if they do fishing techniques or

1107
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,579
why orgy doesn't make a lot of sense

1108
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:07,650
what you do is you know is crisis plan

1109
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:09,180
involves you know what are we going to

1110
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,890
do with steps are we going to take who

1111
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,078
is going to be involved how are we going

1112
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,940
to reach them you know which process are

1113
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,109
we going to follow that's very basic it

1114
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,880
doesn't need to take a lot of time to

1115
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:19,410
set it up it's very easy to text once or

1116
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,720
twice a year yeah doesn't need to go to

1117
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,910
talk money gives you a lot of insight if

1118
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,399
you would try to test twice a year of

1119
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,200
like a fake egg attack and you can

1120
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,450
follow the prices plan you might easily

1121
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,629
find out that well maybe we don't really

1122
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,279
have a contract actually deal with this

1123
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:38,400
cloud provider in the weekend you know

1124
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,079
we've had that happen oh maybe we've had

1125
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,609
this happen is welded oh my god we

1126
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,339
didn't even know this data was under

1127
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:46,650
Europe not bad not good you know so it's

1128
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:49,680
all these things that even with a little

1129
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,910
fast you can find out and this kind of

1130
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,098
stuff you know your most important

1131
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,690
information project customer system and

1132
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,510
practice like I said once twice a year

1133
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,130
it's nice to run it a drill kind of all

1134
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,440
the things that drew needs do it will

1135
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,680
happen you might find out a few of them

1136
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,880
beforehand so what gives you a

1137
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,109
stomachache the thing is if you realize

1138
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,400
that you're dealing with something that

1139
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:16,529
you can't fix yourself and that is quite

1140
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,559
often the case in fact because even if

1141
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:21,630
you have one owned web server if you're

1142
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,160
not if you're not somebody that that

1143
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,619
investigates security instruments

1144
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,839
regularly it's not that easy always to

1145
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,700
find out what happened and I don't know

1146
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,529
we'll talk about that later what you

1147
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,240
guys do but you know if you have if you

1148
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,510
do it once in a while it becomes easier

1149
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,000
but if you're a sysadmin and you you

1150
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,740
don't do investigations it's not easy to

1151
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,319
find out what happened on a system from

1152
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,379
scrutiny right so but sometimes we need

1153
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:48,029
outside help sometimes it's us who are

1154
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,609
you going to call and this is something

1155
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,950
that's interesting in 12 you you

1156
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,109
basically need to trust you notice i go

1157
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,089
to the doctor right if you don't trust

1158
00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:00,119
your own doctor you better not go there

1159
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:01,500
right so really you know why would you

1160
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,980
go to your doctor if you don't trust him

1161
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,020
you know

1162
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,140
turn around say thanks for the advice I

1163
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,270
won't follow it No so if you if you get

1164
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,640
outside help if you ask if you call an

1165
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,750
organization such as ours you really

1166
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,420
need to trust us because we'll be

1167
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,640
looking into your target secrets really

1168
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,859
you know we'll be looking at low see all

1169
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,600
kind of stuff you know that see what

1170
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:24,180
kind of bad stuff in it's not configured

1171
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,790
correctly or whatever you know so so it

1172
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,160
makes sense to talk those organizations

1173
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,630
before stuff goes wrong so that you know

1174
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,770
how you can reach them and what if you

1175
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,480
actually you know maybe you talk about

1176
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,320
you don't like a squat it's good you

1177
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,030
know what the thing you don't need to

1178
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,619
call us maybe you talk about you like us

1179
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,660
that's good you call it you know so I

1180
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,420
think it's very important you have to

1181
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,910
make a leap of faith and it does i think

1182
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,650
pay off to invest some time beforehand

1183
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,750
then you do see at least the larger than

1184
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,390
larger organizations think about that

1185
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,130
and subcontracts even you know to have

1186
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:56,040
somebody on a retainer to be able to

1187
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,920
call them in case of incident because

1188
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,230
it's traumatic and it is like being a

1189
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,500
doctor that slices you open and look at

1190
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:07,050
your internals so and would be coming

1191
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,210
and it could be a small incidents where

1192
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,300
is difficult see they're like army tents

1193
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:15,119
right army tents set up so it is one so

1194
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,890
we come in you know with with we need

1195
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,300
small incident it's like two people and

1196
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,490
sometimes we could be there with eight

1197
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,290
and we have like a war room for us you

1198
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,549
know which is like just tables and

1199
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:27,210
they're just people sitting there going

1200
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:30,180
be so live no sort of you know but so if

1201
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,890
you coming as a as a I know as a

1202
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,020
customer you say look what are we doing

1203
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,390
you know that's also a matter of what

1204
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,490
are these guys doing here really they

1205
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,290
could be doing I don't know minesweeper

1206
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,529
all day you don't know how long does it

1207
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:46,020
take to investigate in system right so

1208
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:48,180
it takes a lot of trust I would say to

1209
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,460
get outside help in a situation where

1210
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,890
you're totally not in control and you

1211
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,740
basically give us control to give you

1212
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,390
the answers and if it it may sound a bit

1213
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,549
silly now but it's really not that easy

1214
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,350
for an organization to hand over that

1215
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,930
control and say well I'm going to trust

1216
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,759
you to provide me the answers right if

1217
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,529
this is got these armies with these

1218
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,630
flight cases we come in and we set up

1219
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,010
like like you know local NASA's and

1220
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,050
stuff and it's cuz we've got like a room

1221
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,720
full of stuff you know it's like people

1222
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,430
started like it's like it's like a

1223
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,109
room but what are these guys doing it

1224
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,700
also that that takes trust and I think

1225
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:22,560
this is something that can be give

1226
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,368
people you know a stomachache you know

1227
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,900
what it is we are a commercial search

1228
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:29,849
you know so you're as a customer you

1229
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,500
girls think if your purpose is not to

1230
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,780
fix my problem as soon as possible but

1231
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,720
they get long as possible right good

1232
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,400
though that that all takes to our

1233
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,290
solution to that because I think a lot

1234
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,660
of it falls on our shoulders is to be

1235
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,930
extra smart as possible about what we do

1236
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,660
so that includes like at least daily

1237
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,180
overviews of things that we've done

1238
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,490
investigated results with weekly reviews

1239
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,580
as well and daily talks with especially

1240
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:59,459
in the bigger cases right when we do

1241
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,980
strive our best you know to give our

1242
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,490
customers insight into what we do and

1243
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:08,400
what we achieve for them and we've had

1244
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,259
cases where earlier on the investigation

1245
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,060
we said we know we think you need to

1246
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,920
look there as well and they're like well

1247
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,590
we don't think so you know it's just not

1248
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,869
worth the effort and like well it's a

1249
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:22,320
gut feeling you know but and it turned

1250
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:24,119
out you're right and so but I can

1251
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,890
understand that if an external company

1252
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,150
that makes money or I'm incident says

1253
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,830
what you need to look there as well you

1254
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,260
could say well you know I don't know why

1255
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:33,810
you're saying that but I would say with

1256
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,030
like running tens and hundreds incidents

1257
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:37,560
that we do we do develop some sort of

1258
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,730
gut feeling about you know something

1259
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,950
that smells very fishy in the beginning

1260
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,570
or something that's just like a small

1261
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:45,839
thing you know I think usually are

1262
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,300
feeling turns out to be part right so so

1263
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,150
this is a shocking moment right this is

1264
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,920
in network it's not actually it looks

1265
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:57,020
like a German flag but it's not Germany

1266
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:00,869
after the world cup final it's not and

1267
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,940
don't we there's there some incidents

1268
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:05,790
that are so serious that you need to

1269
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,710
tell your customer well it turns out

1270
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:12,740
that sixty percent of Europe you know

1271
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:16,109
your infrastructure is honed sorry and

1272
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,310
that's terrible that is if that doesn't

1273
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,740
happen very often because that's pretty

1274
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,830
serious but it's very serious to have to

1275
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,930
tell a customer that you know basically

1276
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,279
so the question of course what are we

1277
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,879
going to do and if you ask my

1278
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,450
investigator

1279
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,920
say you have to rebuild it all so yeah

1280
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,118
rebuilding although that does make let's

1281
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,170
say but if you want to be sure of course

1282
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,369
you know if you want to be a hundred

1283
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,099
centuries your problem that you have to

1284
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:40,980
rebuild that maple chain so but this is

1285
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,619
shopping so so you mean that my network

1286
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,900
that I've been running on and working

1287
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,730
with you know seventy percent is

1288
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,369
actually owned by somebody from the

1289
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,920
outside and this person or group of

1290
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:58,079
whoever kind of tolerates me to do my

1291
00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:00,180
job yes that's good yeah so sorry you

1292
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,740
pay for the electricity you pay for the

1293
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,049
stuff but it's not really your network

1294
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,308
anymore you know and it's kind of funny

1295
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:07,170
to top part of it this way but it's

1296
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:09,509
really that's also a bit traumatic you

1297
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:12,150
know because it I think you can compare

1298
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:14,250
it to coming home and finding out that

1299
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,690
somebody rents at your house if you

1300
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,910
violate it you know you feel violated

1301
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,369
because somebody that shouldn't be there

1302
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,410
has been in your infrastructure doing

1303
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:24,839
you know reading documents reading

1304
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,759
emails or maybe just doing nothing for a

1305
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,980
month you know whenever they felt like

1306
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:30,930
it and you didn't know and it's part of

1307
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,420
your fault maybe you didn't secure the

1308
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:36,118
well enough you know but it's still a

1309
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,319
violation so that's and this is what are

1310
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,720
you going to do what are you going to do

1311
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,490
when you find out this is fortunately it

1312
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,669
doesn't happen no we don't do this every

1313
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:47,250
day it's fine using sterile so what do

1314
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,960
you do sometimes the reaction is kind of

1315
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:52,230
like well maybe we should just use a

1316
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,640
broom and what kind of like don't really

1317
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,690
know I don't really want to know about

1318
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,700
it you know we we have and this is like

1319
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,650
still striking in my mind that the

1320
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,200
investigation last year where we did say

1321
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,660
I think on day three or something we

1322
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,029
said we think you've been on fifth time

1323
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,160
and of course this is our car stealing

1324
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:12,690
no for we know now I think it's going to

1325
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,629
lead to a bad spot it's going to lead to

1326
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,789
this fault we think you know but our

1327
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,500
customer didn't didn't believe I said

1328
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:21,269
well that's pretty serious not happen it

1329
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,619
doesn't and I think was a few days later

1330
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:24,538
that we could actually give the proof

1331
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,579
you know this is like peace or don't

1332
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:28,259
domain admins owns you know these are

1333
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,930
other admins home you know this is how

1334
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:33,029
it's like them proves it so what are you

1335
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,299
going to do you have to somehow get rid

1336
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:38,039
of it it's and the instinct is written

1337
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:39,490
very often in see what kind of like I

1338
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,710
don't have to deal with

1339
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:44,290
and send that so let's get it over with

1340
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,000
quickly as possible so one of the

1341
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,830
countering to the things that we advise

1342
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,990
our customers usually is that if you

1343
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:52,390
have a large scale compromised and the

1344
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:54,009
attacker is still in your network it's

1345
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,960
not a very ready to kick them out very

1346
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:59,170
quickly actually you know if you start

1347
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:02,010
doing investigation man that's why we

1348
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,010
you talk about investing

1349
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,828
mark attacker they will see it and they

1350
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:16,098
might already be gone they might

1351
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,839
temporarily move out you know and that

1352
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:19,099
might be nice you know because they're

1353
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,720
going right that's what your purpose was

1354
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:23,900
but you don't know what they were after

1355
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,490
so our advice is usually if you read

1356
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,319
once you realize that an attacker is to

1357
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,419
you network you better observe them for

1358
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,190
a while see what they do see which kind

1359
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,109
of information there after kind of like

1360
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,000
if you an inside bred into who they are

1361
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:36,650
what kind of information they are after

1362
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,859
maybe it gives you the opportunity to

1363
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,390
protect that information in a better way

1364
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:43,578
and you also need to you know detect it

1365
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,348
could be anywhere you know if it depends

1366
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:47,150
on which system is owned how is

1367
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,710
communication paths are you need to

1368
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,380
understand all these things before you

1369
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:54,049
can kick them out right before you can

1370
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,220
clean up clean up you know is the next

1371
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:57,288
topic that's that's a nice phone

1372
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,819
telescope password so what about this

1373
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:00,289
one and this is like different interest

1374
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:03,410
I've already mentioned the interest of

1375
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:05,480
commercial search versus somebody that

1376
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:07,098
hires you right there could be like

1377
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,500
conflicting interest is that like

1378
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:11,510
quickly as possible or drawn out as long

1379
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,579
as you can right so after I've told you

1380
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,589
how we deal with it by being as

1381
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:17,259
transparent as we can but there's

1382
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:21,259
different conflicting interests as well

1383
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:22,910
if you involve law enforcement they what

1384
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:25,069
do they want to do they want to catch a

1385
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,098
bad guy right they want to put a bad guy

1386
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:29,930
behind bars but the most important thing

1387
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,460
that you as a customer one do usually is

1388
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,279
to go back to addictions as usual as

1389
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,990
quickly as you can it hurts I want to

1390
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:38,539
get it over with and then go back to you

1391
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:41,689
know drinking beer stuff like that I can

1392
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:44,029
see you think of you so let's go think

1393
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,680
that enters is wrong law enforcement is

1394
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:47,509
not necessarily going to think of you as

1395
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,118
well you need to keep your service

1396
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:51,890
running they might want to image them

1397
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,289
right now and they need to be taken

1398
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,150
offline right and it doesn't very often

1399
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:58,970
come to these extreme situations but

1400
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,349
it's important to realize that if doing

1401
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,328
involve law enforcement or an

1402
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:05,059
intelligence agency they don't

1403
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:06,799
necessarily have the same interest that

1404
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:08,779
you have right they have a different

1405
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:10,670
interest that's north not necessarily so

1406
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:12,890
it could be conflicting usually they're

1407
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,690
very much overlapping which is nice that

1408
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:17,720
makes me go forward but sometimes I'm

1409
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,589
not always overlapping and disables of

1410
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,839
course regulators you know if you ever

1411
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:25,979
later coming to you for questions it's a

1412
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:28,200
different interest you know so there's

1413
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:30,598
lots of stuff to worry about there lots

1414
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,460
of have to worry about this one is clean

1415
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,289
up nice i like to call it sweeping

1416
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,890
actually not feeling up because dreaming

1417
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:39,569
up kind of implicitly you know you think

1418
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:42,719
that it was dirty before and after you

1419
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:44,130
clean up its totally clean but if i have

1420
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,410
to be honest if you have a large scale

1421
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,930
compromise I don't think I can you know

1422
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:50,489
you can realistically ever say we're

1423
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,469
totally clean and we know this for

1424
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:54,869
certain because simply you promised

1425
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:56,910
investigate everything right so you have

1426
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:59,069
to you have to get a certain certain

1427
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,538
feeling of this is good enough we know

1428
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:03,420
enough now we're pretty certain that

1429
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:05,069
this is what the attacker does and this

1430
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,440
is how we can get them out so it's more

1431
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:09,479
like sweeping right most of stuff that

1432
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,140
you see most of the stuff that you found

1433
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:15,058
out get rid of it take the guy out but

1434
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,950
of course it could be that somebody

1435
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,299
planted the back door or insistent

1436
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,089
somewhere far away that you have

1437
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:23,038
investigated it just needs one packet to

1438
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:25,650
come alive right that's a scenario that

1439
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,769
is a bit exotic but it's possible so you

1440
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,019
can never say I say with total certainty

1441
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:33,779
that you're totally clean you can't you

1442
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:35,430
can't the give us give us five million

1443
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:37,349
dollars will investigate five years

1444
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:39,538
maybe we'll tow it don't be absolutely

1445
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:41,910
true doesn't work right nobody's going

1446
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:44,009
it doesn't make a lot of sense to spend

1447
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,690
so much money in the investigation I

1448
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:48,930
would say you're probably better off

1449
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:51,839
spending the money but also keep stuff

1450
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,879
right preventive infrastructure chasers

1451
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,749
to have that the investigation only goes

1452
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:03,509
so far so so I've had customers calling

1453
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:05,729
me asking me so okay so now we're going

1454
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:07,049
to clean up and you know going to

1455
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:10,348
improve some stuff and does that mean

1456
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:11,880
that this never happened again and I

1457
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:13,619
feel honest and say I'm sorry it doesn't

1458
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,619
mean you can never happen get it can't

1459
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:19,349
happen again can happen again so for

1460
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:21,029
that priests unfortunate and I think

1461
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:24,539
most of us realized that if no hundred

1462
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:26,759
percent security of some organizations

1463
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,200
don't realize that they think it after a

1464
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:30,210
breach you know they can improve stuff

1465
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,230
and then they've done unfortunately

1466
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:36,650
you're never done

1467
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:38,840
so that's feeling that you get of course

1468
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,760
after you you hear this news that it

1469
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,590
could happen again next week well maybe

1470
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,570
it's less likely after half a year to

1471
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:47,630
prove stuff can happen again next week

1472
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:53,120
so but it's also nice not so much and i

1473
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:54,890
think that the guys on my team they not

1474
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,779
only have to be really good at you know

1475
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:58,879
some technical things so someone would

1476
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:01,010
like to come from a forensics piece of

1477
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,170
contacting someone from for the pen

1478
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:05,120
testing borrower or the network

1479
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,310
monitoring part but i also have to be

1480
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,750
good communicators you know because i

1481
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,700
think it's very important during times

1482
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:13,160
of crisis and incidents to be able to

1483
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,330
communicate well with your cousin not

1484
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,440
everybody you know it doesn't mean if

1485
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,880
you have a people walking around that

1486
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,760
the whole excellent communicators but

1487
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,110
you can't have 80 people looking at that

1488
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,670
screen you know if you have a customer

1489
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,080
with a pretty serious and impactful

1490
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,940
incident you know so so it's very

1491
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,529
important for us that we you know this

1492
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,970
is like you also need to be able to sit

1493
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,010
at the table drink coffee and talk about

1494
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:33,200
what's happening right without you know

1495
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,390
effect like it's like it's almost it's

1496
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,460
like a human relations team this is the

1497
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,859
feeling that we had so you need to do

1498
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,520
with it and unfortunately during

1499
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:46,040
incident that's not beer so i'll round

1500
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,750
off with a 6 loss of Oxford which are

1501
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,570
kind of like tongue in cheek but they're

1502
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:52,580
still depressing I think most

1503
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,250
organizations and I would this doesn't

1504
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:58,370
go for you but Sir more more aware of

1505
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:00,890
most organizations like they build it's

1506
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:03,109
very nice castle again at the end of the

1507
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:05,299
cliff and they don't realize the written

1508
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:08,180
a run most organizations don't

1509
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:11,360
understand that even if you're nuts like

1510
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,859
an interesting organization for for NSA

1511
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,660
you might still get hacked because some

1512
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,650
people don't really care which were

1513
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,089
throw over the head you know it just

1514
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,250
means that they have resources they're

1515
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,960
right or something that's just perfect

1516
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,450
background noise you know that you have

1517
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,100
to deal with so so most organizations

1518
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,140
don't understand the risk that they run

1519
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,580
they don't most people say all we're not

1520
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,379
that interesting what kind of

1521
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,509
information do we have to protect you

1522
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,460
know like who wants the heck ask you

1523
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,080
know or I mean that's really stuff that

1524
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,290
people say so I think most organizations

1525
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,090
run and I don't know how it works but

1526
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:44,339
it's very often that we come on site and

1527
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:46,529
it will be more upper management

1528
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:48,989
I don't understand this could happen to

1529
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:50,819
us and technical bit will say what if

1530
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:52,289
she is coming for three years you know

1531
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:54,479
like this was bound to happen at one

1532
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:56,160
point I don't really understand where

1533
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:58,410
the basement is where I can get a really

1534
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,700
explain how that works but obviously

1535
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,049
there's something that doesn't forget

1536
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,729
communicated well you know so most

1537
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:06,329
organizations run I think a higher risk

1538
00:56:02,729 --> 00:56:08,779
them they hint at the same time I think

1539
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:13,529
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit I

1540
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:16,440
don't always believe in flashy new apt

1541
00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:17,700
products you know because I do think

1542
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,259
that a lot of stuff that you need to do

1543
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,348
to protect yourself is stuff that we

1544
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:24,029
should have done in 1999 but you know I

1545
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:26,339
think times have changed and now it's

1546
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:27,749
more important it's not without reason

1547
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:29,160
that very often one of our

1548
00:56:27,749 --> 00:56:31,499
recommendations is that you need to do

1549
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,149
better segmenting you know because a lot

1550
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:35,578
of organizations still have fled

1551
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,900
networks you know with a firewall and

1552
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:39,450
once you're inside it's like a big

1553
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,759
pancake you know all over the place you

1554
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,259
know so that's very common it's very

1555
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:45,269
common so let's lowering fruit

1556
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:47,190
interested so many machines that are

1557
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,779
outdated and even if you can't fetch

1558
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,039
them you can probably do something else

1559
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:52,319
to protect them a little bit maybe you

1560
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,700
can monitor them better or you can fence

1561
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,038
them off you know but there's there's

1562
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:59,339
low hanging fruit before you go to a BD

1563
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,319
style jutsu or something you know you

1564
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:04,440
know I really believe that I really love

1565
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:05,940
flowing group I also believe that most

1566
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,839
networks would like this you know the

1567
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:11,219
full life like i said i would say

1568
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,960
probably eight percent the investigation

1569
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,670
that we were on we do plug in our own

1570
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,819
network equipment to monitor the network

1571
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:19,799
and it's it's a rare network that we see

1572
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:22,140
that it scheme that is not a big problem

1573
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:24,299
because like i said the zoo's infections

1574
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,680
in the grand scheme of things i don't

1575
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:27,150
think they should keep you awake at

1576
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,440
night you should definitely clean them

1577
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,670
up you know the phone so organization

1578
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,680
don't know that they're there you know

1579
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,109
the banking surgeons they happen all the

1580
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:37,440
time you know you've got like tried by

1581
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:39,538
infections from yahoo from from NBC from

1582
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,089
all kind of new snap science you know

1583
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,519
that that they serve advertisements and

1584
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:46,920
they they own you it also happens all

1585
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:49,109
the time so it's quite common for any

1586
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,369
network who have infections at any point

1587
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:52,469
times it's not something to worry about

1588
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:54,869
but I would say most organizations don't

1589
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,640
realize it you know that there's there's

1590
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:57,690
maybe two or three or ten or twenty

1591
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,900
machines in there

1592
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:04,590
our own and are constantly you know

1593
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:06,660
grabbing and sending out credentials you

1594
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,730
know and certificate stuff like that so

1595
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:11,370
it is by serious that's something that

1596
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:13,950
you should keep your way tonight

1597
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:16,319
somebody somebody wants might be the

1598
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:18,419
remark that most people in security to

1599
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,810
sleep like babies you know let's sleep

1600
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:24,810
for two hours when they wake up right

1601
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:27,360
there oh yeah so I talked about this

1602
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,529
than any incident in my view is never as

1603
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,810
big as it seems you know it's always

1604
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,550
bigger always bigger there's always

1605
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:34,290
stuff afterwards that you need to do so

1606
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,480
this is like a lot that's how we always

1607
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:38,220
want people before it and I think people

1608
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,130
are quick to forget you know if it's

1609
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,689
crisis than everybody now nothing is too

1610
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,400
weird you know we need to do whatever it

1611
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,170
takes to fix this and I understand that

1612
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,610
right so but it could be the three

1613
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,260
months later people are like well which

1614
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:51,420
prob which thing you know what we fixed

1615
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,310
it right so why do you need to invest

1616
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,250
more money in security even though it

1617
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:58,200
makes sense life so I think thank people

1618
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,760
that have their hands on the condo on

1619
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,560
the market I'm they'll they're quick to

1620
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,440
forget so sometimes it's good to not

1621
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,660
wait good prices but also the same goes

1622
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,910
for you know people like your neighbors

1623
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,830
and your family you might tell them oh

1624
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,270
this is not a very good idea from

1625
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:14,160
screwed Korine few this is not a good

1626
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:16,080
idea but you know two days later they

1627
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,240
will have forgotten right because it's

1628
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,980
not know what if somebody tells you my

1629
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,180
pension schemes I don't know that thing

1630
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,100
in Canada but then you are in the

1631
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,839
Netherlands pension schemes are the best

1632
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,370
way of getting people to sleep because

1633
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,200
it doesn't interest them right so so

1634
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,609
does security doesn't interest many

1635
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,589
people so they are very quick to forget

1636
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:34,380
and they will still click on link and

1637
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:35,880
open stuff and as normal we tested for

1638
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,570
safety as well we test ourselves of

1639
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,190
course and the nice thing is we do very

1640
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:43,020
like one of the very simple things that

1641
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:47,250
we do is just send emails to people

1642
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:49,920
right with links and we're Fox ID the

1643
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,420
only thing that we do is security where

1644
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,770
you know even people that reception

1645
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,570
don't find it strange that you need to

1646
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:56,490
believe in every door you know and i'll

1647
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:59,490
tell you you remember your browser you

1648
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:01,049
can afford NT people click on links so

1649
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:03,029
it happens right we're all human beings

1650
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:05,700
but what we find very important is that

1651
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:07,350
after you've clicked maybe certain

1652
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,700
percentage will realize and maybe I

1653
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:11,490
shouldn't have done that you know and

1654
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,799
then they report it so if i do some

1655
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,479
Roman I reported the security officer

1656
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,150
will not tell me you know you can bet

1657
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,369
what LW tell me thank you thank you for

1658
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,200
reporting this so an investigation see

1659
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:24,030
are serious in it so that's the approach

1660
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,310
see we take it from chatty that you know

1661
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:29,730
it's very human to make mistakes right

1662
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:31,259
and you will never ever there's going to

1663
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,880
be a moment for all of us that we are

1664
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,110
weak enough to click on the stupidest

1665
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,970
thing you know that it's definitely

1666
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,980
going to happen at one point that's just

1667
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,990
human being you know sort of thing we

1668
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,820
encourage it for sanity is that it's

1669
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,259
normal to make mistakes and its really

1670
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,300
good to report them and then you know

1671
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,550
you can investigate them we've done an

1672
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,900
investigation and this is like literally

1673
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:51,600
what this could have prevented you know

1674
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,760
with done investigation where the moment

1675
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,160
we stepped in and we realized that that

1676
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:59,340
that there was a large compromise and it

1677
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:02,009
was actually five months old so not very

1678
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,020
old and we managed to trace it back to

1679
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:07,800
the first system that what was infected

1680
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:10,950
and we find out which email was sent

1681
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,500
with which PDF and who it was aimed at

1682
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:16,200
and we didn't interview with the

1683
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,600
organization together of the person you

1684
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,549
know that actually open that email and a

1685
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,440
person could remember he's like yeah

1686
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,940
it's true I open an email and you know

1687
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,260
it's like it asked me to enter a

1688
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,970
passport you know that's what you put

1689
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,880
the password in the email body text and

1690
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:31,770
they enter it when you open the PDF side

1691
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,359
of course it encrypted so it goes class

1692
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,910
content filters and stuff or sometimes

1693
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,170
even work but you know so I had to enter

1694
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,319
a password and then nothing much

1695
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:42,210
happened that was strange man and that's

1696
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,609
exactly the situation that we want to

1697
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:46,980
avoid that you know people can click but

1698
01:01:44,609 --> 01:01:49,410
if this guy thought man that strains

1699
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,630
let's report an incident because it

1700
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,009
might be something weird and if you have

1701
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,510
reported through the health risk and

1702
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:57,590
they have investigated it they might

1703
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,730
have saved five months or four months of

1704
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,380
compromise you know so that's that's

1705
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,359
pretty serious and people will click

1706
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,790
who's there quickly forget and we're all

1707
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,500
stupid at one moment right we drink beer

1708
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:09,570
tonight if you come home that's going to

1709
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,900
be there like you and governor fan right

1710
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:16,020
so so the final law of boxer is in total

1711
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,820
I don't think that it exists to be in

1712
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,950
control you cannot be in control there's

1713
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,840
going three moments stuff continuously

1714
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,790
goes wrong and that's normal we accept

1715
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,010
that you know we accept

1716
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:28,040
unfortunately some people are going to

1717
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:30,840
die in traffic right we don't make the

1718
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,940
perfectly safe roads because what you

1719
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,500
know what they'll be too expensive that

1720
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,740
really will be too expensive we don't

1721
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,660
make a trophy-sized car so nobody has to

1722
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,100
prove be safe infrastructure because you

1723
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,690
know you will not have any customers

1724
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,299
because your product is going to be too

1725
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,640
expensive and that it doubly goes for

1726
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,500
nonprofit organizations which is tragic

1727
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,879
and sad actually you know and not

1728
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,010
everything costs money because there's

1729
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,960
also a free software but still it costs

1730
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:56,820
some resources to secure things you know

1731
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,160
so so in the end we don't go for the

1732
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,990
most secure stuff so you you can't be in

1733
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,420
control it doesn't exist stuff goes

1734
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:06,569
wrong and we always experience it during

1735
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,790
crises that you know it creates in it it

1736
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:11,160
never goes with you but you usually

1737
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,440
survive unless you're dizzy notre and

1738
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,940
you go road I didn't have left out that

1739
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,500
part but did you know where there's

1740
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,720
difficulty in the Netherlands that

1741
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,550
collect about two and half years ago

1742
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,189
from the black tulip report I recommend

1743
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:25,410
you read it so that organization did

1744
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:28,050
investigation didn't communicate

1745
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:31,560
anything then something up months

1746
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:34,710
later and it was public and I think 29

1747
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,990
weeks later they were bankrupt so I know

1748
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,370
doesn't say one thing directly to

1749
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:39,810
another but they're certainly factors

1750
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:43,770
involved and it's shocking so they've

1751
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:45,950
gone you know so and it doesn't really

1752
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:48,630
help doesn't really help so all I'll

1753
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:51,200
finish off with a quote from a guy that

1754
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:53,460
you guys I don't think you'll know he's

1755
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,379
one of the architects of the European

1756
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,990
Union and I think this quote is just

1757
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,860
great you know so if people and we see

1758
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,660
that all the time you know the

1759
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,310
organization's don't want to change that

1760
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,930
makes a lot of sense they don't want to

1761
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,420
change until they really really have to

1762
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:08,609
and they only really really have to when

1763
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,380
they're in crisis so in a crisis a lot

1764
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:12,690
of stuff gets done that should have been

1765
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,430
done very much over you know and that's

1766
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:15,960
something we Constitution it doesn't

1767
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:18,210
only apply to security this I think it

1768
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,920
applies to humanity you know so there

1769
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:22,350
are so many problems in the world that

1770
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,820
are not going to be solved unless we

1771
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,740
really have to and maybe then we're too

1772
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:29,250
late you know so so I think this is not

1773
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:31,589
a security this is my last slide so if

1774
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:33,150
you are ever in the Netherlands you want

1775
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,050
to go for beer you think it's not

1776
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,250
personal

1777
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:38,140
if you anywhere in the world at

1778
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:41,530
something shipping fsd you security-wise

1779
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:43,029
you call this number pretty close and if

1780
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,740
i were there be something to you know

1781
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:46,990
give you a tip or whatever even if you

1782
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,270
don't hire services that's fine so i

1783
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:51,069
hope that we have a nice beer later on

1784
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:52,060
and if you have any questions maybe you

1785
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,790
can ask them out because i've been

1786
01:04:52,060 --> 01:05:02,350
rambling for like I don't know a year a

1787
01:04:54,790 --> 01:05:03,700
year you know any questions it somebody

1788
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:07,540
said this is Ronnie said I

1789
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:09,640
recognize this question for you so

1790
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:14,100
basically as I understand what you are

1791
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:17,940
going to client deadline you are only

1792
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:21,250
investigating the problem I can say that

1793
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,500
but you are not fixing it while

1794
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:28,630
gesturing to the dragon that you are act

1795
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:31,600
and this is door was open and the guy

1796
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:34,780
needs efforts making that and that is

1797
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,640
that correct so the question is are we

1798
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,700
only involved in investigating what's

1799
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:43,180
going what went wrong or do we also do

1800
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:45,370
something else we do are one of the

1801
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,589
primary things that we do is investigate

1802
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:49,420
so will answer questions like the guy

1803
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:51,460
went through that door the tube that

1804
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,110
paper you know that pencil and he left

1805
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:54,220
at that time through that door right

1806
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,830
that's the kind of questions that we

1807
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:59,169
want to answer but we will also tell the

1808
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:02,200
customer well it's better to secure your

1809
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:05,500
property by installing cameras or by

1810
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,600
raising the fence we might we don't

1811
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,980
actually Ray's defense ourselves you

1812
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,529
know if you want to have people

1813
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:14,080
installing firewalls we don't do that we

1814
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:17,140
do actually do network monitoring stuff

1815
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:19,750
like that but and we do sometimes help

1816
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,060
organizations usually after incidents

1817
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:24,160
with like multi-year programs to improve

1818
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:27,400
security so we are involved afterwards

1819
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:31,629
as well sometimes involve the theory

1820
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:35,130
part sorry you on the theory part or the

1821
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:35,130
practical for me

1822
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:45,279
you tell them how to face the issue but

1823
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:47,469
you don't build anything to face it no

1824
01:06:45,279 --> 01:06:49,479
not necessarily the question is shall we

1825
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:51,609
do the tea ready for non-critical it's

1826
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:53,348
like we're security company so we're not

1827
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:55,089
really you know we're not going to

1828
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:57,969
segment your network and there are

1829
01:06:55,089 --> 01:07:01,299
things like we do have some security

1830
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:03,849
products and services but in general

1831
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:05,259
it's it's a pretty precise way of saying

1832
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:07,630
well this is what we think you should

1833
01:07:05,259 --> 01:07:09,849
improve and it's not necessarily that we

1834
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,890
are the ones to do it for you yeah

1835
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:15,009
that's right that's right i mean at

1836
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:18,788
times we can but it's not always obvious

1837
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:23,140
that we should or would you know how

1838
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:24,489
will it make sense anything you want to

1839
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,828
talk about an instant anybody want to

1840
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:33,699
talk about an incident happen to them

1841
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:36,759
usually not a question let's yes that i

1842
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:43,660
have a network and it has been act few

1843
01:07:36,759 --> 01:07:45,579
weeks ago and i have a i'm working for a

1844
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,959
customer and you are working for me

1845
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:52,900
because i have seen that i was at and

1846
01:07:48,959 --> 01:07:56,259
what can I trust my data from the is my

1847
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:58,689
customer because you are here as my

1848
01:07:56,259 --> 01:08:01,959
customer that I'm working for someone

1849
01:07:58,689 --> 01:08:05,319
else and and I'm taking data from this

1850
01:08:01,959 --> 01:08:09,089
guy who can I trust my data that's all

1851
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:13,259
being packed because I have no clue that

1852
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:15,279
something is still like it should be I

1853
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:17,229
would last question how do you trust

1854
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,779
your data in normal circumstances yeah

1855
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:22,118
because it's the it's a very very

1856
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:24,369
suitable question if you mean if you're

1857
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:26,618
a soft a contractor from someone you do

1858
01:08:24,368 --> 01:08:29,229
in that circumstance where company a

1859
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:31,238
hires Company B Company big attacked and

1860
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:33,509
you hire an external consultant to to

1861
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:36,759
investigate is that what you mean I mean

1862
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:40,089
let's say not many more yes is my

1863
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:44,589
customer yeah okay and I scene I I

1864
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:48,189
didn't act mexico and i'm not an expert

1865
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:52,180
in security yeah okay so I

1866
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:56,738
I will hire you for him to investigate

1867
01:08:52,180 --> 01:09:01,080
my problem yeah and my problem is I am

1868
01:08:56,738 --> 01:09:04,269
data from that mr. but I have no idea

1869
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:07,000
it's yeah data yeah absolutely true

1870
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:10,180
actually true imaginary production a big

1871
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,130
prediction four million dollars I don't

1872
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:16,330
know what to do well one thing is that

1873
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:18,960
this is not this is not one hundred

1874
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:22,238
percent always right but it's very often

1875
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,390
intruders I have to save if you don't

1876
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,790
care because it doesn't apply in Oz with

1877
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:30,130
very often data is being actual trated

1878
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,899
but not necessarily motivate modified

1879
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:34,180
right that doesn't mean it cannot happen

1880
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:35,830
right and the question that you raised

1881
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,690
like how can I trust my day that

1882
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:40,238
actually goes all across the

1883
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:42,818
investigation right because how can we

1884
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,580
trust a log yeah on a machine that's

1885
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:47,190
home right is that if you ask us can we

1886
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,630
trust that log one hundred percent no

1887
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:53,139
leave the new trucks that log in most

1888
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:55,600
places yeah probably yes so so an

1889
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,790
investigation actually is putting pieces

1890
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,310
of puzzle together right so if you

1891
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:02,350
investigate one machine with evidence

1892
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:04,600
that you don't know even has been

1893
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:07,170
tampered with and the evidence suggests

1894
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,520
maybe that this hypothesis right

1895
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:12,489
investigate other machines that support

1896
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,949
the same opposites that might be right

1897
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:17,650
you know but that's why in our reports

1898
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:20,650
we very rarely say this is what happened

1899
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:23,320
but will say it's quite likely this

1900
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,179
happened it's not likely this happen or

1901
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,489
this couldn't happen but it's it's very

1902
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,140
rare that we can be honest and certain

1903
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:31,839
what happened because it's very rare

1904
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:34,239
that people have centralized log on on

1905
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,640
right only devices you know if you know

1906
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:39,160
it's it's a rare situation where all the

1907
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:44,530
evidence is in the best condition you

1908
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:46,960
know so the correlation yes basically

1909
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:48,880
what you do is you form hypotheses about

1910
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,410
what what happened right you tagger

1911
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,750
could prob we have done this or this or

1912
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:55,330
this based on the motive for the means

1913
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:58,210
or you know capabilities and you kind of

1914
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:59,870
try to see if if there are there are

1915
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,000
three phases and ever

1916
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:03,920
is that you see that disprove your

1917
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,900
hypothesis I said it couldn't have been

1918
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,000
this you know but it's it's it's not

1919
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:10,490
it's fuzzy you know it's very rarely on

1920
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,940
percent it's nice like for another

1921
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:15,980
example is if somebody owns your web or

1922
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:17,620
like does some simple injection tricks

1923
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:20,150
and they like pull out the database

1924
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:23,330
you're not going to see from any logs

1925
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:24,710
normally which data was lost right so

1926
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:27,080
that was one of the most important

1927
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:30,140
question is which data did they access

1928
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,180
well honestly in most cases we can't

1929
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,400
tell you you may be able to say from

1930
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:37,010
like like from apache logs you might get

1931
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,500
see sizes you know both you no regrets

1932
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:41,480
and stuff like that so you can infer how

1933
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,180
much data across the line but normally

1934
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:46,370
no idea so you have to assume it's all

1935
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:48,560
compromised you have to assume all your

1936
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,220
data is compromised but it's rare and

1937
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,290
sometimes we come across that we have an

1938
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:56,960
investigation where they had a sort of

1939
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:59,300
flight recorder so a machine that

1940
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,580
captured all network traffic and like

1941
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:04,400
retain it for about I don't know three

1942
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,080
weeks or so and if you then have a like

1943
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,370
a compromise on website with sequin

1944
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,930
jection you can actually look at a

1945
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:10,610
flight recorder and see all the data

1946
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:13,220
that went by and then it's like a

1947
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:14,839
separate machine that you know source

1948
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:17,030
the day that you can't access so

1949
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,320
whatever you see there it's like close

1950
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,450
to one hundred percent sure you know

1951
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,330
it's like it's like a black box rumor

1952
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:25,400
from a plane it's really nice but it's

1953
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,890
rare you know so your question is very

1954
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:30,259
valid and not only about the data from

1955
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:32,390
across what all your data investigation

1956
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:34,460
is that you don't really know if it has

1957
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:36,830
been tampered with but the truth is that

1958
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:39,380
in many investigations with you know not

1959
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:42,380
such sophisticated hackers loads are

1960
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:44,030
okay logs are really okay it's only in

1961
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,580
the you know the upper look up the

1962
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,750
smarter criminals or you know

1963
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,790
intelligence agencies that you really a

1964
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,140
question and then you really have to

1965
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:53,510
look at life never trucking and stuff

1966
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:56,000
like that but it's difficult and it's

1967
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:57,950
also not easy for our customers always

1968
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,710
to accept the fact that we can't speedy

1969
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:04,160
in certain people you know that we would

1970
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:05,780
it is just the case it's not it's not

1971
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,090
without reason that you have to approve

1972
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,530
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt it's not

1973
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,320
a hundred percent certainty because that

1974
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:12,660
doesn't really exist

1975
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:17,370
even in like life murder cases and stuff

1976
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:19,860
like that that's very rare so yeah good

1977
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:24,120
question I like a question what is the

1978
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:25,830
little detail that we live and in their

1979
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:30,780
report that you get your customer is

1980
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:35,070
just en design of compromise some detail

1981
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:37,469
about Wi-Fi we can find in which yeah in

1982
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:39,990
which older because you know when your

1983
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:42,420
customer lupien is how do we face we

1984
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:44,940
will have to store some back up so he'll

1985
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,650
Jackie shared his that compromise you

1986
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,330
know so question is what kind of level

1987
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,790
detail do we give a report and the

1988
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:52,290
answer is it depends depends on the

1989
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:54,390
customer what they want so it's also

1990
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:56,040
very important for us and also very

1991
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,540
difficult to kind of determine that

1992
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,640
because it doesn't make a lot of sense

1993
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,960
if you have a really really detailed

1994
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,400
report and the customers like oh I just

1995
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,280
wanted a management summary you know

1996
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,690
because so so that's there's some kind

1997
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,519
of going back and forth about trying to

1998
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:10,019
find out after we're gone it doesn't

1999
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,210
mean that we're going on right so you

2000
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,520
can always apply additional details very

2001
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:16,920
often during the investigation already

2002
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,660
we have supplied a lot of details to do

2003
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,790
it's not they don't have to wait until

2004
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:24,059
the entry portrait do already supply

2005
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:26,550
information about compromised accounts

2006
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:29,220
about five suspicious but a lot of

2007
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:31,530
information we already give and we might

2008
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:34,680
summarize it in a report but it's

2009
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:37,380
already been given to the customer so

2010
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:39,720
what else and of course if you if you

2011
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:42,180
have investigations where no but if

2012
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,650
you're a telco you pick out GCSU you can

2013
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:46,260
be damn sure you don't have it end up in

2014
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,750
court it doesn't end up your code there

2015
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,950
is stuff that doesn't end of report and

2016
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:52,920
stuff that ends up in court has to be

2017
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:57,179
understand good right so that's why we

2018
01:14:52,920 --> 01:15:00,570
if law enforcement is involved then if a

2019
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:02,760
case has any chat physical report or SP

2020
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:05,580
friends it sounds it's different than my

2021
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,950
web servers own fix it and then you know

2022
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:10,080
that doesn't really require very big

2023
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:12,210
forensic imaging in soccer but if it has

2024
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,100
to go to court has to be friends sanity

2025
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:16,110
your report and description has to be

2026
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,540
quite detailed as well and you will have

2027
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,940
to you know provide reasons about why

2028
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,710
did you image this machine this way why

2029
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,349
did you not take a memory dump no

2030
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,810
because

2031
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:28,060
or whatever you know or the imaging

2032
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:30,340
correct three times you know you have to

2033
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:32,410
record all the information they have to

2034
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:34,240
record chain of custody of evidence and

2035
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,620
stuff like that so it's a lot of work

2036
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,269
but it's very important to get it right

2037
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,280
otherwise you might get thrown under

2038
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:41,680
court but these are more importantly

2039
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:44,889
like internal fraud cases because once

2040
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:47,500
the own web server I don't know if it

2041
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:50,080
only comes from Thor no exit notes you

2042
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,250
know it's the chances are very small or

2043
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,340
you're ever going to find out we did

2044
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:56,380
that so you're better off then making

2045
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:59,470
sure that you know that the homegrown

2046
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:01,930
website that you have improves you know

2047
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:07,770
that's better so yeah how bad is your

2048
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:07,770
person think it's beer time

2049
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,539
you
