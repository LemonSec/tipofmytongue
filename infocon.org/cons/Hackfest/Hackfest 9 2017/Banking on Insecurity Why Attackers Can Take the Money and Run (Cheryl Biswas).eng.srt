00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,319
salut Bienvenue

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,899
well Jill to the Mancha Street offensive

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,080
this jet but you see Oh she'll clean Jim

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,980
had passed Jim that they won't say Jim

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,560
OC love it when we take the fella say

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,330
avec food and now I will speak in

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,640
English okay I'm really excited to talk

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,740
to you about one of my very favorite

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,439
subject areas thanking on insecurities

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,130
so first of all who am i Cheryl this

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,610
boss I work in cybersecurity now I am

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,640
with a small firms I Kira include it's

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,730
offensive stuff I was with KPMG before

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,550
that I have a lot of interests as you

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,360
can see I have a poli-sci degree so it's

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,059
important to remember anything you learn

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,489
you can bring into the security

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,270
community and use I love to give talks

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,070
and I'm also a founding member of the

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,710
Diana initiative where we promote women

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,438
in security and diversity finally online

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,770
I'm known as encrypted and last but not

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,960
least the views expressed here are my

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,110
own not those of my employer but let's

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,340
get started a couple of years ago when I

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,330
was a total newb

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,850
I saw patterns repeating themselves and

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,680
while that might be good at knitting it

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,450
is not such a good thing for security

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,979
and bad behaviors lead to lot security

32
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,619
the basics well they weren't being done

33
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,140
well if they were being done at all and

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,170
I found attitudes ranged from blissful

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,490
ignorance to adamant denials again

36
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,140
history repeats itself and that's not

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,530
necessarily a good thing you can make

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,520
book on that so we're seeing big data

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,259
become bigger data and IOT taking over

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,409
the world right but we are still not

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,860
getting the basics right the problem is

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,930
we rely on what we know or what we think

43
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,590
we know we're living in a world of some

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,140
pretty dangerous assumptions and

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,030
that's leading to some cracks in the

46
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,980
framework of what run our daily lives so

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,790
what I want to point out is that

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,200
information security cyber security

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,790
these do not live in silos

50
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,420
these are integral to everything that we

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,020
do now we get that everybody else not so

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,200
much

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,870
let's talk about some blasts from the

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,400
past who's familiar with Conficker how

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,510
about everybody knows Stuxnet good good

56
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,040
bedtime reading who's familiar with the

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,330
stories around Saudi Aramco two words

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,290
wiper mal they're their dad stuff and it

59
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,340
made a resurgence this year

60
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,840
how about Hartley oh geez yeah and who's

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,540
still cleaning up after this one okay

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,180
there are candies candies for all of you

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:33,519
because you've suffered so much I know

64
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,940
and it's just like it keeps coming back

65
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,670
it never went away

66
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:46,480
yeah so we're not we keep repeating

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
mistakes and the problem is this is not

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,910
like the movie Groundhog Day we're not

69
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,060
getting better at doing the same thing

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,920
over and over what we're doing is

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,989
leaving windows of opportunity open and

72
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,880
when you do that who needs back doors

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,850
right so the attackers are literally

74
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,730
banking on our insecurities which brings

75
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,040
for me anyway a few things to mind and

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm going to share them with you that

77
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,130
what we need to say isn't being said

78
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,350
that's why I did this talk I did it

79
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,169
behind closed doors in Vegas and I just

80
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,050
had so many people coming up saying they

81
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,669
have a lot to say but they can't talk

82
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,950
about it but it's what we share with

83
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,650
each other that's crucial that

84
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,650
information helps us spot patterns do

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,669
trends identify things in the malware

86
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,890
that link one group to another so that

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,330
we can see their next move their next

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,840
pivot so let's talk about Swiss baby and

89
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,930
we are going to or how about geopolitics

90
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,110
and who's playing whom because there is

91
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,950
a real art to the long game and China

92
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,370
and Putin are masters at it that's

93
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,280
playing out in the theater real right

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,000
now because it isn't all about the money

95
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,389
let's talk about what attackers do

96
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,160
better than us I've got two words for it

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,889
collaboration and communication the fact

98
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,659
is these guys have learned how to work

99
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,110
with each other because cybercrime is an

100
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,900
extremely efficient business model these

101
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,039
guys share their information work

102
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,879
effectively as defenders we have to get

103
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,069
it right all of the time as attackers

104
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:48,159
they only have to get it right once what

105
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,830
we benefit from as a community what we

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,500
thrive out as a community is the

107
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,990
information that we share and teach each

108
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,870
other and that we need to communicate so

109
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,550
there were not all of us working in a

110
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,889
silo heads down trying to find something

111
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,590
that already exists this will give us a

112
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,469
leg up it will save us time and time is

113
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,490
a luxury we don't have

114
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,120
so let's move into stories about Swift

115
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,060
ok so we assume that banks especially

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,069
Swift right if you know anything about

117
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,300
Swift and you're going to after this

118
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,090
take better care of our money than

119
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,479
anybody ok so what is Swift other than a

120
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,580
very important international

121
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,919
organization with a couple hundred plus

122
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,210
members and a lot of money involved it

123
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,919
originated to facilitate transfer

124
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,099
payments between nation-states and and

125
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,069
it was done to make it easier more

126
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,259
efficient and faster these are really

127
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,120
important words in business in

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,759
bottom-line and in profit we know that

129
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,310
business is what drives us we know that

130
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,319
we serve the businesses we are part of

131
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,050
however it does not mean security so

132
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,729
Swiss cents payment orders between

133
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,090
institutions and it uses unique Swift

134
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,819
codes this was based on a relationship

135
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,969
management application that runs over a

136
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,770
bilateral key exchange

137
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,509
so essentially is about syntax processes

138
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,520
and a turnkey solution for ease of use

139
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,800
when Swit talks about itself it talks in

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,949
terms of efficiency this is what

141
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,789
business understands is reliable now we

142
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,440
know that we're supposed to trust but

143
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,259
verify right

144
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,870
however when we're being told we are

145
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,410
supposed to trust an organization like

146
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,419
Swift because it is the best at what it

147
00:07:53,419 --> 00:08:03,470
does we do and then there's this okay so

148
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,610
we've got availability levels which are

149
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,190
a proof of their security equipment okay

150
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,740
please tell me anybody does security

151
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,449
equate with up time is up time

152
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,849
equivalent to secure anybody there's

153
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,280
chocolate on this no there is chocolate

154
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:32,530
chocolate for the room yes over there

155
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,539
security is not uptime I'm sorry okay

156
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,380
so since I got to give that talk on

157
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,899
Swift and that was like a summer ago and

158
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,390
I built it as a fairy tale on banking

159
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,839
security I have been following a steady

160
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,850
stream of attacks building a knowledge

161
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,010
base on it looking at the trends that

162
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,720
have been developing and it it really

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,510
has not led up so what I'm seeing here

164
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,440
is so much more than a cash graph and

165
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,100
that's really important what happened

166
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,250
with Swift the trusted messengering

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,670
service is a really important lesson for

168
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,800
everybody who's in the financial

169
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,920
industry and then security as a whole

170
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,270
this story for me was always so much

171
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,420
more about not the attackers trying to

172
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,980
get a billion dollars and only getting

173
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,339
81 million what what it was was three

174
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,820
questions it was who was behind those

175
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,240
hackers why did they specifically target

176
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,480
the Bank of Bangladesh and who was

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,019
desperate enough to digitally rob a bank

178
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,160
ah okay so this was from BAE Systems

179
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,069
when they initially identified the

180
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,629
attack and it's really quite fascinating

181
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,329
in terms of I would call it the

182
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,519
sophistication of the attack the

183
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,959
components that they knew how to

184
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,910
leverage you're working with what is

185
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,100
essentially a closed system and it was

186
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,119
accessible to the members however we

187
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,309
know that net attackers lurk in the

188
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,350
networks for as long as they need to and

189
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,230
they gather recon they get in and then

190
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,449
they live there because we don't find

191
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,339
them we don't find them because we're

192
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,069
not looking for them this goes back to

193
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:23,029
let's get the basics right we know this

194
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,579
and that is what they were making book

195
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,209
on so somebody figured out what the weak

196
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,119
point in that money chain was for Swift

197
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,379
the daily transfer printouts paper

198
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,189
printouts of the transfers this is a

199
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,799
highly sophisticated system but they

200
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,980
rely on paper transfers paper printouts

201
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,589
of the transfers every day this is key

202
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,429
because it's quite the story now it came

203
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,220
out in the news that it was all at the

204
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,350
fault of a $10 switch okay we all know

205
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,779
server room terrorists right everybody

206
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,420
has seen that server room of cables and

207
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,799
stuff that should not be in there and

208
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,509
it's easy to point the finger of blame

209
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,649
but the fact is I think that's held up

210
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,259
as a reflection to all of us to learn

211
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,189
from it wasn't because of that $10

212
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:20,929
switch it was because of everything

213
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,019
around why there was a $10 switch in

214
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:30,829
service it was because of a printer this

215
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,319
printer to be exact and that's kind of

216
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,629
the brilliance of the scheme so a whole

217
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,429
lot of checking and monitoring the files

218
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,769
was going on not by Swift by the bank by

219
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,350
the attackers the attackers were

220
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,809
watching every single move every single

221
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,089
line of code making sure they knew when

222
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,220
that printer kicked in what it needed

223
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,329
what it did why because the malware they

224
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,029
they wrote for this intercepted the

225
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,699
confirmation Swift messages so it read

226
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,529
it parsed and then it converted those

227
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,839
into PRT files and then into the

228
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,319
specific PCL language used by this this

229
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,839
model of printer that's very exact

230
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,579
somebody really did their homework and

231
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,119
then these temporary PRT files were

232
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,389
submitted and once they came through

233
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,470
they got overwritten with zeros and were

234
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,720
prospectively deleted enabling the

235
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,600
attackers to step in at that point

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,720
control the process and walk away with

237
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,379
the money so there's a lot of

238
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,879
speculation there was a lot of

239
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,679
speculation at that time about whodunit

240
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,009
and I'll admit my my trio was the

241
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,089
obvious ones China Russia North Korea

242
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,809
now in this case Russia and China really

243
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,860
weren't good targets because they're too

244
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,959
big to make this kind of noise this kind

245
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,910
of a power play globally they knew they

246
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,790
would suffer eternal condemnation it

247
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,139
wasn't in it it wasn't in it for them

248
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,759
and it was only really a billion dollars

249
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,489
these these two nations did not need a

250
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:09,009
billion dollars badly enough to put

251
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,110
themselves in the hot seat however North

252
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,319
Korea is the different story this is a

253
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,850
nation if you know anything about it

254
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,089
that is impoverished it really is it's

255
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,209
it's sad and the people there are

256
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,129
starving because of the way the country

257
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,489
is being run because their wild card of

258
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:33,189
a leader will stop at nothing to get his

259
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,619
nukes this is a fact and we now have

260
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,589
watched it play out arms Fox and CNN

261
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,489
real life so how long did it take for it

262
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,399
to come apparent it was the Lazarus

263
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,239
group at work in North Korea with a

264
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,689
wrench and with a wrench because in many

265
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,779
parts of our world coercion is how you

266
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,179
get things done and they needed

267
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:00,999
something to get the initial access and

268
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,910
then to cover their tracks so my theory

269
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,029
was that Lil Kim wanted all of the same

270
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,010
nuclear toys all the other cool kid

271
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,270
ha but we know that good nukes cost

272
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,880
money right and Kim had broken his piggy

273
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,300
bank some while ago the things we do for

274
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,420
money his nation was starving so he had

275
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,990
some very capable houseguests known as

276
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,900
the Lazarus group living under his room

277
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,940
now does anybody know the story of

278
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,810
Lazarus what that term means in the bib

279
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,420
in the Bible it's about a guy who rose

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,080
from the dead so it's used to imply

281
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,790
somebody who literally can rise up from

282
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,740
the dead and this is a hallmark of this

283
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,990
group they will they will do their acts

284
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,710
they will disappear only to reappear

285
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,970
again their ephemeral and they have been

286
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,850
impossible really to pinpoint to a

287
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,750
specific entity or party very

288
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,930
interesting there ven DDoS attacks

289
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,320
dating from 2009 you can see they're

290
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,660
involved in a list of very interesting

291
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,710
activities and even this year there was

292
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,200
some wiping of master boot records going

293
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,210
on because of them they're able to make

294
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,210
their work look like hacktivism so that

295
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,730
throws you know a red herring in the

296
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,800
works and harder to attribute and as we

297
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,930
know attribution unfortunately is the

298
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,240
hardest thing to do and one of those

299
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,280
roadblocks that keeps us from moving

300
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,010
forward we can't move forward and you

301
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,410
can't pin that big pin the finger of

302
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,940
blame until you are absolutely certain

303
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,400
well they've been active in sabotaging

304
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,190
operations in a range of industries not

305
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,550
just financial and a pretty wide swath

306
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,900
of nations have been impacted now North

307
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,830
America is only just beginning to feel

308
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,400
their talents and is it me or is it that

309
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,040
we don't pay attention as much until it

310
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,820
actually lands on North American soil

311
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,300
anybody want to weigh in on that one

312
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,910
does it have to actually land on our

313
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,980
doorstep before we will take action like

314
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,540
I said time is a luxury we don't have

315
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,209
The Washington Post issued a really

316
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,310
interesting article very recently

317
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,040
analyzing what was happening in terms of

318
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,850
the nuclear developments in North Korea

319
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,060
assessing Kim Jong as the type of leader

320
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,459
and not in a rational leader somebody

321
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,870
with a game plan that we had

322
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,410
underestimated or sidestepped because it

323
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,380
looked too crazy basically they said

324
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,540
that if you deem Kim Jon you need to be

325
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,029
irrational you are implicitly under

326
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,640
estimating him and we might be doing

327
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,559
that for a few other things as well

328
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,559
he's crazy but he's crazy like a fox and

329
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,929
that's why attacks were being made on

330
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,540
thanks that the rest of the world really

331
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,390
wasn't paying attention to it was

332
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,869
Switzerland uh-huh it was England mm-hmm

333
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,160
it was the US for sure but go put it in

334
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,800
some place in Southeast Asia that people

335
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,990
don't really know about there's not very

336
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,970
much attention and it's actually

337
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,169
division it gets pointed there so case

338
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,190
in point let me well let me say this

339
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,080
it's not our world over there

340
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,240
like I said coercion is how things get

341
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,400
done this is the nation that doesn't

342
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,110
have the resources to work with that we

343
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,790
take for granted on a daily basis they

344
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,950
don't have the money and they don't have

345
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,600
the training and they don't have the

346
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,090
mindset to put in place the security

347
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,230
practices needed to really secure a

348
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,929
financial facility so if corruption

349
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,640
could end coercion or how things get

350
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,200
done in the rest of the world how did

351
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
these get factored on a nist spreadsheet

352
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,340
and security audits

353
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,860
this is the heist by numbers what had

354
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,830
been recorded up to date and then very

355
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,549
recently taiwan has weighed in with an

356
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,490
attack on them now the attackers went

357
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,220
after about sixty million dollars so far

358
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,929
most of that has been got me back

359
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,420
there's about five hundred thousands

360
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,350
still on return and they are absolutely

361
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,020
this time attributing it to the lazarus

362
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:49,890
group so lessons let's do a swift recap

363
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,290
now this isn't the first time that a

364
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,090
nation states handed over the dirty work

365
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,090
to an independent contractor you can bet

366
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,160
that russia has done that as well as the

367
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,780
united states and other major countries

368
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,120
but in what is essentially a win-win

369
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,500
scenario except of course for the bank

370
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,130
of bangladesh the attackers went after

371
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,559
that cool billion and save for what was

372
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,450
a pesky spelling mistake on the transfer

373
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,179
which got rejected they had to walk away

374
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,280
with the 81 million here are the banks

375
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,610
involved and this third point i'm going

376
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,980
to ask you to remember this we'll come

377
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,460
back to it

378
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,090
I thought this was very telling it's a

379
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,880
wake-up call for those just tuning in

380
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,940
yeah it is true because when it comes to

381
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,820
the games that nation-states play well

382
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,400
Kabul economic chaos it's right up there

383
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,220
so let's talk about shadow brokers and

384
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,500
you know that other shoe it's gonna drop

385
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,020
because you can count all of the cards

386
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,760
but that wild card is going to turn up

387
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,330
and when it does nation state exploits

388
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,450
are now out there the turtle blue we

389
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,430
know what happens and thus kiddies have

390
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,010
them and they are playing with them so

391
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,270
I'm going to share a little post

392
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,050
Halloween Horror Story with you okay

393
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,240
chocolates chocolates for those who did

394
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:34,070
not get chocolate yes yes

395
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,250
Oh guys oh I'm a horrible pitchy garden

396
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,970
[Laughter]

397
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,960
okay I promise

398
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,750
laters okay let's talk about what was in

399
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,430
that treasure trove that the shadow

400
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,980
brokers revealed as their Easter egg on

401
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,580
Good Friday

402
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,840
Ars Technica said this not me so Swift

403
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,900
Swift was adamant at the time that they

404
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,260
had not been hacked or their code their

405
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,430
code had not been hacked

406
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,580
well sorry not sorry because that Good

407
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,240
Friday dump was full of stuff

408
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,280
including code for hacking banks that

409
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,470
were part of the Swift Network in

410
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,570
particular thanks in the Middle East and

411
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,870
these belong to a cheaper offshoot of

412
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,600
the Swift Network known as service

413
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,880
bureaus and these act is like their

414
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,950
they're like cloud services for banks

415
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,780
but they're less expensive because it

416
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,780
costs money to pay money and Swift is

417
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,980
very pricey well one of those was called

418
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,130
east nets and remember this is the

419
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,230
United States the NSA their exploits

420
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,500
east nets is one of 74 certified service

421
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,870
bureaus within the Swift Network so

422
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,090
they're all part of this trusted network

423
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,270
until Swift says oh you're not as good

424
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,530
as we are and actually they do that

425
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm all for value but I'm gonna raise

426
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,480
the question here what isn't it's more

427
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,900
easily targeted because it wasn't a

428
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,620
premiums with offering I don't know if

429
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,560
any of you know of Matt's wish but he is

430
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,440
a security researcher a Microsoft MVP

431
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,500
and quite active on Twitter he has some

432
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,420
excellent accounts in a blog post and I

433
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,090
follow him for stuff especially breaking

434
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,770
news and he did a really good take down

435
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,050
in terms of what was in the shadow

436
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,140
brokers treasure trove and and how it

437
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,160
impacted the Swift Network especially

438
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,880
those Middle Eastern banks he said this

439
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,490
given the small number of these service

440
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,350
bureaus of which there is just 74 and

441
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,400
that they have like maybe one IP address

442
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,010
how easy would it be to compromise any

443
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,870
if not all of these service bureaus I

444
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,040
believe that one with you

445
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,460
Matt's wishes ago - for me for many

446
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,610
reasons and I really I'll have some

447
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,290
information on my very last slide if you

448
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,240
want to look it up further he provided

449
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,120
some screenshots at the time of the dump

450
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,820
and explanations about how the NSA had

451
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,460
actually compromised with before North

452
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,780
Korea was even in this game so here you

453
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,820
can see some of the findings that were

454
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,290
in that trove that stuff that should

455
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,390
never be available these are compromised

456
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,790
in men accounts sophisticated these were

457
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,980
multi-stage attacks that bypassed the

458
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,430
Cisco AAS a firewall appliances so they

459
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,290
exploited and they infected the Windows

460
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,920
servers and then they copied the Oracle

461
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,770
databases of the numerous hosts that

462
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,300
belong to Swift now we know that Oracle

463
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,070
has many bad dates right we know that

464
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,390
Windows is Windows nonetheless this was

465
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,500
not something that should have ever

466
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,930
happened and it is as bad as it sounds

467
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,000
because these service bureaus were part

468
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,460
of what was considered to be a trusted

469
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,470
network moreover Matt and I would agree

470
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,840
with him on this one likens it to

471
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,580
Stuxnet in that this was that very

472
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,700
rarest of occasions when a nation-state

473
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,310
targeted another nation-state with a

474
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,930
bunch of O'Day's yeah that is very very

475
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,820
significant it went after that

476
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,040
nation-states critical infrastructure

477
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,170
with those Oh dates and banks are

478
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,520
critical infrastructure

479
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,899
here's the list of targets that the NSA

480
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:49,519
exploits were targeted at from as early

481
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,829
as 2013 and that are now out there and

482
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,649
being played with so this is the

483
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:56,659
equivalent of hacking all of the banks

484
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,819
in the region without having to attack

485
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:01,759
them individually right this is very

486
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,789
easy to easy and why we should be

487
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,129
worried because this way you can access

488
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:14,799
all of their transactions compromised

489
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,269
this is what it actually looked like

490
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,399
when you run the exploits against for

491
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,769
example the Palestinian Bank and over

492
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,789
here there's hard corded hard coded

493
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:28,999
passwords in those credentials that were

494
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,099
lifted from the machine language from

495
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:34,129
that treasure trove and that's exploits

496
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:39,649
for sale so yeah stuff happens right but

497
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:41,989
this is what stuff happens looks like

498
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:47,149
when it's global financial well let's

499
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:50,468
talk about attitudes

500
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,260
so this is one reason why I don't sleep

501
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,810
all at night I don't know but maybe one

502
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,590
in five bank executives being able to

503
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,820
detective Reach is that like pigs

504
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,340
sniffing out truffles this is actually a

505
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,900
higher percentage than most children who

506
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:20,750
believe in Santa Claus and this one well

507
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,060
I'm sorry to say but you know that if

508
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,590
you cover your eyes it does not make the

509
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,650
bad stuff go away yeah the struggle is

510
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,130
real and I have done audits and I've met

511
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,470
those who swear by their methods over

512
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,780
best practices and they manage our money

513
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,780
and these are the things I have heard

514
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,400
over and over again by people who

515
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,160
honestly honestly should know better

516
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,790
I can't say more except that you find

517
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,850
Adobe in places you never ever should

518
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm going to take you through a little

519
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,970
tour of carven AK dry decks and lurk uh

520
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,390
show of hands who's familiar with these

521
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,830
or has heard of them okay these are some

522
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,410
Big Daddies of financial malware and

523
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:35,120
really good stories to tell and it's

524
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,850
continued to evolve and it's become more

525
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,860
sophisticated than when it first emerged

526
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,560
back in 2011 that was when it was known

527
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,680
as Primus I'm gonna give you a bit of a

528
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,390
history lesson because in history is

529
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,110
context we always need context that's

530
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,260
how we can build our patterns connect

531
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,050
the dots and try to best anticipate the

532
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,010
attackers next moment okay so some

533
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,520
hallmarks about draw about dry decks

534
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,780
it receives dynamic

535
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,600
configuration files it uses web

536
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,860
injections to steal money it infects USB

537
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,500
media and it hides the CNC servers

538
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,590
behind proxy layers all smart moves but

539
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,350
they're very good at it now it's not

540
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,260
unusual to see exploits fade away and

541
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,970
then they come back however I don't

542
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,920
think we're very good at expecting it it

543
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,450
seems like we get surprised every time

544
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,300
this happens for example Zeus thinks

545
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,750
does anybody familiar with Zeus as an

546
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,540
attack vector right so it came back

547
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,410
August of 2016 and went after Brazilian

548
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,410
banks interestingly enough coinciding

549
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,940
with the Olympics there's always a

550
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,590
reason

551
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,300
well that activity appeared to die down

552
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,570
and then interestingly enough IBM

553
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,820
x-force researchers discovered it at

554
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,420
work

555
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,350
newer refurbished going after specific

556
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,870
targets in terms of Canadian and

557
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,640
Australian credit unions credit unions /

558
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,430
banks why credit unions are smaller

559
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,140
smaller means they don't have as much

560
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,240
money they don't have the resources or

561
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,790
the mindset to really have the defenses

562
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,180
in place

563
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,690
it makes them excellent low-hanging

564
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,030
fruit right for the picking there were

565
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,130
about 33 URLs that they identified and

566
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,930
interestingly enough the attackers and I

567
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,370
guess this is part of it and this is why

568
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,960
we're looking for the patterns they were

569
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,060
using the same CNC service that had been

570
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,330
initially deployed back to 2016 for Zeus

571
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:47,570
Citadel attacks and remnant lurk well

572
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,060
this one's from Russia With Love it was

573
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,730
part of a cybercrime operation used in

574
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,770
the click-fraud back around 2011 again

575
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,660
the Russians are really good at this

576
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,420
stuff so the gang went after about 29

577
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,120
million in customer accounts and then

578
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,310
they got a little greedy and they went

579
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:09,770
after 39 million using false payment

580
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,210
transfers Oh does that sound familiar

581
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,770
it's a less Swift and those were blocked

582
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,350
so it got retooled and revamped to

583
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,320
exploit weaknesses in bank security of

584
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,280
which there are many

585
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,160
and it was coupled with the angler

586
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,420
export now there was an international

587
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,510
effort amongst law organizations that

588
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,340
actually succeeded in taking these guys

589
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,700
down and then the angler exploit

590
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,450
actually disappeared from view one

591
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,010
interesting point to note and this is a

592
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,220
score for the bank's they identified

593
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,580
this attack and actually changed their

594
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,490
defenses to recognize and meet it so yes

595
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,390
it can be done this is one case but it's

596
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,220
hope now Cisco Talos has identified that

597
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,500
the lurking was also involved with the

598
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,360
necker's botnet has anybody heard of the

599
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,070
necros botnet right okay good and it's

600
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,990
important because who's heard of walky

601
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,960
walky ransomware

602
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,179
it distributed locky ransomware along

603
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:25,130
with droid x banking malware okay and

604
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,530
that brings us to Dooku and file the

605
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,630
smeller who here has heard of file of

606
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,480
malware or had to even deal with it it

607
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,960
is scary freakin fascinating stuff and

608
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,700
it is derived from thing that brought me

609
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:40,970
here

610
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,300
Stuxnet which we've heard about one of

611
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,200
those offshoots so do goo 2.0 was

612
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,410
discovered by Kaspersky six months after

613
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,460
it had been residing on their networks

614
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,230
their corporate networks and this is

615
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,720
because it lives in the memory of the

616
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,260
computers so it's very hard to trace

617
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,940
anything that's memory resident we

618
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,640
understand how that works it's terrible

619
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,200
if you're trying to do forensics and we

620
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,820
need to do forensics in order to

621
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,809
understand what went wrong so when an

622
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,120
infected computer gets rebooted it

623
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,679
actually changes the name and you are

624
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,720
looking for the wrong thing it's already

625
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,929
over here given something else another

626
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,000
interesting point about Dooku is our

627
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,950
Dooku 2.0 is that the calling card has

628
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,040
to do with embedding PowerShell

629
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,720
into the registry to download as

630
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,030
meterpreter and this has become a trend

631
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,370
over this past year something very

632
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,370
interesting to note this is new has

633
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,380
anybody been following their parts have

634
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,190
you heard of silence so we all know the

635
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,760
importance of doing recon correct any

636
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,990
mission especially if you're on

637
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,910
offensive security you need to

638
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,120
understand your target the attackers are

639
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,250
excellent at recon and this gives them a

640
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,660
leg up on us now

641
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,990
what's key is while it looks like our

642
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,120
veena and it borrows from it it is not

643
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,520
carbon AK it's already had about 10

644
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,680
different banks that's attacked and it's

645
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,880
still ongoing it utilizes spear phishing

646
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,620
emails to download and execute the

647
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,110
droppers there's a backdoor which sends

648
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,570
the system information then malicious

649
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,500
code is delivered affected pres are

650
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,540
stolen everybody cries and it starts the

651
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,230
screens recording so yes everything

652
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,790
that's attached to the network that is a

653
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,360
screen is potentially activated to

654
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,220
record what the bank employees are doing

655
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,300
and this is how you gain initial access

656
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,110
very important point

657
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,370
does anybody have a guess as to what

658
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:02,500
this map is about there's chocolate I

659
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,940
will throw you a chocolate just because

660
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,750
okay what have I been talking about big

661
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,260
word starts with C anybody okay Oh

662
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,980
carbon a carbon arc yes so there's a

663
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,960
song that goes everything old is new

664
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,570
again and this is a case for carbon AK

665
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,420
in order to really understand attackers

666
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,370
what we need to understand is history

667
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,440
for the point of context to really

668
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,820
appreciate their pivots and finding

669
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,070
context within their past pursuits we

670
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,300
can get a sense of where they're headed

671
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,460
to next we need to be able to do that

672
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,909
now we've been watching carbon act pivot

673
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,969
from banking into hospitality and retail

674
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:00,050
it's gone after chimichangas it's gone

675
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,740
after our favorite fast-food places damn

676
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,380
them but yes because in this industry

677
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,090
which has far less money to spend on

678
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,880
securing itself low-hanging fruit is

679
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,350
always in season yes and we know that

680
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,500
cybercrime is based on efficiency it is

681
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,830
the perfect business model but carbon

682
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,240
arc is too established within the

683
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,120
financial realm to forever leave it so

684
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,290
they have been doing you know retooling

685
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,450
themselves and what they have done is

686
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,830
upgrade to exploit some of our favorite

687
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,740
tools who here does offensive security

688
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,950
pen testing so you know things like

689
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,860
Metasploit meterpreter veil and

690
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,960
PowerShell things that we used for the

691
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,020
powers of good they now use for the

692
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,620
powers of evil and the other thing is

693
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,880
that this is not signature based malware

694
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,779
so I'm sorry No

695
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:10,769
Junia you cannot use virustotal cuz

696
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,189
first key Symantec McAfee and God knows

697
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:14,699
what else

698
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:17,309
silence they're not going to pick these

699
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,949
things up anymore we can't rely on it

700
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:23,640
like we used to so we have to evolve

701
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,849
with these new attacks if we go looking

702
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,799
using these we are not going to find

703
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:34,009
them and honest to god they are in there

704
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:37,079
so I'm going to walk you through what is

705
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,619
essentially the pivot of carbon AK and

706
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,989
the operation gran Mars motive money

707
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:49,640
control and total ownership right

708
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,939
collaboration they do it better than we

709
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:58,140
do spider labs reports analyze this and

710
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,509
talked about how several groups came

711
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,549
together so that's different signatures

712
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:04,229
and you would only have known this if

713
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:05,369
you were tracking the different

714
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:06,779
signatures of these groups and

715
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:09,150
recognized those footprints in the

716
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,989
butter now there is still validity in

717
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:15,239
signature based identification if we're

718
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,640
actively monitoring it know what to look

719
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,489
for and what it's relevant to oh that's

720
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,409
a lot of work though and are we going to

721
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,059
get the backing from the people who will

722
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,319
pay for it I don't know they have to be

723
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:30,529
able to prove the validity of it

724
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:33,089
another point is being able to share

725
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,719
threat intelligence which again who here

726
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,849
is a proponent of sharing threat

727
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:43,799
intelligence who here thinks it's not

728
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:46,459
such a great idea

729
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:53,390
no share knowledge who here has a gag

730
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,740
order by their company that they're not

731
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,940
allowed to say what they think I'm so

732
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,859
sorry here have a chocolate okay

733
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,160
so yes you could be warned if you've got

734
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,369
the monitoring setup on your systems to

735
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,220
track for specific signatures number

736
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,920
three we know that this is the most

737
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,480
common attack vector this is how they

738
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,210
get out well how far would you be

739
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,200
willing to go to stop them at this step

740
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,480
does anybody here listen to the podcast

741
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,799
breaking down security with Brian break

742
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:38,640
all right he had a guest on recently I

743
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,799
love a lot of podcasts this is one of

744
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:44,130
them Michael Gough is an expert on

745
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,789
ransomware

746
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,190
he's given some really good talks and

747
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,680
one of them was about how he analyzed

748
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,559
the human factor now we all know that

749
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,749
the human condition is our biggest

750
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,089
challenge how the hell do we keep people

751
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:59,490
from clicking on things right that's it

752
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,859
that's the essence of phishing Michael

753
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,769
Gough said well maybe we we don't maybe

754
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,380
we just go one step above the humans the

755
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,880
way you could have baby gate up across

756
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,789
stairs and we make it so that it doesn't

757
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,980
matter how many times they click nothing

758
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,670
happens so he did an experiment over the

759
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,059
course of a year and he went into their

760
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,739
systems and enabled their systems to not

761
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,069
recognize that double-click now they

762
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:32,099
didn't lose business it was probably

763
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,710
very different for people people don't

764
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,960
like change and it was probably slower

765
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,509
or harder but the fact is it went from

766
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,569
like a ridiculous percentage of 60

767
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,680
percent down to 2 percent within a year

768
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,359
because the attackers realized and they

769
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,339
were measuring their statistics that

770
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,759
nothing was getting through they stopped

771
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,739
they stopped they found somebody else to

772
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,369
bother they moved on I would recommend

773
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:00,779
you listen to this podcast if you would

774
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:03,170
like to see how you might implement

775
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,220
out-of-the-box thinking because that's

776
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,119
what's gonna do it

777
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,989
and I thought it was fascinating

778
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,070
moving on they passed the hash for

779
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,100
privilege escalation we're familiar with

780
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,310
that step persistence

781
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,370
we're familiar with that part by a

782
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,490
scheduled tasks so if you're not really

783
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,410
looking at things if you're just

784
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,900
expecting to see things you're gonna

785
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,650
miss this

786
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,520
and then the attackers gain their domain

787
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,220
and admin in C&C points both in Europe

788
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,490
as well as the US then they leveraged

789
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:48,350
cloud services enterprise access who

790
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,130
here who here has to deal with the joy

791
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,240
of cloud services on a daily basis how

792
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,940
happy does that make you in your job who

793
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,710
here understands the concept of shadow

794
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,710
IT exactly so that if you are thinking

795
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,430
you have 60 cloud services how many do

796
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,730
you really have it's an exponential

797
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,290
number you've got 600 oh yes that is

798
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,420
what's going on and once it's like

799
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,700
Pandora's freaking box once it's out

800
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,290
there you cannot take it back

801
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,080
you cannot restrict it it exists and you

802
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,890
have to live with it

803
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,440
so the attackers built this malicious

804
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,809
code and it utilized the memory resident

805
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:45,039
PowerShell and JavaScript VBS right so

806
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,079
it's taking some tools that we all know

807
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,539
and are familiar with and turning them

808
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,369
to evil we've seen like TV movies about

809
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:53,769
people who've got red eyes blowing it's

810
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:58,150
kind of like that Metasploit powershell

811
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,440
veil

812
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,599
these are frigging powerful programs

813
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,190
when you are a pen tester they are

814
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,809
really good at what they do so in the

815
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:07,260
hands of somebody that you do not trust

816
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,599
it's a bad bad thing there was a remote

817
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:17,559
backdoor for data exfiltration and then

818
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:21,099
I hate this part valid Komodos

819
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:23,250
certificates for the whim

820
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,609
we've seen over the past several years

821
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:29,859
what happens with trusted certificates

822
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,319
what happens to companies that don't do

823
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,730
a good job managing their trusted

824
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,000
certificates you cannot really trust

825
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,230
trusted certificates is what I'm trying

826
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,410
to say and this is now part of a

827
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,349
systematic series of attacks against

828
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,369
hospitality but not just hospitality

829
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:52,539
this is going into retail point of sales

830
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,869
machines how many terminals are in one

831
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:58,920
Walmart how many Walmart's are out there

832
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,630
how many grocery stores are out there

833
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,529
and e-commerce so the target base is

834
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:08,380
massive and if you just do the numbers a

835
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,170
little bit of money over a lot of people

836
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,599
adds up fast

837
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,809
hackers are smart with math and then

838
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,339
finally they changed up the command and

839
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:20,650
control servers so they put one down and

840
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,539
take one up again to throw people off

841
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:26,819
the scent tricky but it worked

842
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,239
well we live by this saying don't we

843
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:36,289
it doesn't always play out so coming

844
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:39,650
back to my litany on trusted

845
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,640
certificates being not so trustworthy

846
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,200
does anybody have another example of

847
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,489
untrustworthy trusted certificates they

848
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:56,869
want to throw my way well is that thank

849
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:57,229
you

850
00:43:57,229 --> 00:43:58,549
very good come up you get a chocolate

851
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:02,180
when you win and when we're done okay

852
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,069
and there's been more we we have systems

853
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:10,910
in place with breaks that we cannot fix

854
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,609
this is a key example and then the long

855
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:17,710
game

856
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,890
patience perseverance persistence they

857
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,680
get in there and they have a long-range

858
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,130
plan key would be China and Russia

859
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,930
they're really really good at this and

860
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,299
the problem is once we realize what's

861
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,430
going on

862
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,499
we're already pawns in the game it's

863
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:38,390
already playing out and that has become

864
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:44,599
our reality I'm gonna take you now on a

865
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,200
world tour of cybersecurity as I see it

866
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,880
the intersection of global security and

867
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,420
information security this is the man of

868
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,599
the hour isn't it holy crow so just he

869
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,450
who has all of the money make all of the

870
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,749
rules well two hundred billion dollars

871
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:09,710
says that he thinks so and resources and

872
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:14,960
staging grounds matter so back in August

873
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,119
of this year the banks in the Ukraine

874
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,690
braced for yet another attack if you're

875
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,569
not familiar with what's going on with

876
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:26,420
the Ukraine essentially Putin is

877
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,779
old-school KGB he would like Russia to

878
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,329
become the Soviet Union once again and

879
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,579
pull back all of the pieces that left it

880
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,130
and one of those pieces for him is to

881
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,229
Ukraine and he has been going after that

882
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:40,040
like

883
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,590
dog with a bone since 2015

884
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:51,740
so I likened it to Putin's petri dish

885
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,340
his fiber experiments in the Ukraine are

886
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,680
netting results but what's he going to

887
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,170
actually leverage those results against

888
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,650
in terms of a bigger fish a bigger

889
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,380
quarry and this was on the heels of the

890
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,240
Pecha not Pecha outbreaks

891
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,980
let's do a little walkthrough

892
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,760
geopolitics and global finance China is

893
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,940
an interesting case in point it's been

894
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,350
steadily acquiring pieces of Africa and

895
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,650
it using that for its staging ground we

896
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,120
hear about it we read about it in the

897
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,020
news but really don't make the dots

898
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,600
Africa is volatile and for them China is

899
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,050
just one in a succession of colonial

900
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,650
takeovers that have left that continent

901
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,220
nothing more than warring factions

902
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,230
regardless it offers China geography and

903
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,450
resources which that nation needs and

904
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,680
will put to very good use North Korea

905
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,240
well we have been watching the news

906
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,600
reports it's small but it's volatile and

907
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,870
it's unpredictable and it is driven by

908
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,410
the desire of its leader to have nuclear

909
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:15,850
capability and be the top the kingpin of

910
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,940
that he has to be in with all of the

911
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,200
other players and he's not going to stop

912
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,290
until he gets what he wants it costs

913
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,390
money

914
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:29,860
Kim has stable falls of hackers at his

915
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,170
disposal at his service and as well

916
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:35,230
he's only too willing to take on the

917
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,220
dirty work drugs trafficking and things

918
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,960
that we don't even really want to think

919
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,030
about the rest of the world won't touch

920
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,640
but he and will do this to fund his

921
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,470
habits and now I've got an interesting

922
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,640
story to share I'm going to use the

923
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,940
Polish Bank attacks from earlier this

924
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,820
year and I'm going to ask was anybody or

925
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,340
has anybody followed that story from

926
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,590
about the beginning of February this

927
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,710
year attacks on the Polish banks anybody

928
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,510
else it's a good story okay so a few

929
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,850
banks in a small country will teach all

930
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,630
of us an important security lesson there

931
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,700
were a series of targeted malware

932
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,670
attacks against Polish banks now again

933
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,269
why Poland this is like a little country

934
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:31,069
it does it's it combines its own

935
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:33,799
business it's actually very good in

936
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:36,019
terms of security and bank security and

937
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:39,829
research and they discovered they were

938
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,480
being hit and believe me I was watching

939
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,690
because I have a bad Twitter habit then

940
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,380
crying out for attention and persistence

941
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,869
when these attacks were going on and

942
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,750
they were saying we're really good in

943
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,940
and what's happening and has anybody

944
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,829
else seeing this and the silence was

945
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:59,769
deafening

946
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:06,349
so the attackers went after the data the

947
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:08,779
data and not the money that's

948
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,599
interesting and they left a very

949
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,799
interesting trail of traffic in terms of

950
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:19,059
exotic locations and encrypted

951
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,260
executables that nobody had ever seen

952
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,769
before that's a rarity in our community

953
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:28,309
really to see unusual like malware that

954
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:30,049
nobody can say where this came from

955
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:32,119
there are a lot of very smart lines out

956
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,099
there they were coming up empty on this

957
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,650
one I was following the Twitter it was

958
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,799
2:00 in the morning okay and there were

959
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:42,529
unauthorized files on key machines

960
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:45,619
within the networks so nothing really

961
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,539
happened until a group of commercial

962
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:50,210
banks said hey wait hey wait we've been

963
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,730
attacked and then people started paying

964
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,549
a whole lot of attention they realize

965
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:56,809
there was a problem they follow the

966
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:59,990
trail and it led to a poisoned well it

967
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,569
was a web server huh within the

968
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:06,529
regulatory body of Poland's financial

969
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:10,130
sector the regulatory body was issuing

970
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,059
the crap now do you want to know what

971
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:17,109
the interesting part is

972
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,730
tada hahaha it's the Lazarus group again

973
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:32,970
holy crap these guys get around and we

974
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,550
still don't know exactly who they are so

975
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,520
according to semantics this is a threat

976
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,970
actor behind about targeted financial

977
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,730
attacks within 31 other countries from

978
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,710
October 2016 the Polish website that was

979
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,680
used to target the Polish banks was

980
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,930
delivering a particular strain of

981
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,210
malware that wasn't since Heston's been

982
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,180
identified to be part of the toolkit

983
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,690
known to belong to the Lazarus group so

984
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,790
there's there's three strains I'll tell

985
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,839
you the names of them if you want to

986
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,510
make notes back or finless doctor

987
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,530
philosophy and back door canto P but you

988
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,480
can read more about it the fact is at

989
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,210
the time it was happening nobody had the

990
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,230
same information to connect the dots did

991
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,170
you hear that other shoe drop mmm okay

992
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,790
so this is what it looks like it's not

993
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,950
just Poland that was being targeted

994
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,630
there were a hundred and fifty different

995
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,400
IP addresses and you can see they're

996
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,550
worth banks and institutions Mexico

997
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,900
Brazil Great Britain nobody's exempt

998
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,050
from this but it was Poland it was kind

999
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,450
of like a red herring so they would go

1000
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,940
after some other targets possibly more

1001
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,730
lucrative targets that cyber was one of

1002
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,000
the earliest blogs from a local guy in

1003
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,800
Poland trying to make sense of what was

1004
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,720
going on and asking why is nobody

1005
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,460
listening because we got a problem here

1006
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,910
and he said we need collaboration we

1007
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,730
need to share this threat information

1008
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,349
because we need to be able to identify

1009
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:14,550
it and put the pieces together so I'm

1010
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,829
going to share something that I noted

1011
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,869
that is trending and I'm going to ask if

1012
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,990
anybody else is familiar with it web

1013
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,390
application compromise how many people

1014
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,859
would say they've noticed a definite

1015
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:28,050
trend in this in terms of becoming a

1016
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,480
problem specifically targeting the

1017
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,719
financial sector

1018
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,189
well what's interesting is dark reading

1019
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:38,759
just recently issued a piece on it and I

1020
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:41,670
I know that I heard something on the

1021
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,699
podcast and read the Verizon data breach

1022
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:47,759
report earlier this year again that

1023
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:50,939
identified this as a growing trend much

1024
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:53,189
more of a threat to the financial sector

1025
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:56,910
and actually eclipsing if it's possible

1026
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:02,029
the human factor as a threat in breaches

1027
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:06,509
I'm going to move on now to Southeast

1028
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:09,869
Asia again another territory over and

1029
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:13,019
above Bank of Bangladesh bank heist ATM

1030
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:15,119
jackpot II who has heard of an ATM

1031
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,349
jackpot II this is a it's a pretty cool

1032
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:22,469
technique and the machines literally

1033
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:25,109
spewing the money out at you it's a cash

1034
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:29,039
grab that is a smart one and this was in

1035
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,829
a it was called the cobalt siege it

1036
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:34,859
covers a very wide swamp it is not

1037
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:36,929
limited to just a few countries we've

1038
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:40,009
got United Kingdom Spain Romania

1039
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:43,380
Netherlands Malaysia and much of Eastern

1040
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,829
Europe and it probably landed on the

1041
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:49,499
Americas it's been dubbed as the new

1042
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:52,559
model of organized crime because it

1043
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,349
really works and the FBI has issued

1044
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:58,469
warnings to US banks this past summer

1045
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:02,640
because of it then there were some DDoS

1046
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,609
attacks extortion accept attempts on

1047
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,459
several banks in South Vietnam by a

1048
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:11,160
group known as the Armada collective you

1049
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,809
may have heard of them they're known for

1050
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:14,880
issuing empty threats

1051
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,699
big breads nothing happens I'm just

1052
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:20,759
gonna say this where there's smoke there

1053
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:24,119
will be fire I wouldn't call them empty

1054
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,769
for a while and then there is Brazil I

1055
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:30,809
call it the Dark Horse because it's

1056
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,239
rather interesting it is the epicenter

1057
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:37,709
of where banking malware is formed it's

1058
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:41,429
mostly self-contained but it has a

1059
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:44,279
thriving industry in financial

1060
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,450
cybercrime

1061
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,460
this is the country where corruption is

1062
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,300
so entrenched they openly sell their

1063
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,000
crime wears on social media like

1064
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,490
Facebook is where you brag about the

1065
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,960
exploit you've built and how much it is

1066
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,589
for sale

1067
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:01,560
not only that they offer training

1068
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,260
courses for a few hundred bucks you can

1069
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,720
get a really good education and how to

1070
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,060
set up yourself in your own little crime

1071
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,339
wailmer malware shop and it's a booming

1072
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:16,170
business last but not least and I'll

1073
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,880
call this a game-changer for good reason

1074
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,210
we all know that CIA right

1075
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:25,579
confidentiality integrity availability

1076
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:29,010
this book turned on its head this past

1077
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:34,320
year by petra naw Pecha when

1078
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,930
availability because of ransomware has

1079
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,119
become the most serious issue we are

1080
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,010
contending with an availability isn't

1081
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,800
just something that affects business

1082
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,320
it affects hospitals it affects banks if

1083
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,430
we can't get our cash

1084
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,900
if we can't hook up to a life-support

1085
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,750
system if we can't heat our homes and

1086
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,319
it's 30 below yeah it really matters so

1087
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,420
what about the fact that the latest

1088
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,569
pivot and ransomware was not about the

1089
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:00,930
money

1090
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,089
it was never about the money it wasn't

1091
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:06,869
designed to get money it was all about

1092
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,839
attacking availability so money can't

1093
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,180
buy happiness but what if they cannot

1094
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,950
buy the essential or services that we

1095
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,280
all rely on Ukraine wasn't banking on

1096
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,030
that neither a week and this was a power

1097
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,599
play

1098
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,200
so integrity matters when you need to

1099
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,040
restore your data and your systems we

1100
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,260
know this is a problem DRC business

1101
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,910
continuity people really don't have

1102
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,140
plans in place and if they do they

1103
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,990
haven't necessarily tested them we have

1104
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,720
cloud services but have we actually

1105
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,599
checked to see how the data syncs up I'm

1106
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,190
asking this because I have a couple of

1107
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,140
friends who guard and test the

1108
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,119
mainframes who have worked in finance

1109
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,510
for 25 years who are tough guys and

1110
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,940
actually very scared about what they

1111
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,680
find on an ongoing basis

1112
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,110
we are not prepared for when we go to

1113
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,150
restore after but is a catastrophic

1114
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,120
event and the data doesn't think up

1115
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,520
because somebody has been nimbly moving

1116
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,850
through and exfiltrating one bit at a

1117
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:19,110
time and that's all it takes so that's

1118
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,500
pretty much it for me are there any

1119
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,350
questions comments you would like to

1120
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:30,810
share I know I'm kind of overwhelmed you

1121
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,540
or maybe it's the chocolate all right

1122
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,070
well this thumb it up yes

1123
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,160
it is interesting it's the case of the

1124
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,799
terrible parent the parent that will buy

1125
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:05,279
themselves a pair of Louboutins or a

1126
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:07,859
lovely Louis Vuitton handbag but their

1127
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,900
kids are starving it's exactly that

1128
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,990
mm-hmm yeah absolutely and I don't even

1129
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,190
think the hackers are making that much

1130
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,140
money they're scared and at least they

1131
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,490
have a roof over their head and food on

1132
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,480
their tables like other people don't

1133
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:29,059
remember Kim Jon had his brother killed

1134
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,839
so behaviors and attitudes are key

1135
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,190
understanding or did you have a question

1136
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,650
there is certainly I can speak to Canada

1137
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:25,150
a lot of companies the finance as well

1138
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:30,109
have been living under the they keep the

1139
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,670
secret to themselves it's a dirty little

1140
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,400
secret we now have a new data breach law

1141
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
coming in effect that they have to

1142
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,910
disclose when something happens this is

1143
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,710
going to be a really big awakening call

1144
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,019
for everybody because no you don't want

1145
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:43,250
to stay I got breached

1146
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,750
you don't want to say this was a problem

1147
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,750
you don't want to show your weaknesses

1148
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,789
also from a competitive advantage and

1149
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:51,579
profit building you don't want to share

1150
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:55,549
how you do business because you want to

1151
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:58,010
stay ahead of the path and that's that

1152
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:02,920
mentality that's enforcing behaviors

1153
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:09,250
yeah yeah

1154
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:19,140
no it's not my personal opinion it's

1155
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,380
gleaned from a lot of research and

1156
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,059
looking at what people are saying and

1157
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,369
connecting the dots and being able to

1158
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:29,400
say okay this keeps coming up when

1159
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,749
something keeps coming up we've really

1160
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:32,729
got an issue and it's being reinforced

1161
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:37,279
by numerous voices however we haven't

1162
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:41,970
recognized it because it's not as it's

1163
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,259
not as big

1164
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:45,180
it doesn't Trump it hasn't until now

1165
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,599
Trump Trump for example and like

1171
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,130
[Music]

1172
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,890
yeah

1173
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:43,190
so the sad truth about nation-states is

1174
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,410
we all know what they all know what each

1175
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,440
other is doing they are they are in

1176
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,099
league it's eye on each other lies if I

1177
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:55,579
on each other they're going to throw

1178
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,680
somebody else under the bus when they

1179
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,960
have to save themselves when there's a

1180
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,160
bully amongst the ranks nobody nobody

1181
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,750
questioned or stood up to Putin because

1182
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,309
they weren't willing to take the hit and

1183
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,650
they wouldn't unite as a collective

1184
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,559
because the risk was too high it's much

1185
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,210
harder to do this at nation state level

1186
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:23,059
okay I will share with you this last
