1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
oh how are you guys actually thank you

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,540
for bearing with us have a small

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,040
microphone problem with my problem okay

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,670
name Joe my name is Michael view I work

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,190
alongside Kevin at Sikich we're here to

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,770
talk today about making a thing create

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,930
professional quality embedded devices us

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,180
a little bit about ourselves like I said

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,859
my name is Michael view I work as a

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,960
penetration tester at an organization

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,420
called Sikich formerly for all three

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,759
labs if you've ever heard that name I'm

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,610
also an adjunct professor at a college

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,680
in my town where I live Milwaukee

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,010
Milwaukee School of Engineering we do a

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,300
lot of hardware hacking on the side just

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,829
for fun also work on the mini corner

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:47,820
project I don't know if anyone's

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,730
familiar with that particular Dropbox

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,809
we've kevin was a creator I'm now the

21
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,770
maintainer I guess we'll call it and

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,050
come in a night together both kind of

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,649
founded the mayhem lab project

24
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,719
I'm Kevin gone if the mic cuts out or

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,519
we're getting like wave your hands and

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,220
back so we know everything Mike said

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,270
Michael said and then we've done a lot

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,150
of these hardware hacking talks really

29
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,360
neither of us have a background in

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,500
electrical engineering circuit design

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,490
things like that

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,840
this has all been stuff we've learned

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,030
just like you know by the seat of our

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,040
pants pretty much and that's what we're

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,630
trying to share really is when I got

36
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,369
started in this it seemed like hardware

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,579
hacking was very intimidating like you

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,619
need you need equipment it's expensive

39
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,150
there's a lot of knowledge you need and

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,659
things like that

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,979
and what we learned is it's really not

42
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,600
the truth especially nowadays and we'll

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,070
learn to see a lot of that in the talk

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,450
so really what this is about is to get

45
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,920
people interested to see that it's not

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,960
that hard not that expensive to get

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,159
involved in doing this stuff yourself so

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,049
a little bit about SiC is since they're

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,420
paying us to be here today for this

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,470
conference which is a fantastic

51
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,990
opportunity we at Sikich are a

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,659
full-service IT consulting consulting

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,860
firm in general actually we do

54
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,320
information technology but also HR

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
related stuff tax Human Resources pretty

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
much any consulting that you might

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,800
possibly need SiC it's just sort of a

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,989
one-stop shop as Kevin and I already

59
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,800
mentioned we were

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,140
in the security compliance area where we

61
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
focused mainly on PCI style assessments

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,280
but we do a lot of other penetration

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,780
tests and hardware hacking as well so

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,850
quick agenda for today cuz we always

65
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,320
need one of these I want to talk about

66
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,610
kind of walk you through the process of

67
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,030
how we developed the product and a that

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,820
we came up with first things first we

69
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,380
always have to have an idea right what

70
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,120
do we want to make then we're going to

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
talk a little bit about circuit design

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,450
how we actually went about prototyping

73
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,640
it and and designing this thing and then

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,100
of course assembly so this is kind of

75
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,770
how our workday works I'm sitting at my

76
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,410
desk Kevin walks in and he says hey I

77
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,920
have an idea okay hey I want to buy

78
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,020
Chicken McNuggets sorry chicken nuggets

79
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,270
from some place with a with a sonic

80
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,040
screwdriver I'm like all right that

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,300
sounds neat because who doesn't want to

82
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,550
do that right walk into a store and pay

83
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,560
for something with a sonic screwdriver

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,540
so we're like but how do we do that

85
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,000
right so real quick to keep it short

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
this is the product that we actually

87
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,510
came up with I keep saying product it's

88
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,320
not it's a big spool for open source

89
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,430
it's a it's a small little handheld

90
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,750
device based on the herbs and we know

91
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,010
this is what we're basically going to be

92
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,260
talking about today how we ended up

93
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,209
making this thing and just to prove that

94
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,700
it actually does work it stores up to

95
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,850
five different credit cards and

96
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,040
basically mimics Apple pay or Samsung

97
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,560
pay through iam fields so so that's

98
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,760
kinda what we're gonna talk about is how

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,880
we came up with this device so of course

100
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,860
we started just like anybody else we

101
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,520
asked Google right how do how do we do

102
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,010
this thing so if anyone's familiar with

103
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,050
Sami

104
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,780
anyone seen Sammy's talk he's sort of

105
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,420
the founder creator of the make scooper

106
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,430
so we kind of stole his idea and warped

107
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,580
it a little bit excellent individual

108
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,760
we've got his uh information up here on

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,079
the slide so take a look at his

110
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,640
presentation that he gave I think it was

111
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,330
at Derby con two years ago yeah not this

112
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,120
year last year but we decided so his

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,600
third

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,250
in his presentation and think thinking

115
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,810
wow we need to learn a lot of different

116
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,430
things here so how do we go ahead and

117
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,260
build stuff because we've both soldered

118
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,610
things before we've done through a whole

119
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,790
design but how do we actually kind of

120
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,230
take this to the next level we want to

121
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,100
make a nice-looking product a big hurdle

122
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,990
for us was the surface mount soldering

123
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,520
which we'll talk about today how we kind

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,530
of overcame that in a relatively

125
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,410
reasonable budget and then also antenna

126
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,060
design we went through a lot of

127
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,250
different iterations and happy to talk

128
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,440
about it here or if you want to catch us

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,990
around the conference from got a very a

130
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,250
very ation of the different prototypes

131
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,870
that we did so happy to share those with

132
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,850
you guys and as Michael said we started

133
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,650
with the renal mag spoofer it was just a

134
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,450
more research project that this

135
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,880
individual had done the bank's before it

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,710
is pretty simple you're just creating an

137
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,510
electromagnet that oscillates it's

138
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,300
filled it in the same manner as the

139
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,680
electric field the electromagnetic field

140
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
but oscillate when you slide a credit

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,920
card so it seems like a pretty simple

142
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
thing but there's a lot of parts that we

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,090
had to kind of come up with to build

144
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,250
what we thought would be kind of a fully

145
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,900
featured product around or a fully

146
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,990
featured device around that kind of

147
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,040
basic fundamental idea you know so we

148
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,150
thought well we want to have Bluetooth

149
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,920
communication because we want to be able

150
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,750
to you know on our phone add new credit

151
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,640
cards or switch select which credit card

152
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,760
we want to use when we click the device

153
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
you know we had to figure out how we

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
have different controls to you know

155
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,590
click the button have it send a card

156
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,360
number or something I had to learn about

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,890
power regulation to run it for the

158
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,240
battery on this so it can be in our

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,490
pocket and just you know what is the

160
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,770
best way to get a really strong antenna

161
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,600
field like I said I wanted to walk into

162
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,120
McDonald into someplace and you know use

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
my sonic screwdriver around the payment

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,180
terminal but kind of do it the street

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,410
leaves so that people aren't asking what

166
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm doing so you need a little bit of

167
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,750
distance you need a pretty strong

168
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,730
antenna as well I thought it came up

169
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,770
with and so the first step of the

170
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,620
circuit design was really each of those

171
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,300
goals okay we've got a goal for power

172
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,220
regulation you go out on the internet

173
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
and say okay what's a good power

174
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,910
regulation circuit for in this case

175
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,400
we're using Arduino based circuit so

176
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,900
what's a good power regulation circuit

177
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,310
for that what components do I need and

178
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,600
you find you know you might find

179
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,310
diagrams like this one that shows the

180
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,930
power regulator and a few different

181
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,440
components

182
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,720
for that you know what's the best way to

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,330
drive this magnetic coil that we've

184
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,430
built well it turns out that coil is

185
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,490
just like the crow that you find in a

186
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,380
stepper motor so we actually use as a

187
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,730
it's called an h-bridge

188
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,560
but it's something used to drive well

189
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,820
not necessary couple more but used to

190
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,160
drive motors we're just driving magnetic

191
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,290
coil like we would a motor and then

192
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,600
there's the bluetooth module down here

193
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,260
you know those are available

194
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,560
off-the-shelf and so like how does that

195
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,750
connect the Arduino so really again

196
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,940
first step was getting a working version

197
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,730
of every single individual component and

198
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,260
then starting to put that together so of

199
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,460
course before we started ahead to build

200
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,230
things we need stuff to build stuff with

201
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,210
right so is anyone familiar with offer

202
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,830
stuff we all know different components

203
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,050
right LEDs so I'll describe watch all

204
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,770
that kind of good stuff

205
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,350
right okay has anyone ever heard of

206
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:40,110
Aliexpress I love that start right we

207
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,040
buy arduino x' by the dozens

208
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,970
mostly because some of them are broken

209
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,710
when they get here you know most of them

210
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,690
work so it's it's a great store to buy

211
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,820
things cheaply I don't know we were

212
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,230
struggling with our internet connection

213
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,560
so I'm not sure if it's going to work

214
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,830
there it is

215
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,620
oops

216
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,130
so this is one thing that we kind of

217
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,290
started to play with there's an Arduino

218
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,320
sensor kit out there if anyone's had an

219
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,790
opportunity to check this out comes up

220
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,940
with 37 different sensors of all various

221
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,490
different sizes and functionality I

222
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,240
should say but it's it's $11 shipped for

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
free you can't really beat that so this

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,610
is one of the things we kind of you know

225
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,600
kind of thinking about the different

226
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,309
designs we wanted to do when we boiled

227
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,229
it down to bluetooth and on our antenna

228
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,390
but we wanted to kind of explore what

229
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,679
are the other options so this is one

230
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,240
thing that we purchased to kind of just

231
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,190
play around with and see what's what

232
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,420
oops

233
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,790
internetting and a hacking dimension

234
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,850
never a good idea so kids what are you

235
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:08,050
gonna throw there all right so we can we

236
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,180
can easily find Arduino is out here as

237
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,260
well pretty much any shape and size

238
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,880
obviously grain of salt they are

239
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
knockoff Arduino it's not the real thing

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,330
right so obviously understand what

241
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,970
you're buying I always recommend buying

242
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,830
them in bulk so that way if one or two

243
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,660
doesn't work you're probably not gonna

244
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,020
get them like in a return to China but

245
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,480
maybe them from so then we selected a

246
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,350
couple of different art that we know

247
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,030
that seem to be the most popular ones

248
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,730
out there first off the Arduino Nano has

249
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,740
anyone ever used played with the Arduino

250
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,010
Nano yeah couple okay it seems to be

251
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,470
extremely popular the main reason is it

252
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,620
has a USB to serial adapter built-in

253
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,180
it's got a separate chip for that so

254
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,880
it's really simple to program the one

255
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,770
reason I personally don't like the Nano

256
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,020
is it has components on both sides we'll

257
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,210
talk about that in a little while why we

258
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,210
wanted it to be flat on one side for the

259
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,950
surface mounting so that's why we went

260
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,310
with the Arduino Pro it's a little bit

261
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,100
of a different chip design you can still

262
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,550
use use it as or you can so program it

263
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,470
through USB but it's a little bit more

264
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,180
difficult it does have a nose another

265
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,790
cool feature where it can actually

266
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,170
emulate like a hit device so we can

267
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,220
actually use these to make other

268
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,420
projects as well so

269
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,009
so kind of already explained this but

270
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,000
why did we choose our can we knows

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,769
they're inexpensive they're flexible

272
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,529
right we can kind of solder them and

273
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,000
mess them up and put them wherever we

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,560
want to put them and if we break one for

275
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,910
three dollars it's not that big a deal

276
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,279
also there's a huge community around

277
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,019
sample code out there right so it's

278
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,019
really really simple to go out and find

279
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,610
sample code because I don't really speak

280
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,509
see but it's not easy to do and one of

281
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,560
the other main reasons we chose the

282
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,360
Arduino is it's really easy to transfer

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
translate from prototyping using an

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,850
actual Arduino board to building like a

285
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,649
final product that just uses the bare

286
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,600
chip so every Arduino board has this

287
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,220
bare atmega chip there's different

288
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,250
versions but you can just you can build

289
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,660
your board around that chip there's a

290
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,269
few extra components you need I've got

291
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,649
those listed here you can find that

292
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,600
online and it's a little more difficult

293
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,550
to program when you go to the bare chip

294
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,980
then because you it doesn't come three

295
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,509
baked with the arduino bootloader that

296
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,850
lets you program via USB you actually

297
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,230
need this other device that got shown

298
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,149
here or a different variant of it called

299
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,630
an ISP programmer these usbasp at least

300
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,790
i think the the genuine one runs about

301
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,769
ten dollars and knock offs run just a

302
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,069
couple bucks but that's that's kind of

303
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:46,540
the next revision the board you're gonna

304
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,120
see here that we've built still has the

305
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,740
full arduino chip on it because it's

306
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,410
still kind of in a we considered a kind

307
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,569
of development board now you know it's

308
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,079
it's it's a programming testing tool but

309
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,670
you know we're thinking of the next

310
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,870
revision that's then going to have the

311
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,399
chip just on the board itself to make

312
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,040
like a very final product type look

313
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,220
so they're prototyping multiple stages

314
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,170
to get through that you may have seen

315
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,790
the solderless breadboard again I love

316
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,920
the Arduino Pro micros there's no nanos

317
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,089
because they plug right into these

318
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:23,089
solderless breadboards let you start you

319
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,560
know adding other components on pretty

320
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,670
easily to test your basic circuits out

321
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,080
definitely when I talked about testing

322
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,120
each individual functionality I'm

323
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,380
testing that on this side of this

324
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,270
breadboard just to say okay how does how

325
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,890
does this antenna coil work let's do it

326
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,240
here how does this work let's do it here

327
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
to figure out you know how I put the

328
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,779
parts together how we put parts together

329
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,600
you might then step up to they call this

330
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,470
proto board where it's a little more

331
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,510
permanent solution when you solder it

332
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,130
together if you I don't have a picture

333
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,390
the back of it unfortunately but if you

334
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,860
look at the back of this there'd be just

335
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,410
blobs of solder everywhere if you've

336
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,880
ever done this it's a little more

337
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,279
challenging than you might think it is

338
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,310
because making connections with blobs of

339
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,750
solder solder doesn't really you know

340
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,520
form like clay it kind of does what it

341
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,230
wants sometimes so the for a simple

342
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,520
circuit this proto board works pretty

343
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,200
well you know when we get to something

344
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,910
as kind of complex there's all the

345
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,260
components we've added on here

346
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
you know we skip this step this is a

347
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,060
little too complex to try and do and in

348
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,950
solderless then the proto board circuit

349
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,610
like like this so that's where you get

350
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,230
into okay let's skip that step and let's

351
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,450
start kind of designing a PCB a printed

352
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,860
circuit board and if you're not familiar

353
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,839
that's just this stuff without any

354
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,490
components on it is printed circuit

355
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:46,070
board so I'm gonna do a quick demo here

356
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,980
of Fritzing which is the program I use

357
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,140
to do that kind of circuit board design

358
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,580
so how many people have used Fritzing

359
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,250
before okay we got a few so hopefully

360
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,779
this will kind of get people interested

361
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,950
again not that difficult so this is

362
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,310
different board that we built for the

363
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,140
cipher con conference in Milwaukee their

364
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,650
theme was Morse or was Morse code so we

365
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,089
built a Morse code board that people

366
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,490
could actually build with the conference

367
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,839
and so I thought that it's a pretty

368
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,220
simple circuit it's only got a handful

369
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,810
of components I'd be a good one to show

370
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,620
some of the feature

371
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,220
of Fritzing and how to use it so the

372
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:36,860
first thing is so the first thing is we

373
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,660
wanted a custom shape on this one and

374
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,540
and you know luckily enough the the the

375
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,270
phablet manufactured in China who you

376
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,560
know you've ordered these boards from

377
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,210
literally charging more to have a custom

378
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,830
shape they just charge you by the size

379
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,589
of the shape itself so having a square

380
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,060
this big or having this custom shape

381
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,430
wasn't really much of a price difference

382
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,420
so he thought yeah let's do a custom

383
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,980
shape it's actually not that difficult

384
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,710
to do a custom shape you have to start

385
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,320
with vector graphic so we used Inkscape

386
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,420
to just create a bunch of this is a

387
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,040
bunch of rounded rectangles and ovals

388
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,690
and squares kind of stacked on top of

389
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,080
each other so I just kind of made that

390
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,400
supposed to look like a Morse code

391
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,300
keying device made that in Inkscape save

392
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,580
it an SVG and that's kind of one of the

393
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,770
first steps and Fritzing is to pull that

394
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,300
background in so you see that green

395
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,220
background there is the actual board

396
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,089
that we would be adding components to

397
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,500
once you've got that background

398
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,600
Fritzing has basically what they call

399
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,130
layers so if you start looking at some

400
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,750
of the layers and i'll turn them off so

401
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,660
they make a little bit more sense so the

402
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,430
black stuff we see here they call is the

403
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,110
silkscreen on the front so that's the

404
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,580
printing that actually goes on the front

405
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,070
we printed Morse code we printed this is

406
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,959
where the LED goes this is where the

407
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,540
speaker goes so we can you know turn off

408
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,320
that layer slip screen top layer other

409
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,060
parts we'll see here then we'll see

410
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,500
through holes where people might look

411
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,920
components you know here's here's the

412
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,350
grid for those components and then the

413
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,270
lines between them are called traces or

414
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,570
wires it's it's basically the electrical

415
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,850
connections the yellow ones are the ones

416
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,529
on the top of the board the orange ones

417
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,660
are on the bottom of the board so that

418
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,830
that's kind of what we're working

419
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,510
towards well how do we build something

420
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,830
like this

421
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,380
Fritzing has this big parts library so

422
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,720
we can go search it let's say we're

423
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,380
gonna search for an LED and it's going

424
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,060
to show us kind of all the LEDs it's got

425
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,390
in stock

426
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,420
and this was a through-hole project so

427
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,040
the different I've set up for so a

428
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,070
through-hole project like this port

429
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,410
means the holes go through the board and

430
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,390
you're you've got like an LED with with

431
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,920
wires on it who stick those wires

432
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,300
through the board and you solder on the

433
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,570
excuse me back of the board other

434
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,540
projects like like the max Cooper are

435
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,860
the surface mount which means the

436
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,480
components are smaller you set it right

437
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
on top the board and you kind of solder

438
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,510
them right to the top of the board so

439
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,050
that's the difference between

440
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,390
through-hole and surface mount we can do

441
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,190
both of them in Fritzing this one's a

442
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,730
through-hole design and so since the

443
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,530
through-hole design I've got to find of

444
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,030
through-hole LEDs so if I mouse over

445
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,030
this LED we see that there are two

446
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,500
little yellow squares which tells me

447
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,730
it's a surface mount it's got two

448
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,770
surfaces for mounting that led I'm

449
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,329
looking through a through-hole LEDs so

450
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,310
that's this one it shows you know the

451
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,530
two little through holes there down in

452
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,080
the corner when I mouse over which means

453
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,910
that's the shape I want we got to find a

454
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,440
place to put this we'll just put it

455
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,430
there so that's how we can place things

456
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,010
I'm going to get rid of that subscreen

457
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,650
top layer again so I have to look at it

458
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,380
but now we've got that piece placed now

459
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,430
we need to make the electrical

460
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,300
connections for it so this square box

461
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
needs to go to ground actually they've

462
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,130
left that's still between top layer up

463
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,920
because I know that this is ground right

464
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,720
here so I know this connection can need

465
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,110
to go to ground and this connection is

466
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,660
going to need to go to I want so let's

467
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,220
say this LED lights up when we turn the

468
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,620
power on so that's gonna be when I turn

469
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,530
the power on it to switch gear all right

470
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,150
well you can see that that those wires

471
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,320
aren't going to be good they're crossing

472
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,730
other wires they're making electrical

473
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,330
connections

474
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,030
well printing can solve that for us by

475
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,650
auto routing those so I'm going to set

476
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,730
these and tell them that they should

477
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,500
auto route by just turning off do not

478
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,550
auto route and then if i push this auto

479
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,050
route button and everything we're

480
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,060
supposed to do now to routed some other

481
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,220
things to put in turn those off but you

482
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,550
can see it's created two orange wires on

483
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,750
the back of the board for those two

484
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,160
connections then actually don't even go

485
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,900
to where I set them to they went to some

486
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,740
place more convenient

487
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,150
if we want to look at that a little

488
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,230
better I'm gonna turn off the silkscreen

489
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,020
I'm gonna turn off the copper top layer

490
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,880
and I'm going to turn the board around

491
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,210
so I'm looking at the back so here's

492
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,610
that LED I just added you can see it

493
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,740
created this trace that connects over to

494
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,270
you know some other connection that

495
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,250
already existed that what goes on when

496
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,440
the power goes on and this trace goes

497
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,140
over here so this is ground and Fritz is

498
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,670
actually pretty nice if I click on one

499
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,530
of these components it's gonna highlight

500
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,210
every other component it's electrically

501
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,980
connected so I could trace that back and

502
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,390
see yep it's definitely connected to the

503
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,670
ground this one yep it's definitely

504
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,390
connected to one powers on so that's

505
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,600
another nice feature there so that's

506
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
kind of how we go about adding

507
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,050
components and there's there's you know

508
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,890
a pretty big black library the like I

509
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,460
said there'd we know chip is the and

510
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,150
we'll do it Stalin Oh

511
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,309
before

512
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:52,919
so the Arduino should be a 328 we should

513
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,649
be able to find one of those here so

514
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,269
there's an atmega 328 so we could even

515
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,999
you know add an atmega processor and

516
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,950
that's how that was and then we again

517
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,840
just select reconnect the individual

518
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,059
pins to whatever parts it needs to be

519
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,840
connected to so that's kind of the

520
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,289
process to again add components

521
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,269
you know what would Michael and I like

522
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,119
to do when we build one of these is

523
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,169
actually go through and take our time

524
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,210
and kind of line up all the wires so

525
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,379
they look nice this is a very calming

526
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:27,929
therapeutic activity that I could just

527
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:30,570
do for hours like straight and wires

528
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,599
yeah it's it's it's very very very

529
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,769
satisfying but once you've done that now

530
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,289
you can export it so we're gonna go

531
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,639
through the steps of exporting this like

532
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,109
we're gonna ship it off to the lab in

533
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,849
China to have it fabricated and then

534
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,289
I'll show you how we can kind of verify

535
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,879
and test that it looks pretty good too

536
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,029
so exporting it is actually simpler than

537
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,339
you would think too if I've done this

538
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,960
through Eagle 2 which is a more

539
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,489
professional program for doing this and

540
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,139
there's a few more steps involved and so

541
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:59,729
that made it a little intimidating again

542
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,859
but Fritzing really makes it easy

543
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,679
it's file export for production extended

544
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,059
Gerber and it's just going to ask me

545
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,549
where do you want to put this we'll make

546
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:17,418
a new folder here

547
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,529
we're going to say export a production

548
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:22,789
and put all the files in that demo

549
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,000
folder so what that actually creates for

550
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,870
us we go look at that folder is a number

551
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,870
of files each one corresponds to one of

552
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,580
those layers we were looking at so

553
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,289
there's a file that's the contour which

554
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,610
is the outside shape of the board

555
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,889
there's a file for the copper bottom a

556
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,769
file for the copper top and you know to

557
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,240
you and I that the contents of these

558
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,799
files are pretty meaningless it's a

559
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,039
vector instruction file but to be

560
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,570
definitely good to look at these files

561
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,029
before we ship it off to see if it

562
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,830
actually looks like what we expected it

563
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,509
to there's another program out there

564
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,200
called curb view that lets us do that

565
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,429
through the Gerber files that's why it's

566
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:03,620
called curb view so I'm going to go and

567
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,710
open that up in your view Lowe's Gerber

568
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,799
file we'll find that folder

569
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,950
if I open all those it's gonna pop that

570
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,250
board and all its layers right in and it

571
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,080
looks kind of messy and herb used so far

572
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,279
because it doesn't really understand as

573
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,289
well as Fritzing did but we can use this

574
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,779
to kind of peel it apart and understand

575
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,590
it better make sure it is what we want

576
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,210
so you know this layer clearly is the

577
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,799
outside shape and the outside shape

578
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,360
looks good it's solid I don't see any

579
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,019
problems with that this layer appears to

580
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:47,230
be the top traces so you know again this

581
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,820
is raw what's getting sent to the

582
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,590
manufacturer so this is a good chance

583
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,879
for me to go and say well that's a

584
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:53,710
pretty thin line there maybe I should

585
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,259
modify where this wire goes so I don't

586
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,299
have such thin lines in between cuz I

587
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,879
don't like those square this one off you

588
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,440
know so I can see mistakes that I've

589
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,230
made or things that I want to touch up

590
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,250
you know and I can go through each layer

591
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,870
and kind of confirm that so here's

592
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,970
here's the layer with some of the holes

593
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,009
and the the top are on the back of the

594
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:16,090
board there's gonna be a silkscreen

595
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,850
layer there so I can actually see you

596
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,320
know the silkscreen line up where it's

597
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,490
supposed to go here I think I would you

598
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,720
know even though I've got the LED on the

599
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,820
part it's label is actually off the cart

600
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,590
I'd have to go back and fix that so

601
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,269
that's kind of what group you does for

602
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:29,590
us let's just kind of go through and

603
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,389
confirm that every layer looks pretty

604
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:35,549
good before we send it off to fabricate

605
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,080
but once we've done that once we've you

606
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,759
know I usually take three or four times

607
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,529
around before I actually get a set of

608
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,230
Gerber files I'm happy with then you zip

609
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,909
this up and it's ready to send off with

610
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:49,320
your order to have these fabricated

611
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,590
so that was our demo not too much went

612
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,770
wrong

613
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,460
oh and hitting a little ahead of myself

614
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,400
so you could also use Fritzing to

615
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,230
instead of sent it off for fabrication

616
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,590
you could use it to create print down at

617
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,180
your own PCB I've done this a couple

618
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,610
times you know just a high-level the

619
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,770
process as you get for that's just

620
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,510
cladding hopper covered in copper and

621
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,070
you get some chemicals that dissolve

622
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,710
copper and then you get some paper you

623
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,520
can use specialized paper or magazine

624
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,470
actually paper like color glossy paper

625
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,480
from agony magazines actually works but

626
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,730
you print on the paper you iron the

627
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,800
printer ink from the paper onto your

628
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,660
board that's the black stuff you see

629
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,910
here and then you drop it in the etchant

630
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,530
to try and dissolve all the copper where

631
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,540
the black stuff isn't this is the

632
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,220
example of a board where that was almost

633
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,340
done but I pulled it out too soon but

634
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,720
after you do that then you have to wash

635
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,660
off where the black is were to expose

636
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,460
the rest of the copper drill the holes

637
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,820
manually it works and a lot of people

638
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,990
have done it for a lot of a lot of years

639
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,390
I skip this step now when we build

640
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,640
something because it's so cheap and so

641
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,350
fast to just have somebody in China

642
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,100
built a printed PCB for me instead of

643
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,080
going through all this effort even if

644
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,990
it's just you know one or two prototypes

645
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,710
but it still can be done but that's when

646
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,220
we get to kind of fabricating so now

647
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,470
that I like Kevin do all the heavy

648
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,860
lifting

649
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,570
um and get my hands dirty with keyboards

650
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,010
so now we get into the fabrication and

651
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,800
design as Kevin mentioned earlier we had

652
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,090
gone through a couple of different

653
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,880
iterations of boards I guess this would

654
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,720
be version three that we're at what that

655
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,920
we're on right now we went through

656
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,320
several different antenna styles as well

657
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,670
so it was one of our other big

658
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,590
prototyping challenges is what kind of

659
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,720
antenna do we need what size how many

660
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,720
wraps how much you know how hard in

661
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
speed running through the antenna what

662
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,810
kind of range can we get etc so there's

663
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,750
a lot of experiments around that this is

664
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,370
one of our earlier designs we went with

665
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,460
sort of a like a diamond or a square

666
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,260
shape to see if we could get a better

667
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,730
range

668
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,440
and then eventually you figured out that

669
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,120
it would work just as well as when we

670
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,149
had it flat maybe a little bit wider so

671
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,110
that's sort of the design we ended up

672
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,880
going with because then it it fits a

673
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,500
little bit nicer in a carrying case or

674
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,549
in your pocket or something like that

675
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,970
then kind of people get in your way so

676
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,470
this is these are just two examples of

677
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,860
early prototyping as Kevin mentioned you

678
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,000
know I think he's going to talk about

679
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,070
some of the the pricing later and how we

680
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,840
actually had these prototypes so quickly

681
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,360
but instead of itching our own or doing

682
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,970
the proto quartz we were able to have

683
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,269
these fabricated from China using the

684
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,309
the same techniques that that Kevin just

685
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,830
showed us and we had these relatively

686
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,350
quickly and you know you look a little

687
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,950
bit clunky

688
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,299
they're obviously much bigger than the

689
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,000
final product but they were our first

690
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,880
prototype up you already went over

691
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,110
exporting and Gerber you stuff so let's

692
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,330
get that Oh ordering so now we're ready

693
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,730
to order our device and again this was

694
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,139
one of the things that was intimidating

695
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,789
like what am I going to screw up how

696
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:09,960
does this work

697
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,500
then I found like was actually absurdly

698
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,529
easy we order a lot of stuff through PCB

699
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:19,049
way now but I've used other houses out

700
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,399
there as well and I've had pretty much

701
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,100
similar experience across the board we

702
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,539
use nice view it one of the reasons is

703
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,799
because they have this deal they've

704
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,120
always had it for like last couple years

705
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,470
that $5.00 for 10 forts to get you in

706
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,659
the door you'll find the 10 boards it's

707
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,700
actually like $20 so they're 20 boards

708
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,039
is actually like $20 and we can actually

709
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,710
see that here yeah no not free shipping

710
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,970
so it's pretty easy though to figure out

711
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,380
okay I've built this board and I know

712
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,120
what size it is what's it gonna cost to

713
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,590
have them print it and ship it to me

714
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,710
let's say it's you know 50 millimeters

715
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,220
by 50 millimeters and we just want 10 of

716
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,669
them and the standard two layers to two

717
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,679
layers means we've got copper on both

718
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,889
sides which is pretty standard in the

719
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,419
1.6 moment your thickness is pretty

720
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,690
standard

721
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,659
as long as we've got some internet here

722
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,350
still we're having some internation yeah

723
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,139
it's still working okay but they've got

724
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:24,029
a lot of choices for us at this point

725
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:25,620
but they're all pretty straightforward

726
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,000
and defaults and most cases are just

727
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,549
fine you know the board type is a single

728
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:30,659
piece we're going to have them cut out

729
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,240
the boards for us there's just one

730
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,250
design in our panel so it's it's you

731
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,860
know ten of the same thing basically

732
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,940
already told them the size and the

733
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,169
number the layers you know you just want

734
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,269
the standard board type I don't even

735
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,590
know what this means I've never looked

736
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,149
it up you can choose different

737
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,500
thicknesses get a little thinner a

738
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,029
little thicker it gets more expensive if

739
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,590
you choose the the outliers you can

740
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,080
choose a different track spacing six mil

741
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
is it's actually pretty small already

742
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,029
you know these get more expensive

743
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:04,889
because they're they're very tiny traces

744
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,669
and very much higher standards

745
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,230
everything I've built that I can I up

746
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,669
like that looks like there's enough

747
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,350
space there has always been fine at six

748
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,559
mil you know men whole size again that's

749
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,690
0.3 millimeter is it's smaller than any

750
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,000
hole that we've created ever to date so

751
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,289
again all the standards are pretty good

752
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:23,669
you can but it's even nice you can

753
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:26,669
choose like different colors of board

754
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:27,690
and that doesn't even change your

755
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:33,330
pricing really and as you can see my

756
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,070
pricing there is just five dollars for

757
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,470
those ten boards and then that's $21

758
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,899
shipping which hurts a little bit but if

759
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,490
I were to try and you know H these

760
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,809
that's like probably an eight-hour

761
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,610
process to etch just a few of them

762
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,580
versus $21 and the other really awesome

763
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,350
thing that just floors me every time is

764
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,440
that you know they show that this is DHL

765
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,669
shipping you're paying but it's the only

766
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,710
choice you have but they're fabricating

767
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,720
it in three to four days and they're

768
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,340
shipping in three to four days I've

769
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,960
consistently had these on my doorstep

770
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,629
like ten days after I place the order

771
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,159
like they're creating it in China

772
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,539
they're shipping it over and there it is

773
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,549
on my door and like less than two weeks

774
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,610
which is just it's crazy you know it

775
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,080
annoys me because I just I'm always

776
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,669
thinking like I had submitted an order

777
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,629
two weeks ago I have it today but yeah

778
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:20,190
that's that's as simple as it is it's

779
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,529
it's filling up the cart like this the

780
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,150
next steps from here you

781
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,670
just to your cart when you pay for it

782
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,940
they have you attach those Gerber files

783
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,750
or you just attach your zip file and

784
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,450
then in within a day they'll open up

785
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,010
that Gerber file they'll look through it

786
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,330
and they'll get in touch with you if

787
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,580
there's any issues like oh this file

788
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,530
type wasn't right or these things

789
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,390
overlap you should fix this we can't do

790
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,640
this so they do a quick quality check

791
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
look it back to you again listen add a

792
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,600
typically and then you say accept go and

793
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,270
ten days later these pretty cool pretty

794
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,490
cheap words are on your doorstep you can

795
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,560
see this was what 26 dollars for ten

796
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,240
boards so two dollars and sixty cents a

797
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,660
board for a batch of ten but yeah if we

798
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,080
even go up to like a hundred you know

799
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,210
eighty five dollars so 85 cents a board

800
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,710
to get a hundred of these on my doorstep

801
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,150
in ten days it's crazy

802
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,750
the only caveat with ordering stuff from

803
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,210
I've had challenge I've had with

804
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,399
ordering stuff from China is to not

805
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,629
order around the Chinese New Year

806
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,549
because it's not ten days then it's like

807
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,799
six weeks and ten days they're just gone

808
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,139
for six weeks is what I found

809
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,600
of course Kevin makes me put everything

810
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,330
together he says I do a better job but I

811
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,420
just don't think he likes doing it so we

812
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,550
just talked about outsourcing which is

813
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,660
not too bad

814
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,720
obviously we have our PCB created

815
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,960
through PCB way relatively cheaply and

816
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,590
now the task comes for us at least do we

817
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,950
want to assemble these things ourselves

818
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,480
because we've got what but a half dozen

819
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,390
or so surface mount components on it

820
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,190
we've got a battery on the back and you

821
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,280
know have to wind the the antennas so it

822
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,830
was a labor of love let's say to try to

823
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,730
make this thing to make it work so the

824
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,410
big question for us is do we want to do

825
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,970
it ourselves we actually want to produce

826
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,970
these in any particular scale or do we

827
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,620
want to have somebody else do it for us

828
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,380
right how much costs do we want so real

829
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,880
really easily we're sort of talked about

830
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,100
this but we've got our PCB our blank PCB

831
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,310
on the on the aside on the left side and

832
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,640
then we have one with components we've

833
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,020
found that actually surface mount

834
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,540
soldering is relatively easy and I think

835
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,740
it intimidates a lot of people so

836
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,140
hopefully with a couple of tools and

837
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,970
after this talk will encourage more

838
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,280
people to this charter to start fires in

839
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,460
their living rooms please don't do that

840
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,520
but the the easiest thing for you to do

841
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,020
is keep all of your components on one

842
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,610
side if you ever look at an embedded

843
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,320
device like a router or whatever have

844
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,570
you you'll notice that there's a lot of

845
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,430
surface mount components on both sides

846
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,490
of a PCB board right if you want to do

847
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,830
it yourself that can be sort of

848
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,380
disastrous we we start off with some

849
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,330
early designs where we had multiple PCB

850
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,950
boards kind of stack on top of each

851
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,230
other where if you like this one we've

852
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,760
got the Arduino and the Bluetooth module

853
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,890
while those two modules came to us

854
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,750
already pre soldered with service mount

855
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,430
components on it so if we wanted to

856
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,230
serve a smelt that component onto our

857
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,360
board it would liquefy all the other

858
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,890
side er of their surface mount

859
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,930
components right so then a guy the

860
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,610
extremely challenging so if you've got

861
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,440
components on both sides you have to

862
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,540
figure out how are you going to solder

863
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,270
on two sides of a board right which

864
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,110
actually is a little bit more

865
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,360
challenging than you think so what we

866
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,700
ended up doing is because because it's a

867
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,390
build

868
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,160
stuff on a budget this is basically what

869
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,530
we came up with is you need some kind of

870
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,910
solder paste right and quit chip is

871
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,909
fairly inexpensive so 15 bucks and yeah

872
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,960
that's that stuff right there it comes

873
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,790
in a little syringe

874
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,300
we've actually got stuff with led yes

875
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,610
lead or let free thank you great part

876
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,620
there we found this stuff with lead

877
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,090
actually works better just you know

878
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,360
don't lick your fingers when you're done

879
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,580
you'll need an electric frying skillet

880
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,929
if you're gonna borrow your wives or

881
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,550
girlfriends or whoever's just make sure

882
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,190
you don't cooking it again because it is

883
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,310
well let it solder I highly recommend a

884
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,659
metal spatula don't try to use a plastic

885
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,719
one trust me you're gonna need some kind

886
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,130
of aluminum foil doesn't really matter

887
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,649
what and then I recommend a good set of

888
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,320
tweezers so we found like a jeweler set

889
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,030
of tweezers works really well for you

890
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,409
know 10 bucks or something like that so

891
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:57,160
all from aliexpress of course all in I

892
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,020
think we're like about 63 ish dollars

893
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,360
right give or take depending on how much

894
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,350
you spend on each other so really simply

895
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,060
you preheat the the frying skillet

896
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,070
well that's happening you take your

897
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,790
board I don't I don't think I've brought

898
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,890
any down with me or in my room if any

899
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,300
wants to see a bear board I do have them

900
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,950
but basically on all the pads you take

901
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,700
your little syringe of solder solder

902
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,350
paste it's actually solder and flux

903
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,730
combined so it's kind of like a

904
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,520
toothpaste Eve mixture and you basically

905
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,520
put little drops on each pad extremely

906
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,410
little dress on each pad because a

907
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,060
little drop goes a very long way and

908
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,130
then you take your tweezers and you sit

909
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,080
there and you put all the components on

910
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,850
and then you decide that hope that

911
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,110
components backwards so then you flip

912
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,760
all the components around or you know

913
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,410
you drop a component on crooked and you

914
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,830
say bad words what you want to do with

915
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,390
the aluminum foil we found works really

916
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,850
well as you make a pad a few inches

917
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,380
larger than the component that you're

918
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,760
soldering so it's I don't know maybe six

919
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,400
or seven folds of aluminum foil and

920
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,840
you're making a little bed for it to sit

921
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,250
on we found this really helped to

922
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,260
dissipate the heat and solder is that

923
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,920
much more evenly so then you place the

924
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,460
had into the frying pan along with the

925
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,609
components so and then of course

926
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:23,230
magic magic ensues as for some imagery

927
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,809
for you on the left hand side just Rob

928
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,760
pads on the right hand side we actually

929
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,799
have little dab of solder you'll notice

930
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:32,230
how small the little dabs of solder

931
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,480
actually are we have seen videos of

932
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,030
people being able to put sort of large

933
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,040
blobs of solder across an entire chip

934
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,619
like from left to right but I did not

935
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,270
have success with that I spent a lot of

936
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,460
time desoldering all the bridges that I

937
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,920
ended up making so this seems to work

938
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,960
it's a little bit more putzie but it

939
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
seems to work a lot better and then of

940
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,420
course we slap the components on again

941
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,099
on the Left we've got the raw components

942
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:59,559
just sitting there on top of the solder

943
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,290
with flux and then after after the

944
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,150
soldering process that's what they look

945
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:13,869
like on the right and I don't see demo

946
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:21,400
fail so I made mostly except I was a

947
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,829
really bad idea to bring in a hot frying

948
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:25,990
pan and put something on stage so I

949
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,780
don't know so that's just a real quick

950
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,390
example of you know putting the solder

951
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,069
paste on putting the phones up there if

952
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:35,200
you look right here at this chip you'll

953
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,559
notice it just starts to melt and it

954
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,270
just sort of wants to suck itself in and

955
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,520
it actually straightens the component

956
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,290
right onto the pads pretty nice you'll

957
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,780
notice the top capacitor there is gonna

958
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,250
do the same thing in just a moment a

959
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,890
blob of solder is gonna go away and by

960
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,089
looking at it you're gonna you're gonna

961
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,770
know that it worked because it's gonna

962
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,650
turn from a dull gray to a nice shiny

963
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,089
silver like you would expect a copper

964
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:04,690
and again on the on the chip right here

965
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,859
you're gonna notice on the right hand

966
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:09,609
side and there that goes that's me

967
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:10,630
stepping in front of the light because

968
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,109
I'm smart and then all the other side

969
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:17,079
just gets sucked right up so it's it's

970
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,369
pretty nice so as you're sitting there

971
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:19,980
watching it

972
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,000
haven't found too much of an issue

973
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,890
leaving it in the pan for an extended

974
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,210
period of time you know I mean if it's

975
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,070
sitting there for

976
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,080
a minute or two doesn't seem to damage

977
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,340
any of the components not that I've been

978
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,990
able to tell but that's pretty much yet

979
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,149
[Music]

980
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,490
yeah so it takes a couple of minutes

981
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,750
obviously what I do again but the the

982
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,310
tinfoil pad in there put them component

983
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,110
onto the pad I actually put the glass

984
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,050
cover back on to retain some of the heat

985
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,100
let it sit in there for a few minutes

986
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,810
and then all of a sudden you'll just

987
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,340
notice after a few minutes of sitting

988
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,420
there doing nothing and you're thinking

989
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,000
to yourself is it gonna happen all of a

990
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,180
sudden it just just magic and all sudden

991
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,650
they're all soldered it's it's really

992
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:09,410
cool good question I measured it at

993
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,940
about 500 degrees I think it actually

994
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,460
says 400 on the dial is the actual

995
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,870
frying pan but when I measured it with a

996
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,840
thermometer it said 500 some yep exactly

997
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,720
yep that was the video if anyone's

998
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,020
interested the video is online if you go

999
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,240
to youtube and google the mayhem lab

1000
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,860
you'll find us along with some other

1001
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,720
videos that we've done as well but

1002
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
that's out there for you to enjoy it's

1003
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,710
not as good as the last cat video we saw

1004
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:48,010
but it's up there oh yes

1005
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,800
so so then we we thought let's let's

1006
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,330
figure out what okay you know if we were

1007
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,470
ever to make want to make like a

1008
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,850
professional product like this would we

1009
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,170
sell we probably don't want to be you

1010
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,750
know what building in the skillet in the

1011
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,910
basement what would it take what does it

1012
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,350
look like to have you know somebody

1013
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,020
fabricated stuff for us so we have a PCB

1014
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,180
way again they've got like a quote thing

1015
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,340
there for you know what does it actually

1016
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,470
have us assemble your device but their

1017
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,790
quote isn't really realistic there

1018
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,780
because they have to do a lot of

1019
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,400
research and manual labor on the

1020
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,590
background to get you a real quote so

1021
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,780
the process was I gave them the first

1022
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,270
designs and kind of my bill of materials

1023
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,950
and they came back with a lot of

1024
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,330
questions and they wanted a very

1025
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,790
detailed bill of materials you have to

1026
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,990
tell them whether you're gonna send them

1027
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,480
the components in the parts or whether

1028
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,890
they're gonna buy the components in the

1029
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,910
parts when we thought well you guys

1030
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,990
should just buy the components in two

1031
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,860
parts because you know what's going to

1032
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,470
work for you so there was probably a

1033
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,420
couple weeks of back and forth to try

1034
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,620
and get all that information worked out

1035
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,510
and it wasn't like we could just give

1036
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,590
them the design and to give us the

1037
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,360
finished part they actually wanted to

1038
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,530
see photographs

1039
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,540
of a finished part so that they could

1040
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,800
make sure that they're orienting the

1041
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,300
components the same way and all that

1042
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,090
kind of stuff but once we got through

1043
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,060
all that it costs about $300 for this

1044
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,700
order for 20 assembled boards which

1045
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,530
comes down to about 15 dollars for each

1046
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,200
board which is you know outside our

1047
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,640
budget for kind of playing with stuff

1048
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,950
but if again if we were to try and you

1049
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,990
know make a product like this you could

1050
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,650
definitely sell for more than $15 and

1051
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,940
you can see how ten how that broke down

1052
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,920
they bought the part that wasn't very

1053
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,420
expensive most of that was in their

1054
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,280
assembly and this was for them

1055
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,410
assembling eight of the service mount

1056
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,900
components when it when it got to us we

1057
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,470
were adding other components in the

1058
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,900
antenna and stuff like that and it took

1059
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,490
quite a bit longer as well it wasn't the

1060
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,520
10 days it was probably about four weeks

1061
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,470
to get these on our doorstep I probably

1062
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,510
would do it again though if we had a

1063
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,160
good finished design I think it worked

1064
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,150
out well for us but I find that the

1065
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,560
surface mount soldering is actually

1066
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,730
really easy because I just give stuff to

1067
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:57,710
Michael and he does it so that's the

1068
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,080
presentation well hang out here for a

1069
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,380
few few minutes for questions but also I

1070
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,140
brought along a lot of the other stuff

1071
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,550
that we've kind of built over the last

1072
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,240
couple years I've got what is this this

1073
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,310
is a micro makey I don't even promote

1074
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,280
the makey makey it's a little device

1075
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,370
that psycho toy you build but the heart

1076
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,900
of its an Arduino so this is a little

1077
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,400
board that you can attach an Arduino to

1078
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,380
and attach the resistors to and make a

1079
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,950
making a key toy this board is an RFID

1080
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,140
spoofer so you attach an Arduino to it

1081
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,130
and a magnetic coil to it and you can

1082
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,290
spoof like the card readers in like your

1083
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,870
card reader with the Arduino this one is

1084
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,570
called in a pirate hunt console it just

1085
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,450
it's a little toy that makes noises

1086
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,920
we've got the Portsmouth cipher con and

1087
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,590
we've got some TTL USB to TTL adapter so

1088
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,420
you can use these to program some of the

1089
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,120
Arduino that don't have the USB header

1090
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,430
on them so when we finish the talk if

1091
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,339
you want to come up here

1092
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,930
one thing off the table or in a head

1093
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,729
you're curious about a specific thing

1094
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:09,960
just ask us we'll try and put one of

1095
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,450
those out there's one left when it's

1096
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,130
gone it's gone I'm sorry there's quite a

1097
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,089
big pile here though so hopefully

1098
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,469
there's enough to go around for people

1099
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,019
who want stuff and we've got carts here

1100
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,969
too so you can reach out to us if you

1101
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:22,380
have questions about how to build it or

1102
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,799
I said oh yeah well we'll put them on

1103
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:29,219
the site - yeah okay

1104
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:32,599
any questions about the talk
