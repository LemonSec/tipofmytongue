1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,830
cool alright can you guys hear me cool

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,670
alright so you know I'm Chris Ellis or

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,559
sometimes I'm Chris joint engine or

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,530
joint engine or Joyner or a number of

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,260
variants on that right but I'm kind of

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,449
here today to talk about genetic

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,460
algorithms so what that is it's kind of

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,890
a simple to implement machine learning

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,769
algorithm which is it's kind of fun and

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,180
kind of cool and a little easier to

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,830
understand and then I built a

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,720
proof-of-concept tool around this that

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,450
can brute force some websites right so

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,370
I'll show you guys that and let me just

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,620
cut to the chase because here's the

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,879
moment you guys are all waiting for and

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,160
I'll spoil it here it actually works and

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,190
in some situations it can work pretty

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,070
darn well so kind of what I'll talk to

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,079
today is give you guys a quick overview

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,670
of what this looks like what this tool

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,940
is then what is it genetic algorithm so

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,829
what exactly is it how can you implement

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,300
one of these things if you want to kind

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,100
of build it into some offensive tooling

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
yourself and then how does this compare

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,149
traditional methods right so why would

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,949
you use this thing over kind of a

29
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,720
statistical analysis approach or some

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,130
kind of heuristics or something like

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,830
that and then you know the scary part

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,930
for me because nothing ever goes right

33
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,610
when you do a demo but I'm going to try

34
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,979
to give you guys a demo and then just

35
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,390
real quick I'll touch on some other

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,250
machine learning applications kind of an

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,490
offensive security because why do these

38
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,450
defensive guys get to have all the fun

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,579
tinkering with that stuff right so Who

40
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,490
am I and to that I say nobody really

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,950
cares so I'll just skip that but I do

42
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,229
have to give one one-click quick

43
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,930
disclaimer so I do work for Kaiser

44
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,880
Permanente which is a health care

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,030
company back in the United States and

46
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,950
they have some lawyers and those lawyers

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,600
advised me to say that you know this is

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,939
kind of my own brainchild and that you

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,979
know any views I expressed here do not

50
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,600
necessarily represent the company but

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,869
that being said you know it's kind of

52
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,490
our first foray into releasing some

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,380
stuff to the public so if this goes well

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,850
and I don't piss too many people off

55
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,219
then you may see come some more of our

56
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,570
stuff down the road kind of in the

57
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,970
future I know some of my co-workers have

58
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,550
some cool stuff around reverse

59
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,560
engineering that it'll be exciting to

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,990
see

61
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,570
okay so let me just start off with an

62
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,030
anecdote right so I have a customer come

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,040
to me and they they basically have some

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,750
new webservice they're trying out and

65
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,480
they say okay we give every customer

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,910
some kind of URL or some kind of token

67
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,950
and it's like six or seven or eight

68
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,410
digits and anybody who presents this URL

69
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,780
token can access some kind of web

70
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,220
resource so some of their personal

71
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
information so we give this user a URL

72
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,240
any time they present this URL they can

73
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,490
see you know their information and I say

74
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,350
well do you think this is secure which

75
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,410
is kind of a loaded question right so

76
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm kind of looking at this thing and I

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
say well well the entropy is pretty good

78
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,930
right if I want to get into Chris's

79
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,400
personal information I'm not going to be

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,290
able to do that because it's long enough

81
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,300
and it's random enough if we want to get

82
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,650
into John's or Bob's personal

83
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,000
information I'm probably not going to be

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
able to do that but I'm kind of a jerk

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,910
right so I say well this customer has

86
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,580
millions of clients of their own and you

87
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,200
know so the space is saturated enough

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
maybe I can actually get into some

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,950
people's spaces right so I decided to

90
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,540
build a brute forced her to kind of see

91
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,060
how far I can take this and so I'm kind

92
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,100
of analyzing these tokens and I'm

93
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,630
looking at them and I'm saying well they

94
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,820
didn't do this right and by that I mean

95
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,620
these tokens don't look entirely random

96
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,560
they have you know more lowercase

97
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
letters than uppercase letters they have

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,810
more numbers than you know lowercase

99
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,820
letters and all these things and there

100
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,010
can be variable lengths but the variable

101
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,870
lengths certain lengths seem to pop up

102
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,209
more often and me wanting to build a

103
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,970
good brute-forcing tool so I can get a

104
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,670
good kick out of this I go through and I

105
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,930
kind of start doing some statistical

106
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,760
analysis and I start weighting my tools

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,100
so it has different guesses and I say

108
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,070
I'm too lazy to do this forget it so

109
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,420
instead I kind of implement a machine

110
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,830
learning algorithm to do it for me

111
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,480
so that's kind of GA for Sur and I named

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,280
it GA for sure because I'm original and

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,950
creative than no that's that's the best

114
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,100
name I could come up with right and just

115
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,660
kind of a sample run here you guys can

116
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,250
kind of see it and it looks kind of

117
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,410
confusing but but I'll explain it real

118
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,329
quick on the left it's kind of the first

119
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,340
run on the program and what this matrix

120
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,990
is it's got a bunch of different threads

121
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,700
running and each thread is taking a

122
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,600
different approach

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,060
forcing right and it's this one's

124
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,920
guessing you know 47% chance of a

125
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,900
lowercase character 50% chance of an

126
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
upper 2% of a digit and then kind of min

127
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,060
and max length right and it's you know

128
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,070
it's it's all over the board at first

129
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,710
and then kind of after 11 iterations you

130
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,840
can see it went from guessing 19% to

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
guessing 48% correct and you can also

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,210
see that it's kind of zeroed in on kind

133
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,590
of an optimum solution for this

134
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,310
particular problem space and those of

135
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,270
you guys were staring at this thing

136
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,130
you're going what the hell I'm seeing

137
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,780
some kind of sideways vectors here with

138
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,290
the similar weights but different scores

139
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,670
that's because this particular target I

140
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,780
just kinda wanted to throw something up

141
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,250
on the screen and this particular target

142
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,350
had like an IPS or an IDs or something

143
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,780
hypothetical target right had an IPS or

144
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,870
IDs and it was blocking me along the way

145
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,610
a little bit and I didn't didn't run

146
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,110
each thread very much I think I did like

147
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,510
15 runs so maybe not statistically

148
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,820
significant but just kind of show you an

149
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,200
example of what this thing kind of looks

150
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,700
like so maybe kind of taking a step back

151
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,350
right what actually is a genetic

152
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,400
algorithm how could you build one right

153
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,540
so just kind of by way of a quick

154
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,930
summary all's it is is it's just a tool

155
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,370
that takes a set of guesses and then

156
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,320
kind of refines them over time to you

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,920
know make better guesses and you know a

158
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,270
lot of these machine learning algorithms

159
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,740
kind of take this notion of mimicking

160
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,810
something in nature like you know your

161
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,470
brain or something like that and genetic

162
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,580
algorithms are very similar and that

163
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,810
they mimic this kind of notion of

164
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,500
evolution or kind of you know

165
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,240
progressive improvement survival of the

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,810
fittest

167
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,110
and each member of this kind of initial

168
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,610
population that we have has a chance to

169
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,500
survive and move on and then kind of mix

170
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,460
and match genes with other

171
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,250
well-performing threads and you know get

172
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,870
better as it goes and goes and goes and

173
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,790
what's really cool about this and I'll

174
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,500
talk specifically about this and it

175
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,580
actually has some really cool traits

176
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,250
when you look at password cracking is

177
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,320
the end result of this algorithm is it

178
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,780
becomes super robust so you can kind of

179
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,280
throw all sorts of curveballs at this

180
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,100
thing and it does some kind of cool

181
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,160
stuff right but so you know you start

182
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,780
with this population which if you're

183
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,430
looking at kind of a brute forcing too

184
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,560
could just be a set of threads right and

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,690
they have some goal so attacking a web

186
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,490
server and then we from there kind of

187
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,200
how do we determine what moves on to the

188
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,750
next generation and how do we mix and

189
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
match some kind of traits of these

190
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,930
positive performing brute-forcing

191
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,170
threads right and the magic kind of

192
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,900
comes down to well we fire them off we

193
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,700
look how they do and then we pass them

194
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,170
to something which is called a fitness

195
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,870
function which basically just measures

196
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,150
how well they did right and then we kind

197
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,640
of apply three fundamental you know

198
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,650
cornerstones of genetic algorithms which

199
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,440
are just roulette style selection

200
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,970
crossover and mutation and we can't go

201
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,980
in that order and what these are is

202
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,900
roulette selection each thread gets kind

203
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
of a piece of a wheel and depending on

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,710
how well it did it gets a bigger piece

205
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,330
or a smaller piece and we just spin the

206
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,220
wheel a bunch of times so think you know

207
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,070
random weighted selection and it's kind

208
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,720
of important to note here that things

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,750
that didn't do very well can still still

210
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,430
move on to the next generation things

211
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,220
that did very well may may not move on

212
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,570
sometimes things can move on you know

213
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,960
multiple times and if you kind of take

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,670
it back to this example of in nature

215
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,470
right survival the fittest this is kind

216
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,290
of analogous to some hardship or some

217
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,970
disease or starvation and the more fit

218
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,730
threads get to move on right

219
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,630
then we undergo this thing called

220
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,250
crossover and it's it's difficult to

221
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,780
explain so you guys get to look at some

222
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,410
of my lovely programmer art here but

223
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,240
basically what this is is we try to take

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,520
traits from well-performing threads and

225
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,380
mix them so we kind of pick a random

226
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,790
point in our parameter set of each

227
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,110
thread so just the weights it's guessing

228
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,600
and we just cross them over so kind of

229
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
here if you had a thread that you know

230
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
is represented by a straight line and a

231
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
thread that is represented by a squiggly

232
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,930
line and these are two kind of well

233
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,380
performing you know threads these guys

234
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,790
get matched up for crossover and then

235
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,410
you have one thread that's a straight

236
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,730
line with some squiggles and one that's

237
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,260
a squiggle line with some straight lines

238
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,190
right and you know this has an analogy

239
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,320
kind of in the the animal world too and

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,960
I'll let you guys figure that one out on

241
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,799
your own right

242
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,770
but then finally we've got mutation

243
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,900
which is pretty much exactly what it

244
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,340
sounds like so we take all these

245
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,690
well-performing threads that have kind

246
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,050
of been mixed up and matched up and we

247
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,480
and then we just kind of roll the dice

248
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,399
for each parameter the very small chance

249
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,920
and we can adjust the parameter any

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
which way we want right and we have to

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,070
keep it a small chance because if you

252
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,080
don't you you end up with a rate you

253
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,089
know kind of random search algorithm

254
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,209
which is just the brute force so you

255
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,100
know just kind of touch it up a little

256
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,170
bit this is kind of the problem space in

257
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,089
my head and you can see here you've got

258
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,800
a bunch of hills and valleys and things

259
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,570
and the way I look at this as you've got

260
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,760
some you know shorter hills which are

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
kind of good solutions or local maximums

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
and then you've got like one big hill

263
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,330
over there which is a great solution

264
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,270
right so the global maximum and that's

265
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,399
kind of where you want to end up on and

266
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,350
kind of the classical conventional

267
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,529
approach to a problem like this is you

268
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,089
kind of pick a point and you move in the

269
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,459
steepest direction nearby and as long as

270
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,890
you're improving you keep moving in that

271
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,290
direction right so you don't like the

272
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,550
hill algorithm this is kind of like

273
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,870
you're going to a target number and you

274
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,399
just kind of increment to get there kind

275
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,529
of thing but that has some problems

276
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,540
right so if you started out here in this

277
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,190
valley and you go oh there's a steep

278
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,899
slope this way I'll go here you get

279
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,649
stuck up here right and so it kind of

280
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:05,970
runs into problems when you have a space

281
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,870
like this with lots of different

282
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,800
problems lots of maximums right you can

283
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
also get screwed up if you kind of run

284
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,950
into this situation where you don't have

285
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,470
necessarily kind of a smooth graph right

286
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,209
you've got bumps and squiggles and all

287
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,270
sorts of things or breakpoints and kind

288
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,890
of you know there are conventional

289
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,089
approaches to kind of overcoming this

290
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,250
too but the way a genetic algorithm does

291
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,899
is you kind of start out with the

292
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,760
population of points right so we talked

293
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,890
about that with multiple threads it kind

294
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,200
of shifts towards correct directions and

295
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,610
then you've got this mutation thrown in

296
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,620
with a very small chance so that even if

297
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,170
you do get stuck stuck up here on this

298
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,200
little teeny dinky mountain maybe you

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,660
have a random kind of input and it pops

300
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,130
over there and all the threads just kind

301
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,180
of start evolving in that direction

302
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,560
because they see that it's performing

303
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,240
better so that's kind of some of this

304
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,399
robustness just intuitively for you

305
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,490
that's kind of cool and now you're

306
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,900
probably sick of that so let's talk

307
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,420
about how this tool actually works right

308
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,610
and it's

309
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,619
I had the creative name of genetic

310
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,850
algorithm Forrester I was calling it

311
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,699
link for sir right even more creative so

312
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,699
it's a little old screenshot but you

313
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,989
know I've kind of alluded to it already

314
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,360
but basically what it does is I

315
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,549
leveraged genetic algorithm so I kind of

316
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,519
start off with a pool of threads and

317
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,540
they all go off and try to brute force

318
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,339
something and they do it for some kind

319
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,839
of set number of iterations and it's

320
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,790
fully configurable and then you kind of

321
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,259
look at the web response which is like a

322
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,019
302 or 200 or something like that and

323
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,360
you say okay I have I have a hit here

324
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,149
right so that's a success then you kind

325
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,059
of pump to this Fitness function which

326
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,249
is just basically a way of saying how

327
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,439
well did I perform and then you go

328
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,299
through these three tenets of genetic

329
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,899
algorithm roulette selection crossover

330
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,910
and mutation your new population is

331
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,369
ready and then it fires off right and

332
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,350
the process repeats so kind of pictured

333
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,850
here is just a run and it's just going

334
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,629
through one quick generation and in this

335
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,429
particular case I was targeting one of

336
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:11,399
these URL shortening tools not

337
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,689
necessarily because it's a good example

338
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,369
but because it's it's hilarious to kind

339
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,949
of hit these things right and kind of on

340
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,199
the right I had to censor it for certain

341
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,689
reasons but was the guest as it was

342
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,879
making and then on the left here is kind

343
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,589
of the output of what it's actually

344
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,110
visiting right so it says oh I found a

345
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,119
302 that's a hit let me pipe it to the

346
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:33,869
output right and now here's where things

347
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,759
get kind of interesting you're probably

348
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,730
saying well well Chris how well does

349
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,879
something like this work in the wild is

350
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,220
this something that I could leverage and

351
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,600
even if you aren't asking that I've got

352
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,669
the answer right so it it works pretty

353
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,910
good right but before I kind of jump in

354
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,269
there's a couple of caveats so my test

355
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:58,709
target is kind of a database of

356
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,869
passwords right so I went out and I

357
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:03,949
searched for plaintext passwords and

358
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,939
basically did that until I was bored of

359
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,410
searching for plaintext passwords and

360
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,139
that number seems to be 44 million so

361
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,290
think like you know LinkedIn rock you

362
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,970
eat harmony cracks those kind of things

363
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,309
I just shoved them into a database and

364
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,049
then I kind of set up a web server and

365
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,129
you guys will see it in a second when I

366
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,590
demo this thing and basically

367
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,970
all that web server does is queries

368
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,340
database it returns a 200 response if

369
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,870
you get a hit it returns a 404 if you

370
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,470
get a miss and it's you know kind of

371
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,180
akin to password cracking in that sense

372
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,620
so you make a password guess you get a

373
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,870
hit back or kind of the example I talked

374
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,850
about earlier where some vendor or

375
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,620
something has some token in a URL and

376
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,980
you're trying to guess it and it's a

377
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,390
little limited that I don't actually

378
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,890
bother taking out entries when you get a

379
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,870
hit so that's kind of a little caveat

380
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,450
here and I only guess like six and

381
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,710
that's just because brute-forcing has a

382
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,810
lot of empty space and I'm impatient and

383
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,980
didn't want to have to run ten million

384
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,050
tries to have statistic significance

385
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,470
right but I took kind of four approaches

386
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,570
so I did kind of the raw brute force

387
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,490
right and this is somebody who doesn't

388
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,510
know what they're doing just throw

389
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,040
something up there

390
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,080
it may not be proportionately correct so

391
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,720
if I took my character set his digits

392
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,230
and letters I give 50% chance of picking

393
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,370
each one which is not necessarily

394
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,430
mathematically correct but did it

395
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,270
anyways and 10,000 guesses I had like

396
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,910
three hits right which is it's just

397
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,350
garbage nobody's gonna do that

398
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,760
so then I did it a little bit more

399
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
correct and I kind of lined up all of my

400
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,630
character sets and picks from a random

401
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,030
spot in the line which is maybe a little

402
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,950
bit more mathematically correct and I

403
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,070
get like seven hits so then I say okay

404
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,800
well let's do this the right way and I

405
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,030
take a million passwords out of my

406
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,860
database and I start looking at them and

407
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,230
I say okay these are composed of all

408
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,610
these things and they're all linked six

409
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,640
and and if anybody's curious for link

410
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,800
six passwords it's pretty much majority

411
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
lowercase and then some numbers and very

412
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,640
few upper case and I hope you know

413
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,260
nobody's using like six passwords to

414
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,970
protect anything on the internet just

415
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,020
saying but you know I I did this and I

416
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,850
got 23 hits and so now we're kind of

417
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,440
getting to the acceptable range and

418
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,970
depending on what you're doing if you're

419
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,770
kind of doing an offline attack right

420
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,240
this is it's just reasonable and I

421
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,620
didn't take it as far as I could've

422
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,580
right I could have done these things

423
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,710
where you pair up characters and you say

424
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,050
use come after cues and all that fancy

425
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,970
stuff but but like I said I'm kind of

426
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,440
lazy and I fired off my my genetic

427
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,790
algorithm brute-force turn to my great

428
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,649
surprise I had like had like 80 hits

429
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:38,740
and that kind of surprised me right and

430
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,809
until I realized what it was doing and

431
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,369
you guys will actually see in a second

432
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,899
kind of what it's doing and it's it's

433
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,369
actually kind of cool basically it

434
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,490
zeroed in on a pattern that I I guess I

435
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,350
should have seen coming but it's kind of

436
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,589
an interesting notion real quick if I

437
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,709
take off this length six restriction and

438
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,009
what does this graph look like and this

439
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,230
is just taken with a grain of salt it

440
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,309
looks something like this

441
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,119
right so now my genetic algorithm has

442
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,610
2600 hits and basically what it did was

443
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,110
it zeroed in on shorter passwords right

444
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,889
so threads with it's easier to get four

445
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:16,600
passwords it zeroed in real quick on

446
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,009
that sort of guessing shorter passwords

447
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,779
but I just kind of love this graph

448
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,079
because it's like what I mean you can't

449
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,720
even see see these first two and then

450
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,699
you know you can kind of see statistical

451
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,769
base looks like a blurred line kind of

452
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:30,939
thing and then you've got this massive

453
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:33,309
one but you know a couple couple caveats

454
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,589
I didn't do this for the other methods

455
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,329
this is just like the graph from before

456
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,040
compared and that's because it's

457
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,839
difficult to do traditional brute force

458
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,639
with variable methods it just is at

459
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,980
least in a way to make sense to me and

460
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,069
you know so figure out what shorter and

461
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:50,470
you know this is kind of the strength of

462
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,600
something like this and to kind of quote

463
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,860
a teammate who's a little bit smarter

464
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,429
than I am

465
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,309
if if they're you know there's a pattern

466
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,779
there but you're not necessarily sure

467
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,970
what to look for this is a pretty pretty

468
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,329
decent approach and so now let me give

469
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,159
you guys a quick demo and this is kind

470
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,109
of the scary thing because I don't know

471
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,390
exactly what it's going to do but I have

472
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,799
a good idea I've run this off like a

473
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,500
hundred times and 95% of the time it

474
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,869
does does what I want it to and then 5%

475
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,890
it's like oh okay

476
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,409
but but we'll see here so here's my my

477
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,689
database right and I just thrown in

478
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,010
the URL and if it's in the password or

479
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,179
it's in the password dictionary or

480
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:32,770
whatever my database full of real

481
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,600
people's passwords you get a nice two

482
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,309
hundred response not in the database Bob

483
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,080
404 because nobody's using that as a

484
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,350
password right and I'll throw that in my

485
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,820
actual password dictionary so don't use

486
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,760
that as a password now right but you

487
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,010
know back to

488
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,500
so that's it it's you know real simple

489
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,220
and here's a nice command prompt first

490
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,730
ones just my database running uh alright

491
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,530
so this is kind of the tool and you know

492
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,790
as it goes it generates these three

493
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,110
files and I'll talk about those in a

494
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,250
second but let me just go ahead and get

495
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,020
rid of those so you can see there's

496
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,540
nothing up my sleeve here Java - jar and

497
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,830
I wrote it in Java I know everybody

498
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,710
loves Python but this is like blasphemy

499
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,630
but I don't like Python so I write a lot

500
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,170
of things in Java so this is kind of

501
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,800
what the tool looks like and and I was I

502
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,390
was trying to use somebody else's tool

503
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,040
recently and found out that the

504
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
documentation was really ugly so I kind

505
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,230
of make these fancy command-line things

506
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,420
here right but you've got some options

507
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,790
which is just kind of s which is the

508
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,740
size of your generation how many threads

509
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,320
I which is how many iterations per

510
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,730
thread so what do you kind of measure

511
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:52,770
success by Wow zoom oh yeah let's see if

512
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,940
I can figure out how to do that on this

513
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:03,179
thing bigger view bigger is that zooming

514
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,410
it all ah yeah if it's something like

515
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,710
that just just scream at me right cuz I

516
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:15,360
I don't know where I am even man so okay

517
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,120
so we've got some flags here right s is

518
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,860
kind of the size of the generation so

519
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,090
how many of these threads are spinning

520
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,450
up I is you know kind of the number of

521
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,890
tries for generation you got some things

522
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,740
here min and Max length that's kind of

523
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,240
out of the spirit of genetic algorithms

524
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,650
and zero knowledge and all that stuff

525
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,630
but I mean why do you want a 50 length

526
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,100
password right so I kind of implemented

527
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,110
some stuff forced there and then you can

528
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,550
kind of see here stuff that I had to

529
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,000
implement as I went for various reasons

530
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,980
kind of related to IDs and IPS evasion

531
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,140
so you can pipe it through a proxy like

532
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,429
poor not that I know anything about that

533
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,690
you can pipe it through a list of

534
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,300
proxies give us some timeouts delays by

535
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,040
default it picks a random user agent

536
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,820
kind of thing and that's it so let's see

537
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,600
if I can run this thing

538
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,980
and let's see here I'm gonna go with

539
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,700
like fifty threads and I'll give each

540
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,650
one a hundred tries which may not be

541
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,710
great but maybe enough I'll point this

542
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,030
kind of my localhost and a little

543
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,320
character signifies where I want to

544
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,200
inject I'm using a self-signed cert so

545
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm not gonna check that I know I forgot

546
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,110
something here let's set the min to five

547
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,000
max to seven but I'm gonna go ahead and

548
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
run it and it'll yell at me if I forgot

549
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,740
something okay so now here's the moment

550
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,870
of truth right so every time he gets a

551
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,450
hit basically it spits out what its

552
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,550
guess was and what the hit was in this

553
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,320
case it's you know there is no redirect

554
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,910
or anything like that there's no page

555
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,290
tail so it just kind of spits out the

556
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,330
same thing and the second here to look

557
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,580
like it's actually getting faster it's

558
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,740
not getting faster what it's doing is

559
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,450
it's having more hits per second right

560
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,010
and so it's spitting out things faster

561
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,210
and faster and faster and faster and

562
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,120
faster and you know I'm doing 100

563
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,600
threads per yeah 100 tries per thread

564
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,920
and 50 threads it'll take a while to

565
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,040
finish but hopefully if this goes like

566
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,690
I'm expecting to in a couple of minutes

567
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,850
it'll look like it's just zooming by but

568
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,920
um in the meantime let me just kind of

569
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,990
show you the files it's generating so

570
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,750
here's kind of this database discovered

571
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,210
links sequel light right and this is

572
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,440
just kind of a cache because you don't

573
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,350
want to generate extra web requests it

574
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,970
just causes a lot of traffic and gets

575
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,210
people angry at you and it's also kind

576
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,920
of fun if you run this thing for like 48

577
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,210
hours against one of these URL

578
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,650
shortening services you can just query

579
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,340
this for like PWD equals and be amazed

580
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,720
the kind of things people kind of hide

581
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,320
in those URL shortening services which I

582
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,940
recommend only hitting with appropriate

583
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,210
permissions of course right and then

584
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,050
we've kind of got this upcoming

585
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,120
generation dot txt which is basically a

586
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,180
save file and let's see what it's got

587
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,110
there so this is kind of what it's

588
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,760
thinking and in terms of next generation

589
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,680
and again these are just kind of chances

590
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,110
of picking certain things so oddly

591
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,760
enough that you can see some blank 7s

592
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,100
here and intuitively we know link 5 is

593
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,890
better this looks like it's doing it's

594
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,780
doing all right I kind of know the

595
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,790
solution that's gonna wind up on

596
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,560
sometimes takes longer to get there so

597
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm

598
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,960
quick so it's a little bit of a grab bag

599
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
but it does look like it's certain to

600
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,980
zero in on some things so here's three

601
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,930
that have similar weights and you know

602
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,060
this will change periodically and now

603
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,500
before I show you the scores let's just

604
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,640
see if it's actually picking up some

605
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,220
speed here okay so now it's going it's

606
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,990
not getting real fast yet but it's

607
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,040
getting there right so this is a lot

608
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,960
faster than the one per second kind of

609
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,020
that we started seeing so then the last

610
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,840
file here that it generated is kind of

611
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,360
score tracking and that's exactly what

612
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,830
it sounds like right so I'll show you if

613
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,070
that is so okay so it's a 3% with the

614
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,500
kind of a maximum here of 10% the best

615
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,150
threads 10% right now which is which is

616
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,430
still garbage so we didn't get the best

617
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,670
start in the world but I promise you

618
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,460
it'll get really good but here's what's

619
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,780
interesting right so here's where it

620
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,310
started off with the raw brute force

621
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,810
approach and it was scoring less than 1%

622
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,660
right so I mean we're talking pretty

623
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,120
significant improvements and the

624
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,650
best-performing thread because I can't

625
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,500
see it kind of this angle is 2% so we've

626
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,020
gone from a 2% hit rate and what like a

627
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,000
minute of me kind of droning on we went

628
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,520
from a 2% hit rate to uh I don't know

629
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,170
10% hit rate it might be even a little

630
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,710
higher now I can run it again yeah now

631
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,600
we're at 12% right so it's kind of like

632
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,040
it's shooting off in the right direction

633
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,310
which is kind of cool and you can see

634
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,680
here it likes lowercase letters and then

635
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,320
it likes it actually likes digits the

636
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,080
most it zeroing in on this kind of link

637
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,460
5s and lower and oddly enough this is

638
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,500
not what the statistical analysis showed

639
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,600
right you're thinking well if you kind

640
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,950
of take these million passwords you get

641
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,380
this thing that says statistically

642
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,000
lowercase characters should be guessed

643
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,570
more often right which is is weird right

644
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,380
and if you look at it here now it's

645
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,820
going pretty quick and it's got cached

646
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,890
hits and all that stuff right I'll just

647
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,540
terminate this out and let it keep

648
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,060
running but here's where we kind of

649
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,520
start getting to the the really kind of

650
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,710
cool part of this problem and why it's

651
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,750
effective in these things and that's

652
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,010
kind of what it's thinking and what's

653
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,600
going on here and why the hell is it

654
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,940
having such a high hit rate and if you

655
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,320
guys couldn't kind of tell I know the

656
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,750
screen is small you know

657
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,490
kind of what returns the most hits is

658
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,870
the direction it moves into it's just

659
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,030
you know intuitive and all that and it's

660
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,190
figuring out the numbers have you know

661
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,260
high return rate and shorter strings

662
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,790
work better right which makes sense so

663
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,020
if you were a person and you were trying

664
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,000
to attack something like this you know

665
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,170
one of the first things you would do is

666
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,940
you'd probably run a password dictionary

667
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,400
and then you'd run a bunch of numbers

668
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,030
right so that's kind of interesting then

669
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,230
again you know this target is not a

670
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,230
perfect simulation for example I'm not

671
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,730
pulling things out as I go so there's

672
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,110
cached hits and all that stuff

673
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,060
something kind of worth noting is it

674
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,770
doesn't land on a pure solution very

675
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,240
often or maybe if it does it takes a

676
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,810
very long time and even though it kind

677
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,910
of zeroes in on going for numbers it

678
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,900
still makes guesses with letters and I

679
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,920
argue that's a really good thing and

680
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,180
password cracking and this is where it

681
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,790
gets really cool is that if I was doing

682
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,950
this against you know passwords and I'm

683
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,180
cracking them and pulling them out as I

684
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,310
go you kind of have this trait that when

685
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,790
it starts exhausting the numbers they

686
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,050
those threads start performing poorly

687
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,670
and the threads that are guessing more

688
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,620
letters start performing better right

689
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,600
this thing will start pivoting so it'll

690
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,210
start guessing numbers and then when

691
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,830
numbers start performing poorly it

692
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,660
starts getting letters and then after

693
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,060
letters who knows it might have some

694
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,900
kind of mix of the two right and you

695
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,280
know it is based on survival of fittest

696
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,570
but there are some low scoring

697
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,880
populations that can kind of exist so

698
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,440
it's still you know kind of ties back to

699
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,700
no pure solutions in that it can still

700
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,100
guess you know poor solutions

701
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,830
periodically and kind of land wherever

702
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,160
the heck it wants to right and then

703
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,450
we've got mutation I don't know if we

704
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,430
saw any in there I just kind of glanced

705
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,260
at it the mutation kind of keeps it from

706
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,970
getting stuck at a certain point so if

707
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,310
it goes off in the wrong direction

708
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,930
periodically it'll make guesses off in

709
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,720
all sorts of random areas and sometimes

710
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,290
they do pretty well right and you know

711
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,030
this example was something I built very

712
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,460
specific to a very specific target and

713
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,720
just kind of happen to work for a lot of

714
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,420
things but my character sets are further

715
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,470
than with it right you guys are probably

716
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,650
wondering about things like you know

717
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,960
special characters stuff like that I

718
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,450
didn't include them just because for my

719
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,340
my initial build or whatever I didn't

720
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:44,670
need

721
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,220
didn't want to or whatever but you guys

722
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,230
can you guys can build this with any

723
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,610
kind of character set you want if you

724
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,430
want to take this kind of approach okay

725
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,960
so let's let's take a quick look at this

726
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,700
now right and now you guys have seen it

727
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,140
run you know what all the caveats are

728
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,490
and I'll be blunt

729
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,720
this is not oh it's the correct approach

730
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,330
right this is not kind of a silver

731
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,060
bullet that fits everything it has some

732
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,020
weaknesses right

733
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,490
it needs a saturated target space

734
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,780
because you don't know how well each

735
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,700
thread is doing or how well each member

736
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,190
of a population does unless you kind of

737
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,530
have some way of measuring it right and

738
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,230
if you're just hitting empty space

739
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,960
that's that's not so good right then

740
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,720
you've also got this kind of notion of

741
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,880
password dictionaries right if you're

742
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,650
doing an offline attack I'm probably

743
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,750
gonna use a password dictionary 99% of

744
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,700
the time first and then if I've got the

745
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,310
hardware for it which I may have right

746
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,740
I'm going to just brute-force through

747
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,620
everything like length 5 or lower so

748
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,450
this may not be the good thing but maybe

749
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,110
for an online solution or kind of if you

750
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,610
don't have all the pieces this might be

751
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,860
a good fit and oddly enough it can come

752
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,450
up with novel solutions right so

753
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,310
guessing numbers is not something that a

754
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,880
statistical approach would ever ever do

755
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,050
and so just statistic methods versus

756
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,300
kind of machine learning is a popular

757
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,060
debate right and there's there's people

758
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,680
a lot smarter than me that know a lot

759
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
more about everything here then I do and

760
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,880
they've been arguing this for a very

761
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,730
long time right but the way I kind of

762
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,370
see it is the bottom line is there's

763
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,320
advantages both ways right so you can

764
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,320
argue it til the cows come home and I

765
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,850
say that you know kind of if you don't

766
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,100
have the pieces and you know there might

767
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,830
be some kind of pattern or maybe you

768
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,240
have kind of some vendor that's doing

769
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,040
with what the one I was working with was

770
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,300
where they generate these tokens that

771
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,020
are clearly designed a little bit wrong

772
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,550
this may be a good approach right this

773
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,700
is kind of something fun if you do have

774
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,070
all the pieces you know the tried and

775
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,770
true maybe the best way to go and that's

776
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,400
just kind of how it boils down but you

777
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,750
know even when it doesn't work something

778
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,190
like this is pretty fun to just kind of

779
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,620
fire off but you know a URL shortening

780
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,970
service and kind of just see what it

781
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,840
comes up with right

782
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,320
so I'm just going to talk about it

783
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,020
briefly and most of that's because I

784
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,720
can't go to and depth on to it but we'll

785
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,100
talk just real quick another machine

786
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,510
learning approach and offensive security

787
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,610
and this is nothing new people have been

788
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,110
doing this one for a while actually

789
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,809
and what I did was I kind of you know

790
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,260
there's some existing software it was

791
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,910
put together by a guy

792
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,740
Andres Karp a thief to give credit where

793
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,360
credit is due right and he basically

794
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,100
said I can use a neural network to

795
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,070
create characters and you wrote a pair

796
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,990
hey paper on it basically a neural

797
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,100
network is this kind of thing that's

798
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,600
designed to imitate your brain and the

799
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,970
neurons and how they work and you feed

800
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,920
data into an input layer it has some

801
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,300
processing layers and spits out an

802
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,190
output right but it can have this kind

803
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,780
of cool property and that you can train

804
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,880
it on some data sets and it will spit

805
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,309
out you know similar kind of data sets

806
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,280
and so in his paper he kind of talked

807
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,380
about how he could use it to feed a

808
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,090
bunch of Shakespeare and print out

809
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,130
Shakespeare or feed a bunch of music and

810
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,190
spit out similar music and you know I

811
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,840
see all these beautiful kind of artistic

812
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,910
uses for this thing and I say boy I

813
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,950
better cram that thing full of passwords

814
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,020
right so I did and other people have

815
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,929
probably done this too right but in this

816
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:15,460
case I just took a harmony cracked

817
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,809
password which you know are all

818
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:18,250
uppercase just kind of by the nature of

819
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,070
the hash I think and that's how I guess

820
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,740
them and fed it through a bunch of times

821
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,360
and then these are all kind of things

822
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,790
that the Machine generated right and you

823
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,770
can go out get the software downloaded

824
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,960
tinker with it and you can see some of

825
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,059
these are actually like you know they

826
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,550
look like real passwords so rocky baby

827
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,510
zero zero that's nobody's password right

828
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,790
some of these are less real passwords

829
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,270
like land arena I you can kind of see

830
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,380
where it was going with it but it's

831
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,710
maybe doesn't make so much sense or I

832
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,920
love mini montt I don't know what that

833
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,309
means right there's some kind of funny

834
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:58,900
stuff there I actually had to censor

835
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,059
this because I didn't expect it to do it

836
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,260
but it spat out a lot of bad language

837
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,100
right

838
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,100
I guess people use those as passwords

839
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,440
for some reason but you know you can

840
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,850
kind of see where this application goes

841
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,750
so dictionary creation

842
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,190
you take a million good dictionaries you

843
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,870
feed them into this thing you can spit

844
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,000
out kind of you know other good

845
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,120
dictionaries hopefully there's also

846
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,309
dictionary expansion so the other day I

847
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,860
get into a database and I get twelve

848
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,809
thousand unique clear text passwords

849
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,640
right and that that turns out to be a

850
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,440
great dictionary for me so I can feed it

851
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,299
through a tool like this and I can turn

852
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,980
it from twelve thousand unique passwords

853
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,710
to twenty five thousand or however many

854
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,860
I need right and you know full

855
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,179
disclosure I've actually used this

856
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:49,179
before a couple of times and sometimes

857
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,010
it's good most of the time it's not it's

858
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,590
kind of a niche situation right the

859
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,970
thing I have used it for is after you've

860
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,320
kind of done all your cracking and

861
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,460
you've gone through all the password

862
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,690
rules and all that you're starting to

863
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,760
hit this bare bones and there's like you

864
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,289
know some small percentage of hashes

865
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,570
left you can kind of take the hashes

866
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,010
that were successfully cracked pipe them

867
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,970
through this thing and maybe get a

868
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,830
couple other hashes to kind of jumpstart

869
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,659
yourself again right so that's that's

870
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:12,220
kind of where this has uses but it

871
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,830
I think it's darn cool so it made it

872
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,419
into a slide right oh I just realized

873
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:22,059
I'm talking ridiculously fast but that's

874
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,909
okay right so we're next with something

875
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,690
like this well the thing that I kind of

876
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,429
mentioned right is you can change

877
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:32,740
character sets so there's no reason that

878
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,179
this to us to be limited to kind of the

879
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:36,070
character sets that I built then you

880
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,900
could take it to a very very granular

881
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,480
level where you do individual characters

882
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,150
you could look at pairings so you know H

883
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,390
comes after T a lot U comes after Q and

884
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,330
all sorts of things um it's already

885
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,100
written in Java so I'll probably build

886
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,840
it into a burp suite plug-in so I'm some

887
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,820
point in time right I use it once in a

888
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,549
while I use burp suite every day it'd be

889
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,870
kind of cool if those two things work

890
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,710
together and it's it's not a huge jump

891
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,970
for me to integrate it into something

892
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,640
like that it's just a question of me

893
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,370
being really lazy right my perpetual

894
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,220
downfall and then kind of you know I

895
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,270
kinda want to take this to the next

896
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,860
level so you don't you don't see genetic

897
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,440
algorithms kind of working by themselves

898
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,880
you know terribly often they're often

899
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,610
paired with kind of other algorithms so

900
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,919
it would be kind of cool if if I did

901
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,810
that and gave it access to not just

902
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,910
character sets but you know dictionaries

903
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,370
and rule sets and hash cat and kind of

904
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,100
just had this hash cracking automated

905
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,040
from start to finish for me right or I

906
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,290
think that'd be cool

907
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,460
and so let me let me get to the bottom

908
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,620
line right and here's kind of my closing

909
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,450
thoughts and that is it works and in

910
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,750
some cases it can actually work

911
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,840
surprisingly well right it's even when

912
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,010
it doesn't work it's kind of fun to

913
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,590
watch this thing go off and do some some

914
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,710
kind of oddities and if anybody cares

915
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,200
all my source codes up there on github I

916
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,300
kind of threw it up there I also threw

917
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,490
some kind of data exfiltration tool up

918
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,610
if anybody is interested in that and you

919
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,050
know the big thing that I want you guys

920
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,239
to take away is that machine learning

921
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,840
has offensive applications right so you

922
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,920
know hopefully somebody will go out

923
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,989
there and build build the next Skynet

924
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,360
that I can leverage and that'd be kind

925
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,139
of useful right so that's like I said I

926
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,639
apologize I got got a little nervous

927
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:33,850
talked a little fast so questions go for

928
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:41,260
it my application is not not so much for

929
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,540
hash cracking it's for online type

930
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,969
attacks right but if you wanted to apply

931
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,100
something like this to hash cracking you

932
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,210
would be able to implement it for

933
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,530
whatever one you wanted right

934
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,600
or you could you could let some other

935
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,159
some other tool implement the hash

936
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,469
algorithms for you like hash ket and you

937
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,330
could code your parameter set which is

938
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,680
basically what the genetic algorithm is

939
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,310
guessing as inputs to the the tool hash

940
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,270
cat or something like that

941
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,750
[Music]

942
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,880
well yeah so I mean the the cool thing

943
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,980
about this is you don't program rules it

944
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,600
kind of comes up with them itself but

945
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,870
you can actually kind of you can put

946
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,490
that behavior into it if you want to

947
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,070
using a proxy right so kind of back here

948
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,780
on the tool that supports proxying and

949
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,760
things like that it also has this save

950
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,700
file which is upcoming generations and

951
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,860
you can modify that however you want so

952
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,390
you can kind of set it with things that

953
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,900
you you know to be true ahead of time

954
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,580
but one of the advantages of something

955
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,410
like this is that it can explore

956
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,630
possibilities that you you may not

957
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,580
explore yourself right so giving it

958
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,310
maybe a broad base and then kind of

959
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,020
letting it kind of shift and pick us own

960
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,970
direction maybe the advantage of

961
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,440
something like this but you could do

962
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,590
that

963
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,160
it's Java and I didn't use any of these

964
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,260
fancy OS specific stuff so it should

965
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,120
probably work on everything I think I've

966
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,630
used it on Windows and Mac obviously Mac

967
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,000
but it should just be fire and go job a

968
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,280
one point seven probably I don't use one

969
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:44,640
point eight much okay so I mean I

970
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,550
haven't in this particular case

971
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,440
tried that for door busting that's kind

972
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,150
of an interesting idea I think that if I

973
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,560
were to do something like that I'd want

974
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,420
more granular character sets right I'd

975
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,100
wanted to know individual letters and

976
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,570
likelihood and I'd wanted to look at

977
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,240
previous letters and things like that

978
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,570
and the reason I do that is just because

979
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,130
right now it's designed to brute force

980
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,070
things like passwords and for those my

981
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,660
primary concern is what character said

982
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,790
I'm going to choose from right but

983
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,440
that's kind of interesting interesting

984
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,970
application and I'd be curious to see

985
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,870
how that that would work

986
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,590
if you have kind of unlimited resources

987
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,910
you know you're busting with a massive

988
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:46,630
file file list is probably fine too yeah

989
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,390
so it depends on what I'm doing a lot of

990
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,220
the time I just kind of run it until I

991
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,960
see something that's around 2% that I

992
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,480
like and then I take it and just you

993
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,950
know duplicate that in burp suite or

994
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,420
something like that and just fire it off

995
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,850
right because there's a certain point

996
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,670
where it's just good enough but you know

997
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,530
once again you could do it the other way

998
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,670
too and just leave it running overnight

999
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,490
and sometimes it'll kind of deviate so

1000
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,100
it kind of does this right in terms of

1001
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,020
how good its solution is sometimes it's

1002
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,260
better sometimes a little worse so I

1003
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:25,270
don't know yeah yeah okay so that's

1004
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,120
that's a good question and the short

1005
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,470
answer is I don't know enough about

1006
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,100
Markov chains to to give you a

1007
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,940
appropriate answer I know that they're

1008
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,090
implemented in hash cat and they're

1009
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,970
decent I probably should have done that

1010
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,330
on the little graph but I did not so

1011
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,540
sorry about that

1012
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:56,690
yeah yeah so this is these the graph

1013
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,420
back here yeah this is against my target

1014
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,120
which is 44 million real-world passwords

1015
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,070
and probably a language dictionary

1016
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,310
thrown in there and then again the

1017
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,500
caveats here and I did 10,000 runs per

1018
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,910
thing 10,000 for my my my algorithm I

1019
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,560
did pretty much for this gentleman said

1020
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,570
where I ran it a couple times picked a

1021
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,930
good thread and then did that right but

1022
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,520
yeah this is 10,000 runs length 6

1023
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,120
against 44 million passwords yeah all

1024
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,279
right well thank you guys
