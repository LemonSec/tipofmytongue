1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,550
I'm Chris Sumner some of you know me as

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,990
siggy some of you don't know me at all

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,890
hello the talk is about psychographic

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,210
targeting that's using sort of

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,170
psychology behavioral markers in

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,500
political campaigns and the talk I gave

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,840
at DEFCON was called Rage Against

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,960
weaponized AAA AI propaganda machine I

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,240
talked about why I chose that title in a

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,580
few minutes so I'm representing a small

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,570
organization called the online privacy

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,399
foundation we're a group of volunteers

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,630
and we do research into psychology

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,780
behavior and generally in online context

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,030
but as it also influences online

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,670
contexts so in 2016 in the UK which is

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,270
where I'm from we had this thing which

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,620
you may know more commonly as brexit and

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,410
I was kind of wondering why there were

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,750
these differences in people or apparent

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,550
differences in people and my wife said

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,349
well rather than bitching about it why

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,090
don't you do something about it I was

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,500
like oh that's interesting I'd love to

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,260
study this a little bit more so we did a

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,010
large research project looking at

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,060
personality numeracy thinking styles and

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,530
susceptibility to cognitive biases with

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,450
over 11,000 people across like five

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,520
months of different studies so we're

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,409
currently working for the university in

32
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,229
the u.s. to finish writing that up one

33
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,299
of the questions that we put in that

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,390
research was this one if you've got

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,009
nothing to hide you've got nothing to

36
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,619
fear and we wanted to see how the people

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,860
who voted for brexit and voted to remain

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,439
in EU how they differed and here what we

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,960
can see is kind of across the sexes and

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,270
the age groups we have a difference in

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,070
the people that agree with that

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,659
statement

43
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,909
we see that people who voted to leave

44
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,369
were much more likely to agree with that

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,079
if you've got nothing to hide you've got

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,079
nothing to fear argument so what we were

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,780
gonna do we were going to do a talk or

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,250
we were going to submit a talk to DEFCON

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,580
that was really looking at okay

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,050
authoritarianism nothing to hide what

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,800
does this mean for

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,320
privacy but then in around January saw

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,850
this article which is where it got the

54
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,910
title from the talk from the rise of the

55
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,280
weaponized a i propagate the machine

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,360
which was suggesting that companies like

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,110
cambridge analytic and you know there

58
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,550
was another company a Canadian company

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,720
actually I think aggregate IQ they go

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,150
had used like behavioral targeting micro

61
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,070
targeting on Facebook to reach different

62
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,050
audiences and kind of swayed them to

63
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,260
vote one way or the other so when that

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,960
article came out I had a few friends

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,080
contact me and say why is this legit you

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,790
know can can it happen as it were

67
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,830
because I've done some research into

68
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,530
that sort of caper before and then there

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,480
was this article came out as well which

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,160
was like does it hold water so as more

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,770
people beginning say yeah is this just

72
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,800
like you know bitching by the left or

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,320
does it actually work so previously

74
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,790
we've done some research that's looked

75
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,610
at susceptibility to social BOTS on

76
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,320
Twitter that's back in 2013 where we

77
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,850
looked at who we could target on Twitter

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,320
and whether they'd respond and how to

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
how to target them more effectively get

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,840
a bigger bang for your buck essentially

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,300
2011 and 2012 we looked at personality

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,209
in relation to Facebook usage and in

83
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,450
2001 2012 we looked at the same kind of

84
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,660
study but on Twitter and we looked at

85
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,450
dark triad traits with psych psychopathy

86
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,820
narcissism and stuff like that looking

87
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,220
at the language people use and their

88
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,320
behavior on social media so we've got a

89
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,730
little bit of background in this and

90
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,600
this was kind of this studying now has

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,420
kind of like the phase two after the the

92
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,160
brexit paper so in order to answer the

93
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,830
question of does it hold water we wanted

94
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,840
to take a kind of a different context

95
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,290
but explore that so we used or this this

96
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,390
could be the sort of more academic title

97
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,000
if you like using attitudes to online

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
surveillance to explore the efficacy of

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
psychographic marketing and political

100
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,540
campaigns the non academic term is does

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,660
this [ __ ] work

102
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,580
so we broke the study down into five

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,480
different

104
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,130
distinct studies the first one is like

105
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,920
why are people so divided the second is

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,810
well if they are divided kind of what

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,270
influences people otherwise the division

108
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,520
to be rather static and they're not so

109
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,950
something's influencing people one way

110
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,830
or the other what what is that and then

111
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,810
we look at you know what it what is the

112
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,430
effectiveness of actually trying to

113
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,900
target these different groups

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,260
individually how effective is that going

115
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,500
to be and then if you can target them

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,440
how can you persuade them you know if

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
you like to adopt one position

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,220
politically or a different position

119
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,620
politically and then finally we look at

120
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,510
well okay if this stuff gets out there

121
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,610
and people are reading it how difficult

122
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,030
is it to debunk if you like propaganda

123
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,100
so for the first one why are people so

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,610
divided well you know we looked at on my

125
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,170
attitudes to our mind surveillance but

126
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,910
we could have chosen the death penalty

127
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,770
we could have chosen same-sex marriage

128
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,170
or relationships even we could have

129
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,150
chosen migration this was opposed to

130
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,430
that the one of the leave campaigns used

131
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,980
in the in the EU referendum the brexit

132
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,910
referendum and what it is essentially is

133
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,020
that people are influenced by this trait

134
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,350
hair cord or this disposition rather

135
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,710
chordal Thorat Arianism however if

136
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,410
you're looking at the news you might be

137
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,570
forgiven for thinking that you know kind

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,730
of society split into two distinct

139
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,410
groups you know snowflakes and

140
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,190
deplorable z'

141
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,750
and there's nothing in the middle

142
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,910
whereas actually it's a lot different to

143
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,730
that and we see it kind of skewed where

144
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,340
we've got more people towards a lower

145
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,700
end of authoritarianism and it's kind of

146
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,850
this this kind of non normal

147
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,430
distribution if you like so let me

148
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,870
explain just a little bit about what

149
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,050
authoritarianism is and also say that

150
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,430
researchers have been trying to look for

151
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,600
different ways of describing

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,730
authoritarianism because the term alone

153
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,580
can cause some frustrations so people

154
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,890
who are higher in authoritarianism tend

155
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,610
to see the world in like black and white

156
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,350
you know tend to it's not always and

157
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,620
people on the

158
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,050
low-end of authoritarianism up to the

159
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,080
lower-end see in shades of gray so more

160
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,900
ambiguity if you like people hiring

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,180
authoritarianism tend to value tradition

162
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,260
more versus people who were lower in

163
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,530
authoritarianism who are more into

164
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,910
embracing new ideas new coaches and

165
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,190
thought lease was kind of a neat film

166
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,730
once still it's people hiring

167
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,560
authoritarianism tend to be less

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,900
accepting of people that outside their

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,850
groups so versus people who are lower in

170
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,700
authoritarianism who are much more

171
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,820
accepting of different groups different

172
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,910
cultures and what-have-you

173
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,530
so one of the ways of looking at all

174
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,030
Thorat areas and one of the more

175
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,790
commonly ways of looking for this is a

176
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,500
barrage of questions actually it's only

177
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,020
four so I'm not really barrage by these

178
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,169
guys film Feldman Estella in 97 they

179
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,200
came up with essentially four questions

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,350
that help measure authoritarianism and

181
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,720
they're essentially these questions so

182
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,240
what's most important for a child to

183
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,040
have self-reliance versus obedience

184
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,229
curiosity good manners independence

185
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,690
respect for elders if you answer more

186
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,430
questions on the right-hand side you

187
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,930
tend to be higher in authoritarianism

188
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,780
versus the the questions that alight

189
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,090
self-reliance curiosity independence so

190
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,410
you select one or the other it's binary

191
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,200
it's not scale so that gives you

192
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,180
actually a pretty reliable method of

193
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,490
looking at or Thorat airinas and without

194
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,860
asking too many questions

195
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,669
so we use that throughout these studies

196
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,229
so breaking down our research what we

197
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:22,660
did here is I just present quickly sort

198
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,490
with the study and the and the results

199
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,419
we had we actually ran four studies

200
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,580
looking at these attitudes to online

201
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,349
surveillance and you'll see that they're

202
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,120
like a1 and a2 and b1 and b2 there's a

203
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,530
slight difference between them in that

204
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,860
and b1 we added some numerical questions

205
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,680
over B b1 and b2 we added some numerical

206
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,170
questions and that a studies were were

207
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,730
purely questions and texts about

208
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,170
people's opinions

209
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,760
the questions we asked we asked five

210
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,980
questions the first one was you have

211
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,269
nothing to hide if you have enough

212
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,070
interfere and people had to agree or

213
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,510
disagree there was nothing in the middle

214
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,339
it was purely binary because we

215
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,320
replicated some previous research in

216
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,660
this area so we wanted to be able to see

217
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,550
whether we were able to see the same

218
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,800
results that the prior scholars had

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,810
found namely Mark Addington and

220
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,190
Elizabeth Hsu how if people are

221
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,899
interested there's plenty of notes in

222
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,600
here by the way the next question we

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,269
asked is it is acceptable that law

224
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,160
enforcement agencies have the right to

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,930
access the content of their citizens

226
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,149
online communications without a warrant

227
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,829
in order to investigate terrorism the

228
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,139
third question was it's acceptable that

229
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,420
immigrants and visitors from potentially

230
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,829
dangerous countries should have to

231
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,930
reveal their social media accounts to UK

232
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,639
border agents I should say that the

233
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,440
study was given to the UK but you can

234
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,360
try this in Canada as well be

235
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,649
interesting

236
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,110
this one you might think you know I'm

237
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,769
not but we actually took this from a

238
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:54,500
CIGI if sauce global survey on Internet

239
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,510
Security and Trust and simply the

240
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,399
question was the darknet should be shut

241
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,260
down agree or disagree I'm not quite

242
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,019
sure I only do that but I do actually

243
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,589
help some thoughts but then the final

244
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,060
question we asked was companies should

245
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,680
not be allowed to develop technologies

246
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,300
that prevent law enforcement from

247
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,029
accessing your online conversations so

248
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,440
that came from that same hip sauce

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,880
global survey so again these are the

250
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,529
surveys we ran the rough number of

251
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,370
people we had but one thing happened in

252
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,750
March of this year is that we had a if

253
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,940
you like the first terrorist attack of

254
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,600
the year in in London occurred then so

255
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
we had to look at the way that affected

256
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,670
the results of the study and that's why

257
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,440
we're kind of breaking them up into four

258
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,579
separate studies so what we look at is

259
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,769
comparing like-for-like that a one and a

260
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,990
two studies pre-imposed we see that yeah

261
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,089
there was a significant but our weekly

262
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,040
significant difference in the question

263
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,620
on if you like banning anti surveillance

264
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,630
technology the last question but

265
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,550
everything else was roughly the same I

266
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,050
draw your attention notice shutting down

267
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,100
the darknet that's got quite a bit

268
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,170
but lots of things on two surveys b1 and

269
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,720
b2 what we found is there were no real

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,330
differences actually between post and

271
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,890
pre terrorists at you know attacks so we

272
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,240
were able to do some grouping of the

273
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,800
questions based on those on those

274
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
differences so essentially for the

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
nothing to hide nothing to fear argument

276
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,550
what we see here is people who agree

277
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,560
with that statement are much higher in

278
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,160
authoritarianism both pre attack post

279
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,690
attack and you can kind of see that

280
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,260
those are you know results there in fact

281
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,120
if we look at all of the questions then

282
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,460
we see the same thing across wiretapping

283
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,370
shut down the darknet extreme vetting

284
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,250
and you know that's like revealing your

285
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,920
social media passwords border agents and

286
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,540
then banning an anti surveillance

287
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,000
technology so there's clear differences

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,140
and I can assure you that there's also

289
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,640
clear differences between the different

290
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,030
age groups as well so that's the first

291
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,770
thing we see that people have got you

292
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,280
know clear differences in opinions to

293
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,200
their attitudes to online surveillance

294
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,730
and it's drawn around this or both

295
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,490
authoritarian divide which has been

296
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,610
written about a lot so if we know that

297
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,380
those differences are there in people

298
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,080
what can influence their their views

299
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,810
well there's been some research in you

300
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,420
know in this area already and what we

301
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,730
can see is that essentially the

302
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,970
probability of support for surveillance

303
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,480
generally if you're low in

304
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,190
authoritarianism it's fairly unlikely

305
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,900
that you're going to support it and if

306
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,300
you're high in authoritarianism you

307
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,650
probably are going to support and go

308
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,320
yeah it probably needs to be done and

309
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,420
that's kind of your baseline so there's

310
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,680
two arguments one suggests here that as

311
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,140
the threat increases or the perception

312
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,150
of the threat increases people who are

313
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,850
higher in authoritarianism will increase

314
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,130
their support for those kinds of

315
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,260
policies you know supporting support for

316
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,230
surveillance the other theory is that

317
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,090
actually it's kind of the reverse of

318
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,550
that the support increases among people

319
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,100
who were lower in authoritarianism and

320
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,140
that's been found by headington and sue

321
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,080
hay in a paper in 2000

322
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,589
an 11 there's a another piece of

323
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,870
research which also came out in 2011

324
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,839
which suggested that both of those

325
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,700
papers or theories who have were somehow

326
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,070
you know correct or partially right and

327
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,100
that it's anger and anxiety that are the

328
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,050
motivating factors so people higher in

329
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,779
authoritarianism anger is gonna motivate

330
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,480
them so if you piss them off about

331
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,529
terrorism surveillance what-have-you

332
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,540
their support for it is going to go up

333
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,240
and the fear element in people who were

334
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
alone north or attained and some is

335
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,080
going to have a kind of a higher effect

336
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,820
so that's kind of the the theory and

337
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,510
where that's going at the moment so for

338
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,610
for what we did in this second study

339
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,740
essentially we replicated the work there

340
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,830
headington and sue had done in 2011 and

341
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,170
that question was essentially you added

342
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,820
a question into the surveys which was

343
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,490
how worried are you that person how you

344
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,680
personally might become a victim of a

345
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,620
terrorist attack and you essentially had

346
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,980
like you know I've from not worried at

347
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,470
all to very word which we just labeled

348
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,459
here as low medium high and very high so

349
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,029
what we did essentially you do exactly

350
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,740
what Haddington did which was used and

351
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,200
logistically to use a statistical term

352
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
and we've got authoritarianism coded

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,550
along the bottom and the probability on

354
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,579
there on the top so this is what

355
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,950
Haddington found it's just a picture of

356
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,880
the book here they found that as other

357
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
as people know in authoritarianism if

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,560
they were concerned about being a victim

359
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,160
of a terrorist attack their support for

360
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
wiretapping in this case rose from like

361
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,770
25 percent of probability of supporting

362
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,529
it to a 75 percent ish probability but

363
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,880
there wasn't that much difference in

364
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,940
those people who were high so what we

365
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,480
found was sort of similar actually

366
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,589
people who were worried about their

367
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,440
support increased quite dramatically

368
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,779
whereas people who people who were high

369
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,640
in authoritarianism or higher in or

370
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,730
Thera tones and that the probability of

371
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,300
support didn't change as much

372
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,330
and we saw that fairly repeatedly across

373
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,220
each of the different studies with the

374
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,370
exception of extreme extreme vetting not

375
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,930
quite sure what's going on in the

376
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,780
extreme vetting graph but I draw your

377
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,400
attention to the shutdown the darknet

378
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,040
one where there was a lot of support to

379
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,900
begin with and if people were worried

380
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,940
about the threat of terrorism were being

381
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,680
involved in it then their support went

382
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
off and I guess that's because they're

383
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,920
not really familiar with exactly what

384
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,410
the sort of Darkness is and you know who

385
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,770
is so that's kind of worrying because

386
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,120
governments could look at that and say

387
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,380
well there's already a lot of support

388
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,180
for that you know we can double down on

389
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,800
that strategy and it would be a vote

390
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,310
winner

391
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,170
so what's influencing these people it's

392
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,330
not just a anger and anxiety but those

393
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,820
are at least likely candidates for

394
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,620
exploring in a little bit more depth so

395
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,440
the third study was okay well we know

396
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,630
what how people differ and however maybe

397
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,250
we can nudge them one way or the other

398
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,690
possibly using anger and anxiety but how

399
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,850
effective is in actually how effective

400
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,590
are we actually targeting these

401
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,080
different groups so it's been like loads

402
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,140
of research into looking at the

403
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,090
relationship between Facebook Twitter

404
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,250
activity and whatnot on personality so

405
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,570
you know you've got your age sex

406
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,280
geography Facebook interests and

407
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,600
outcomes you know your personality

408
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,940
traits what we essentially want to do is

409
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,710
do that the other way around so pipe the

410
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,200
personality variable in and get like

411
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,450
these are the different add markets we

412
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,020
want to target on on Facebook so

413
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,599
essentially low authoritarianism high

414
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
all Thorat Arianism we want to take

415
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,170
those characteristics pop them through a

416
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,810
function and go well local authority on

417
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,520
isms are made up of these these age

418
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,099
groups sexes places where they live and

419
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,369
their Facebook interests so the way we

420
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,859
approach this study essentially we

421
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,540
looked at each of those four four

422
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,420
variables so four for age and sex we

423
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,700
looked at the results from our EU

424
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,060
referendum paper and essentially they're

425
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,050
for females here in the 18 to 35

426
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,810
category there were very very few that

427
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,650
voted for leave so

428
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,110
influenced how we were going to target

429
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,360
the different groups whereas for males

430
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,190
there were clear differences and for

431
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,260
female older females there were you know

432
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,940
kind of clear differences between leave

433
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,520
and remain alone well Thorat arianism so

434
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,490
for our Facebook target categories we

435
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,590
essentially have the level authoritarian

436
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,150
in group we're going to just go for

437
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,040
males of any age group and females under

438
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,580
35 might be a safe bet and for high

439
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,410
authority Arianism males again of any

440
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,580
age because there's nothing much to

441
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,090
divide them and females over a 35 and

442
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,920
over might be a safe bet so that's one

443
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,160
target group the next is what we want to

444
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,570
do is look at geography and there's BIM

445
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,570
papers this is by Renfro & Co from

446
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,790
Cambridge University they looked at

447
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,270
personality across three hundred three

448
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,920
hundred eighty local area districts in

449
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,160
in the UK they did this with the US as

450
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
well over States I've not found a

451
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,460
similar thing for Canada that would be

452
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,760
interesting to look at and what this

453
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,550
notion is at the bottom essentially is

454
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,750
personality the Big Five personality

455
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,030
traits of openness conscientiousness

456
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,100
extraversion agreeableness and

457
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,970
neuroticism

458
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,460
we shall sometimes hear called emotional

459
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,790
stability well there's been quite a lot

460
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,679
of study into authoritarianism and the

461
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,570
big five of personality and essentially

462
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,510
it looks a little bit like this so

463
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,200
people who are lower in authoritarianism

464
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,880
like people who are let me start again

465
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,130
people who are high in or

466
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,070
authoritarianism tend to have higher

467
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,260
degrees of conscientiousness and lower

468
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,710
degrees of openness so openness is

469
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,570
associated with like creativity and

470
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,220
stuff like that so you're all Thorat

471
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,400
Aryans are less if you like less

472
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,670
creative as a group not individuals they

473
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,980
should say and and the conscientiousness

474
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,960
is related to kind of tradition and

475
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,150
those kinds of things that we've already

476
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,770
looked at there wasn't a great deal of

477
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,679
difference between extraversion

478
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,890
agreeableness but for neuroticism that's

479
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,600
kind of related to openness as well

480
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
because the theory is that people live

481
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
in a more nebulous world therefore a

482
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,110
more stressful world and therefore you

483
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,820
know there's a little bit higher you

484
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,070
not Siddim so what we did we took the

485
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,540
results from from rent rose paper and we

486
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,220
kind of plot them on this graph here

487
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,080
with openness which we reverse and

488
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
conscientiousness because openness and

489
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,290
conscientiousness are pretty good

490
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,020
indicators of authoritarianism then we

491
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,020
took all of the vote data from the

492
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,240
brexit campaign and we plotted it on a

493
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,310
graph like that while we plotted it on

494
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,780
this graph not a graph like this one

495
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,110
this one and essentially what you can

496
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,080
see to the top right hand of the screen

497
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,110
yeah is the sort of high authoritarian

498
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,330
groups these are the local area

499
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,450
districts in the UK they're a predicted

500
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,920
based on personality to be higher in

501
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,860
authoritarianism and those two to the

502
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,260
bottom-left lower in authoritarianism

503
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,020
I'll explain kind of actually what we

504
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,640
did is we we ran some machine learning

505
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,190
against it to just see you know how

506
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,570
predictive it would be I'll talk more

507
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,850
about that in a second so what we wanted

508
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,730
to do was pick five or so towns that

509
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,110
we'd be pretty happy with being in the

510
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,690
lower authoritarian category and five or

511
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,670
so towns have been high authority in

512
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,990
category and essentially what we found

513
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,890
is local authoritarian our towns and

514
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,780
cities that probably most of you have

515
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,520
heard of Cambridge to Liverpool

516
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,010
Manchester Edinburgh and my favorite was

517
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,900
Hackney cuz it's a conference right that

518
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
was actually the least authoritarian

519
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,210
local area district in the UK so that's

520
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:26,750
pretty sweet

521
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,530
and then high authoritarianism these are

522
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,030
towns that you're less likely to have

523
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,700
heard of I would suggest unless you like

524
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,710
to gain the amazing frog in which case

525
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,040
you've heard of Swindon right so like

526
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,480
three people will get that but I'm a big

527
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,890
pungent fan so I talked about the

528
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,660
predictiveness of this we we didn't do

529
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,130
anything fancy we just used a simple

530
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,210
logistic regression with openness and

531
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,620
conscientiousness and we found it was

532
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,460
pretty pretty good at classifying which

533
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,080
areas were going to vote for brexit in

534
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,270
which which weren't so geography we know

535
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,580
now that we can go to these towns and

536
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,080
we'll pipe these into our Facebook

537
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,050
target audiences along with the the age

538
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,710
and

539
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,030
and sex data then we get to Facebook

540
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,130
interests and this is a tool that's

541
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,200
available to researchers but not the

542
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,470
general public as such by Michael

543
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,240
Kaczynski and folks like that who at

544
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,800
Cambridge although Kozinski's at

545
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,320
Stanford now believes and essentially

546
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,780
what this lets you do is use the slider

547
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,790
bars to say well this is the store the

548
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,300
personality profile I'm going for I want

549
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,400
you to spit out the sorts of Facebook

550
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,410
interests that people with disability

551
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,940
sort of shape would go for and you can

552
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,160
put in more information about that what

553
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,140
we did we kept it pretty simple because

554
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,240
we're doing an initial study into this

555
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,430
not you know not the next level of

556
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,070
involvement so we we just used what

557
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,170
faith the Facebook interests will

558
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,270
actually roll up into liberalism and

559
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,970
conservatism so you know we clearly will

560
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,190
put those in and then we chose two of

561
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,110
the newspapers that are widely read in

562
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,230
the UK which are the Guardian for the

563
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,970
lower authoritarian category and the

564
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,150
mail online for the higher authoritarian

565
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,450
category so for our baseline these are

566
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,070
the percentage of people who agree with

567
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,540
the nothing to hide enough interfere

568
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,260
argument about 38% if we just look at

569
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,090
the age sex and location data if we

570
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,190
target the level authoritarian group or

571
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,110
who we think too we see the drop go from

572
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,650
38 to 32 not statistically significant

573
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,340
but still you know if you're looking at

574
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,840
getting a bang for your buck through ads

575
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,990
then it kind of works and for the high

576
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,760
authoritarian group we see that go from

577
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,530
38 to 46 but when we add the the

578
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,500
behavioral information in the liberalism

579
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,630
and the newspaper and that's all we

580
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,040
chose at this point we didn't go more

581
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,410
granular we see that becomes starts to

582
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,320
become significant and drops from 38 to

583
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,110
25% whereas if we go for the high

584
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,160
authoritarian group we have a pretty

585
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,250
highly significant difference of 38 61

586
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,440
so now we can target those groups those

587
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,990
are the high authoritarianism group with

588
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,190
messages that are going to start

589
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,050
resonating with them so not only do we

590
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,010
know that there are differences and

591
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,680
actually how we might manipulate them

592
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,150
but we also know that the targeting

593
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,830
seems to actually give us a bang for the

594
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,070
book in terms of ads so okay the next

595
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,810
question then is well how persuasive a

596
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,740
targeted ads well to use the words of

597
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,970
alexander nix the CEO cambridge

598
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,320
analytically said if you know the

599
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,640
personality of the people you're

600
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,320
targeting you can you answer your

601
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,180
messaging to resonate more effectively

602
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,450
with those key audience groups so you

603
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,300
don't take my word for it right so it's

604
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,340
been a study from this fine some folks

605
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,650
from over the other side of Canada

606
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,270
actually I think in Calgary Hirsch can

607
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,430
Bowden housing they conducted study in

608
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,890
2012 looked at personality in relation

609
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,770
to mobile phone ads so they created five

610
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,720
distinct ads for each of the personality

611
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,390
five personality traits and this one was

612
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,430
for extraversion so with X phone and

613
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,990
you'll always be where the excitement is

614
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,900
party right you don't want to miss it

615
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,870
and the next personality trait here

616
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,640
would stay safe from secure with X phone

617
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,670
that was for neuroticism and what they

618
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,880
found was these did correlate with

619
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,270
people's personality traits so you know

620
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,640
that they suggested that you'd get some

621
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
bang for the book in targeting people

622
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,050
with these sorts of ads next we've got

623
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,390
researchers from Cambridge again mats

624
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,640
Popov Kaczynski instill wealth they

625
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,880
created ads for the same beauty product

626
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,240
one aimed at introverts one aimed

627
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,830
extroverts as you can see here and they

628
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,080
found that the ads targeted at the

629
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
various groups performed as they would

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,830
have expected essentially so the ads

631
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,410
targeted at the introvert group had more

632
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,060
clicks from people who were in the into

633
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,670
the introverted category and they did

634
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,620
another study follow I mean following on

635
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,170
from there with Hilton hotel brands to

636
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,480
look at using that for getting people to

637
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,830
choose their you know that their

638
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,180
vacation so it's pretty interesting

639
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,790
stuff and you can Google away with that

640
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,800
so for out study what we did is we

641
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,690
wanted to take ad to name them at the

642
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,250
high authority in group and a-level

643
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,040
authoritarian group but we wanted to

644
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,320
look at a pro and an anti serve alien

645
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,100
surveillance agenda essentially so we

646
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,160
created four ads for the pro ad it's

647
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,420
like terrorists don't let them hide

648
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,410
online using pitch

649
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,040
of 911 for the level authoritarians that

650
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,050
we want to sort of nudge into a pro to

651
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,430
valence support we we actually try and

652
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,110
suggest that crime doesn't stop where

653
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,910
the internet starts and look at all of

654
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,680
the crimes that happen not just focusing

655
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,380
on terrorism for the local authority in

656
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,790
group who we want to keep in a

657
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,780
anti-surveillance support we have this

658
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,820
picture of Anne Frank with do you really

659
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,230
have nothing to fear if you've got

660
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,410
nothing to hide and then for the high

661
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,880
authoritarian group based on their

662
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,710
affinity for military and tradition and

663
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,060
respect for elders we've got you know

664
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,230
they fought for your freedom

665
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,870
don't give it away so we measure it in

666
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,280
this way we've got first of all we

667
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,020
presented all of the ads to all

668
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,960
participants and then we looked at the

669
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,210
correlation between how much people like

670
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,040
the ads versus their levels of

671
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,350
authoritarianism so we broke that

672
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,150
self-reported levels down to low medium

673
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,120
high authoritarianism and then the

674
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,980
amount that people found the ABS

675
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,320
persuasive through five questions which

676
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,660
replicated the bodenhouse and study

677
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,020
we look at that so for the for the the

678
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,320
don't let terrorists hide online

679
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,760
questions we see that it's got you know

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,380
it's got more support from people high

681
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,450
in authoritarianism as we've expect

682
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,080
unless support from people lower where

683
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,130
we see the ads based on the crime

684
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,750
doesn't stop where the internet starts

685
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,050
we see actually that you've got

686
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,010
beginning to get you've got the same

687
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,780
level of support ish for the high

688
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,310
authority own items but now you're

689
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,690
bringing up the low and the medium in

690
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,520
terms of how much they they like the ad

691
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,980
or say they do and then for the low

692
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,750
earth or attaining group we see that low

693
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,820
authoritarians like being nothing to

694
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,470
fear nothing to hide and Frank ad

695
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,640
whereas a high authorities don't so much

696
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,190
and but what we saw which was surprising

697
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,800
was the ad that was meant to pull up the

698
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
high end medium authoritarian group

699
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,300
which it does also appealed to the

700
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,180
people who were low in authoritarianism

701
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,910
so that was pretty pretty interesting to

702
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,960
see so we see that the ads do resonate

703
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,610
with these different groups but we

704
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,120
wanted

705
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,950
to them go you know the next step and

706
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,750
essentially test that out online prove

707
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,600
like look at the efficacy of that so we

708
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,390
we used the audience's that we had found

709
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,940
from the previous study where we had

710
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,780
like the you know the different age sex

711
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,830
Facebook interests and what have you

712
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,390
that we were able to target with these

713
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,030
different ads essentially we've got

714
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,800
those different audiences listed against

715
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,680
this axis and then we've got the ratio

716
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,700
here likes to shares by by the reach of

717
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,730
the the ad so what we see here is that

718
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,920
it wasn't an ad it was a boosted

719
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,420
Facebook post just a little different so

720
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,470
we see that the people in the high

721
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,300
authority and group really kind of liked

722
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,100
that Adam will click through it pretty

723
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,110
pretty happily but people lower in

724
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,030
authoritarianism aren't going to click

725
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,309
so much on that ad or you know that that

726
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,550
boosted post what we see here with the

727
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,890
local authoritarian group is that the ad

728
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,410
kind of bombed and Facebook warned us

729
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,030
about that because it said you've got a

730
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,890
lot of text in this ad you know

731
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,660
essentially paraphrasing it said ads

732
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,130
with a lot of text silk and people

733
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,070
aren't going to click on them so that's

734
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,750
kind of a lesson learned but what is

735
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,040
interesting is that the correlation

736
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,380
coefficient kind of got lower so if we

737
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,270
get the a dry presumably we'll be able

738
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,550
to bring up you know people who are in

739
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,200
the level authoritarian category that

740
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,220
needs more research clearly for the for

741
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,830
looking at people clicking on to the

742
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,220
anti-surveillance ads with nothing to

743
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,260
fear nothing to hide on Frank ad we see

744
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,890
kind of what we expected from from what

745
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,830
people told us they would do but what

746
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,690
got really interesting was them for the

747
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,760
anti surveillance thing with the you

748
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,030
know you know that they fought for your

749
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,790
freedom don't give it away essentially

750
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,170
what we see is that that's brought up

751
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,990
not just the low who we already kind of

752
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,790
have in the bag anyway who are you like

753
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,410
your base condition and they're going to

754
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,179
support you you also bring up the

755
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,920
support for the for the people high in

756
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,350
authoritarianism so one of the takeaways

757
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,080
which is kind of unexpected was that if

758
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,559
you want to nudge people the other away

759
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,480
in that nothing to fear nothing to hide

760
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,570
argument then for the authoritarian guru

761
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,880
you might want to look at using this

762
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,220
argument of you know they fought for

763
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,840
your freedom don't don't give it away

764
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,720
and again much lower correlation

765
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,420
coefficient so after all that you might

766
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,590
still be asking yeah but does it work

767
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,300
right all you've really shown me is that

768
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,920
people click on ads but is it persuasive

769
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,540
which is a fair statement so there is

770
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,890
some research in this and it

771
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,420
unfortunately difficult to replicate

772
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,600
because they had these guys from Germany

773
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,260
and they they they had a sample of eight

774
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,210
thousand citizens in Germany and

775
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,310
essentially this was regarding attitudes

776
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,010
to transatlantic trade and they took a

777
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,470
baseline survey of people's support for

778
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,700
it that's kind of the zero there and

779
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,990
those I you know so that's the baseline

780
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,910
support people for and against it but

781
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,750
then what they did is they sent a

782
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,060
section of that that demographic if you

783
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,250
like that those 8,000 they sent them

784
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,650
positive information like literature

785
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,500
about what transatlantic trade is and

786
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,600
you know what the benefits of it are and

787
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,850
then they looked at the results of you

788
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,530
know whether you know they reran the

789
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,360
surveys to look at whether people were

790
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,250
supportive or not of transatlantic trade

791
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,650
partnership and that increased like

792
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,350
significantly in the weeks following

793
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,110
having received that literature it

794
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,000
dropped off a bit when they then did a

795
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,450
follow-on study some some months later

796
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,150
but it you know just suggests

797
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,470
essentially if you want to get the

798
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,940
message out you have to keep going with

799
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,490
it because over time it's going to go

800
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,900
back down to whatever the default

801
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,080
baseline was so if you're interested in

802
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,210
persuasion there are a number of books

803
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,770
O'Keefe has written a book about

804
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,020
persuasion but these guys are worth

805
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,000
following because they're researching

806
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,820
this is there's just not a lot of

807
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,190
research about how persuasion actually

808
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,930
works possibly because of the ethics

809
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,920
involved with it so okay now we said

810
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,900
we've shown that yes theoretically it's

811
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,050
possible and in practice it seems to

812
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,600
seems to have some some effect or be it

813
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,360
small we see well okay if you've got

814
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,040
this message out there how easy is it to

815
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,280
debunk propaganda so we turn to

816
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,669
research by a Yale professor Dan kahan

817
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,870
essentially what he did he took audience

818
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,970
part you know his participants for his

819
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,980
survey and he randomly assigned them to

820
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,700
one of four categories a B C or D the

821
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,070
folks in categories a and B got a

822
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,950
question about how well skin cream works

823
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,049
in clearing of a ranch for the people in

824
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,870
a they get a number grid like this and

825
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,320
they have to say okay which one was it

826
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,970
people who use the skin cream were more

827
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,200
likely to get better than those who

828
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,299
didn't or people who use the skin cream

829
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,100
were more likely to get worse and they

830
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,169
had to choose the right the right number

831
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:54,789
essentially and put you out of your

832
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,549
misery for this one it was 75 and for

833
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,470
the B group essentially the same

834
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,100
question they just switched the the top

835
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,830
line round so instead of it saying rash

836
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,900
got better it says rash got worse so

837
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,840
you've kind of got that control in there

838
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,510
you know they they go both those people

839
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,219
that question that way around so it

840
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,679
switches they got worse for those people

841
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,918
but what kahan did down he gave people

842
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:24,550
in Group C and D a question about gun

843
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,609
control and crime and that led some

844
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,800
interesting results actually so we

845
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,480
replicated his work and this is what

846
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,190
I'll share because it's essentially the

847
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,560
same kind of results we chose we

848
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,969
switched the question to one about

849
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,250
immigration because in brexit this whole

850
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,879
immigration thing was was one of the one

851
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,980
of the major contributions to the way

852
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,409
people voted so looking at the results

853
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,109
for the skin cream results what we see

854
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,710
is there for both people who voted leave

855
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,000
and remain you know they're pretty

856
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,830
similar being able to interpret the

857
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,940
numbers but when you get to immigration

858
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,099
decreases crime people who voted leave

859
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,290
are just kind of unable to see the

860
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,330
answer if you like whereas people who

861
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,190
voted remain their performance improves

862
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,410
but then if you switch that round to

863
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,880
suggest that immigration actually

864
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,430
increases crime then the leaf performers

865
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,230
get a boost or like a yeah I told you so

866
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,560
right and the the remain campaigns are

867
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,820
like none and I'm like don't want to

868
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,480
fake news so essentially this concert

869
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,770
was described as the most depressing

870
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,020
brain finding ever or if you're looking

871
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,670
for this in like Google Scholar or what

872
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,390
have you

873
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,550
motivated reasoning or ideologically

874
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,090
motivated reasoning motivated numeracy

875
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,740
and you know there's various

876
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,900
descriptions for it so what we did in

877
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,180
this study what we wanted to do was to

878
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,280
look at the surveillance aspect so we

879
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,550
again did the skin cream questions and

880
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,520
found broadly the same sorts of results

881
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,200
but what we did instead of asking a

882
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,230
question about gun control or about

883
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,120
immigration that we really asked a

884
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,510
question around surveillance increases

885
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,610
or decreases to threat of terror so

886
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,350
actually increased levels of

887
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,690
surveillance would have an effect one

888
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,630
way or the other what we found is there

889
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,060
for people who agree with there nothing

890
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,570
to hide nothing to fear argument if

891
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,870
they're shown numbers that suggest that

892
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,820
surveillance actually increases the

893
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,420
threat ie

894
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,670
doesn't work is that their performance

895
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,030
in answering a question like dropped and

896
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,050
performance also dropped a little bit

897
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,940
for people who disagree that's probably

898
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,680
due to the complexity of the question

899
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,990
actually in the wording of the question

900
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,480
but when we flip it round we see a

901
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,450
similar sort of trend to what we saw in

902
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,970
cans of internal paper and the brexit

903
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,570
paper is that people who disagree with

904
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,010
the statement it's their performance

905
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,180
that drops and the people that agree

906
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,560
with it they get a boost because it's

907
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,240
like yeah surveillance decreases a

908
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,120
threat ie it does work so we should use

909
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,540
it and this phenomenon this motivated

910
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,290
reasoning

911
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,260
it gets worse with age as well so you

912
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,580
know people say younger voters don't

913
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,260
know what they're voting for but it so

914
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,700
it seems that as people get older they

915
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,200
get more entrenched in these ideological

916
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,570
views and there some possible reasons

917
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,760
for that so it's interesting research to

918
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
follow because if you're wanting to use

919
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,680
facts to debunk and add or to debunk a

920
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,680
narrative you your going to come up with

921
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,670
some some some problems so bringing us

922
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,040
to the conclusions and discussion

923
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,420
essentially we looked at five things

924
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,430
here right we looked at why people so

925
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,770
divided authoritarianism isn't the only

926
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,450
reason but it plays a large factor in

927
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,700
some of these some of these current

928
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,000
bullets

929
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,850
called discussions what influences have

930
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,740
used lots of things influencers

931
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,790
influenced their views but yeah anxiety

932
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,420
and anger certainly play a part we know

933
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,100
that we can target these different

934
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,040
groups otherwise people wouldn't do it

935
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,020
which they kind of do and you get a bang

936
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,580
for your book so what we're finding with

937
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,250
the ads are you might go up it we'd have

938
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,660
no proof that it worked increase the

939
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,950
click-through rate so we're getting a

940
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,300
bigger bang for our book at the very

941
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,020
least then how persuasive are they you

942
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,730
know again we're seeing that certain

943
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,650
narrative certain texts and images have

944
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,080
an effect and people are you know kind

945
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,400
of researching that quite a bit if

946
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,170
you're looking for a video online really

947
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,960
recommend D Madigan's work she is an

948
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,530
advertising creative in the in Australia

949
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,720
and is a great talk on propaganda and

950
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,180
then we find you know who I just spoke

951
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,720
about debunking propaganda has some some

952
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,970
challenges so one question that was

953
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,920
asked of me as well if both sides use

954
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,980
this kind of tactic don't the effects

955
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,280
just equal out but I think actually it

956
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,140
kind of depends on the starting position

957
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,180
so you've already got momentum on one

958
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,710
side versus the other and there's an

959
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,450
example of that in if we were going to

960
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,100
have a referendum on shutting down the

961
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,710
darknet tomorrow then the people who

962
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,270
were saying shut down the darknet have

963
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,350
already got home-field advantage

964
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,510
essentially so they can double down on

965
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,420
that so that means that the playing

966
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,860
field for some of these isn't level and

967
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,240
by doubling down on it is you're

968
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,520
increasing the anxiety to bring up your

969
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,620
the the people who wouldn't ordinarily

970
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,630
support it same thing with immigration

971
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,220
same thing with death penalty same thing

972
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,480
with all of these things you could do

973
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,540
that it's not gonna nudge it like

974
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,450
massively but a few percentage points is

975
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,160
probably enough in some cases we had

976
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,680
elections in the UK last year where

977
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,210
people won by a handful of votes

978
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,850
literally won by you know a few hundred

979
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,730
votes so in those scenarios yeah it can

980
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,090
be it can be effective so you know I

981
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,370
mentioned the use of fear there's been

982
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,090
some some studies into political ads and

983
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,440
how they motivate and persuade voters

984
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,130
this one by braver in 2005 he suggests

985
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,710
images with smiling children colorful

986
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,580
images are less likely to be effective

987
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,619
people are much more motivated to click

988
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:04,780
on ads and look at articles if it's

989
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,609
grainy black and white images which is

990
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:08,530
why we chose the black and white images

991
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,260
for you know for our study so if you can

992
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,330
like double down on the fear aspect with

993
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,250
the grainy images and you get the grainy

994
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,920
image and stuff right then you're gonna

995
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,839
get some abs that people are going to

996
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
click on a little bit more at least in

997
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,150
theory so what might we do about

998
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,580
tackling the problem well I'm not sure

999
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,710
how many people are familiar with this

1000
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,830
lady is Jane Elliott and essentially

1001
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,420
what she did she did this blue eyes

1002
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,550
brown eyes experiment where she divided

1003
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,109
the classroom into children with blue

1004
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:39,609
eyes and children with brown eyes and

1005
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:43,180
she used that to look at you know raise

1006
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,980
awareness of racism essentially we were

1007
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,180
in the classroom without mentioning

1008
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,570
color

1009
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,280
well I color and that's been pretty

1010
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,619
pretty interesting work that she's done

1011
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,920
for you know for decades so the point

1012
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,680
with this is we could do something

1013
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,119
similar but raising people's awareness

1014
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,119
of their own biases so if you're looking

1015
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,859
at the debunking of propaganda if you

1016
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,359
know that you've got a bias already you

1017
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,710
might want to double-check the numbers

1018
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,260
or you know what have you so there's

1019
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,490
some work that could be done about

1020
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,490
educating people on biases it's not just

1021
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,680
about political campaigns when people

1022
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,450
buy cars you know you see this the

1023
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,390
number on the screen that's the anchor

1024
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,210
so you know educating people about how

1025
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,800
they're being suckered in by their own

1026
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,369
biases myself included raises awareness

1027
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:32,619
so there's not not necessarily a bad

1028
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:33,970
thing it might be an effective strategy

1029
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,280
in in tackling some of the stuff that

1030
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,330
we're seeing today

1031
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,690
the other thing is numeracy so once we

1032
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,609
get the biases sorted out then maybe we

1033
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,250
can raise people's ability in numeracy

1034
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,980
because it was shockingly poor in the UK

1035
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,810
it's shockingly poor in the u.s. as well

1036
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,480
I don't know about Canada actually so we

1037
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
saw low levels and that's been found in

1038
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,680
lots of different papers and research

1039
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,190
and surveys so if you can educate people

1040
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,230
about the biases and then increase the

1041
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,550
numbers and they're going to make better

1042
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,890
decisions and there's been a lot of

1043
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,900
research into numeracy and healthcare

1044
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,820
choices because people repeatedly make

1045
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,299
port

1046
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:14,140
choices based on well one of the factors

1047
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,119
involved is a you know an inability to

1048
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,849
really determine the risk so sometimes

1049
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:21,309
you'll hear this term this numerical lip

1050
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,309
risk illiteracy and the final one the

1051
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,410
reason I left it to last words or rules

1052
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,660
and regulations there's like yeah you do

1053
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,519
need some rules and regulations I think

1054
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,949
one guy Cambridge analytical said well

1055
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,539
it's just the same as advertising

1056
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:37,599
toothpaste right but now it's not

1057
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,799
because actually you've got tighter

1058
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,900
controls in the UK at least for

1059
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,239
advertising toothpaste you can spend a

1060
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,160
whole web of lies for a political

1061
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,589
campaign use questionable numbers and

1062
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:49,589
statistics which you just can't do

1063
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:52,150
advertising toothpaste so you know you

1064
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,640
can google the Electoral Commission in

1065
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,799
the in the UK for that so that kind of

1066
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:59,170
needs tightening tightening up but I

1067
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,539
think rules and regulations aren't going

1068
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:03,609
to do it on their own but the

1069
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:05,559
transparency discussions that we're

1070
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,789
seeing right now with regards to

1071
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,160
Facebook and Twitter and whatnot I think

1072
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,559
will be interesting to see how that kind

1073
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,529
of works out so hopefully I've finished

1074
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:17,890
just about on time and we've got a few

1075
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,719
minutes left over so I can I've got some

1076
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,029
some other slides so if anybody wants to

1077
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:24,189
contact me I'm Chris online privacy

1078
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:25,989
foundation

1079
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:29,109
I'm also Stuckey on Twitter

1080
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:34,410
it's 5u GG y x5 looks like an S right so

1081
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,029
because I've got like five minutes left

1082
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:40,989
over one of the questions around sort of

1083
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,039
the differences

1084
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:45,339
how do people you know how does this

1085
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,349
actually happen because people aren't

1086
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:49,569
really that different to start with so

1087
00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:51,369
there's been research into into this and

1088
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,049
some some books written about it as well

1089
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:55,660
is you know take a listen Bob because

1090
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,039
we're at a security conference and they

1091
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,079
start off with broadly similar attitudes

1092
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:00,819
to surveillance and they're having a

1093
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:03,009
discussion one go one person oh you know

1094
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:04,359
actually I think there's something in

1095
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,729
this you know nothing to hide nothing to

1096
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:09,309
fear argument and then they start maybe

1097
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:11,319
seeing more of those ads which resonate

1098
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,349
with them and what happens is that one

1099
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,150
person is going to start migrating down

1100
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,219
one side of the triangle and the other

1101
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:19,929
person who says yeah well I've seen how

1102
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:22,119
you know this anti surveillance stuff is

1103
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,320
leading to

1104
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,240
being arrested erosion of privacy and

1105
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,060
it's bad for you know society and they

1106
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,590
start seeing that and what happens

1107
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,540
people who were generally fairly close

1108
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,180
start advancing down the triangle until

1109
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,040
their life poles apart and that's why it

1110
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,880
feels like there's polarization in

1111
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,960
politics so the challenge is like how

1112
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,610
you overcome that because essentially

1113
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,380
you're - you're you've got to overcome

1114
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,510
not only people's biases but also a

1115
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,220
cognitive dissonance where they're not

1116
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,110
going to be readily willing to admit

1117
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,390
that they were maybe wrong in there in

1118
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,160
the first place

1119
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,820
in terms of targeting people based on

1120
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,160
personality this was a graph from out

1121
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,880
study that we did in 2012 or something

1122
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,180
like that and we found that for the top

1123
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,440
10% of people who in the personality

1124
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,690
trait of openness the prediction rate

1125
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,650
was 75% that really were in the top 10%

1126
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,840
and that was back in 2012 with some

1127
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,970
pretty crude measures things of you know

1128
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,430
advanced quite considerably you know now

1129
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,440
in that so you know you can go and check

1130
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,890
out what what different apps think about

1131
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,360
your personality there's this one here

1132
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,110
called data selfie which you run in you

1133
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,790
know in a browser essentially it

1134
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,380
monitors what you're doing with you know

1135
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,970
Facebook and then says hey you know I

1136
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,630
think you're you know liberal you know

1137
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,300
what have you I never you know other

1138
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,500
versions of with this as well you've got

1139
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,890
IBM's you've got the the receptivity is

1140
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,960
based on the language that people use

1141
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,510
and in the bottom you've got like a it's

1142
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,260
called apply magic sauce so you know

1143
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,420
that like looks at my I have not got the

1144
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,310
slide in it but it was like well you

1145
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,900
know we think you're a fairly liberal

1146
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,850
but we've got this question mark because

1147
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,730
you like Top Gun and you like skiing in

1148
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,350
Jackson Hole Wyoming and because you

1149
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,000
like Wyoming well mmm

1150
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,250
you know it's like we're pretty sure but

1151
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,580
these are a question marks so what I'm

1152
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,770
trying to suggest is that the ability to

1153
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,080
look at people's personality through

1154
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,400
their social media profiles is actually

1155
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,090
there's actually advanced

1156
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,410
considerably since we first started

1157
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,440
looking at it so with that I think that

1158
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,150
brings us to actually the end I probably

1159
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,730
got a couple minutes for some questions

1160
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,960
but I'll be around you know this evening

1161
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,870
if people have more so that's it folks
