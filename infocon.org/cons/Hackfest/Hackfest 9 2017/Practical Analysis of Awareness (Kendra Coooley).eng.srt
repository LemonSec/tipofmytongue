1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
all of the rest of you I'm Kendra Cooley

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,310
if you can't tell by my awesome accent

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,330
I'm from the US so don't throw things at

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,230
me alright so the name of this talk is

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,690
practical analysis of awareness but what

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,970
I really wanted to call this talk was

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,250
your 6% quick rate doesn't mean now

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,949
how many of you guys run like fishing

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,820
campaigns where you work good click

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,349
rates you guys know haven't you want to

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,630
throw out there and share well ok

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:42,750
14% 25% took what 40% ouch

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,879
all right so I think based on your click

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,230
rate we can pretty much just say like

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,930
your security warnings program probably

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,149
needs to mark maybe right all right so

17
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:51,930
that's what we're going to talk about

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,140
today and I promise I will stay on time

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,260
here all right so the technical stuff of

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,109
for Who am I so I got my bachelor's in

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,480
digital forensics from Davenport

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,159
University which is like a no-name

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,220
school in Michigan I didn't even know

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,600
what the mascot was that's how much I

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,659
didn't pay attention so apparently I was

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,180
a panther which is pretty cool I have my

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,340
CISSP which means you can trust me I

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,810
specialize in incident response that's

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,869
definitely what I prefer to do on a

30
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,580
daily basis

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,990
and then also security awareness

32
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,159
training is something that's really

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,630
really near and dear to my heart

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,950
so that's kind of what I'm talking about

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,040
this today and I'm also most importantly

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,500
this beautiful lady's opening act today

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,299
so all right now the non-technical stuff

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,500
American as I said move sorry

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,509
animal lover I have three dogs three

40
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,049
ducks

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,829
yes ducks and a goose that just showed

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,530
up one day and never left weird I also

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,590
love wine and do-it-yourself projects

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,600
Pinterest has literally been the death

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,350
of me I've built all different kinds of

46
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,700
things really badly that have pretty

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,098
much all fallen apart and I love to tell

48
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,780
stories so hopefully we'll get a chance

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,580
to talk about some different stuff while

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
I'm up here all right

51
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,880
so for those of you that are not

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,980
familiar with the us that is what it

53
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,680
looks like I am from Michigan that

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,060
little yellow dot and most recently I

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,950
worked for duo security great company

56
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,190
loved it but it's time for me to move on

57
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,860
so I'm shipping myself to Atlanta in

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,010
like 20 days and I will be working for

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,710
MailChimp so yes I'm scared to say hello

60
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,490
he's still better whether you're

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,570

62
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,690
but I know nobody there so if you guys

63
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,010

area please feel free to send him my way

65
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,480
I need friends so for the last year what

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,700
I did at do security was I built their

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,140
Incident Response program from the

68
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,840
ground up it was really really super

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,420
exciting work I loved it so when it came

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,620
time for me to find a new job

71
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,090
I knew that was something that I wanted

72
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,570
to focus on again so luckily I'm going

73
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,130
to be doing the exact same thing and

74
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,050
Bale chimp so I will be building their

75
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,520
incident response program again from the

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,720
ground up and then also helping with

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,260
their security awareness program I love

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,830
this shirt

79
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,170
I just compass out of forever 21 one day

80
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,550
and I had to take pictures because I

81
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,560
thought it was so great so yes excuse my

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,950
French

83
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,500
I don't speak any now most of the time

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
when you hear people they're like oh I'm

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,590
going to learning a new language or you

86
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,940
come across somebody who speaks a new

87
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,530
language what's the first thing that you

88
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,470
want them to teach you how to say swear

89
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,670
words I learned fruits because I'm weird

90
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,770
so I don't speak any French I could tell

91
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,640

92
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,990

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,540
around the room and we're gonna talk

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,150
about who you guys are totally kidding

97
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,800
there's no time for that

98
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,510
but just by showing hands because I do

99
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,650
want to know a little bit more about

100
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,480
like my audience how many of you guys in

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,600

blue team er yeah awesome that's awesome

104
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,238
now how many of you guys actually

105
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,500
participate in like the security

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,150
awareness program at the place that you

107
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,120
work create it

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,180
awesome it's rewarding work isn't it

109
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,979
great alright going so why are you here

110
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,889
I paid you yes a few of you I did pay to

111
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,520
show up no but at the end of the day our

112
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,380
decisions generally come down to whether

113
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,210
it's something that's organic we're

114
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,250
doing it because we want to or it's

115
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,650
mandated either one of those two things

116
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,750
pretty much drive every decision that we

117
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,889
make in our lives right

118
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,300
so for those of you that are here

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,770
organically that put your butts in the

120
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,240
seats because you just wanted to see my

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,990
face

122
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,250
you're not the people on the front here

123
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,570
you have genuine interest in this topic

124
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,590
hopefully you came to learn now for

125
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,240
those of you that were mandated to be

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,479
here it's obligatory right like dinging

127
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,370
I guess I'll go watch because otherwise

128
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,690
sure just give me the stink-eye for the

129
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,860
rest of the conference and I want to

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,280
deal with that you came to check a box

131
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,520
potentially right how many of you guys

132
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,350
think about your security awareness

133
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,850
programs in kind of a similar fashion

134
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,160
how many of you guys feel like it's so

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,919
much just check the box meet that

136
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,160
compliance requirement that's really

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
unfortunate because of the fact that we

138
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,030
want our employees to have a genuine

139
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,860
interest in security we want them to

140
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,770
feel that it's something organic in the

141
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,599
culture we want a good security or a

142
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,220
nice culture at our place to work it's

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,990
Michelle Obama here telling us we got to

144
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,560
take our education seriously and we do

145
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,910
but how do you force someone to take

146
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,919
their education seriously I mean take a

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,120
look at me for example I didn't even

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,370
know what my school's mascot was because

149
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,020
I did the absolute fun so you know

150
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,550
basically how I do everything my life I

151
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,349
I officially finished these slides like

152
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:16,229
20 minutes before I got up here so it's

153
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,410
a good thing the last one ran late

154
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,310
alright so we're going to talk about

155
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,510
four different things today we're going

156
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,800
to talk about the current state of

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,660
security awareness we're also going to

158
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,479
talk about what we're getting wrong and

159
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,550
if your problem or how do we know if

160
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,610
your program is successful aside from

161
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,050
just that six percent click rate that

162
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,570
you're touting or forty percent I guess

163
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,780
in some cases now we're also going to

164
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,039
talk a little bit about how we can

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,360
our efforts when it comes to security

166
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,699
awareness so the current state of

167
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,499
security awareness everybody in here is

168
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:47,759
familiar with security awareness

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,649
programs I would hope so we're not going

170
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:50,999
to go through too much of like what it

171
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,979
actually is but for the most part when

172
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,659
you look at it you're breaking it down

173
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,270
into different types of trading whether

174
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,509
it be like an online learning module or

175
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,499
National Cyber Security Awareness Month

176
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,680
which we all just finished or fake

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,930
phishing campaigns everyone's seen those

178
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,789
fake phishing campaigns we have all

179
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,020
participated in an NCAA celebrations and

180
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,550
things like that but what happens as

181
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,839
soon as NC Sam is over nobody gives a

182
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,889
 right so that's exactly one of the

183
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,059
biggest problems when it comes to

184
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,139
security awareness training is it

185
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,520
happens once a year and then we just

186
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,529
forget about it we just move on to the

187
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:29,789
rest of the day to day stuff and hope

188
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,710
people absorbed it but what about those

189
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,659
people that are hiring in November first

190
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:36,779
that missed it telling me they got away

191
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,759
all the way into October to make a bunch

192
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,169
of security mistakes before we're gonna

193
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,669
train them that's definitely not a good

194
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:49,110
way to go so what is it baking crisis I

195
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,719
think is the is the term I think that's

196
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,550
kind of what that looks like but that is

197
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,949
how our users feel when they hear that

198
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,629
they have to take a security awareness

199
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,550
training whether it be an online module

200
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,459
or attend a stupid person talking about

201
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,080
security awareness because they think

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,209
they know everything already so it's

203
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,759
like it's it's mandated right it's not

204
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,319
happening organically like we would

205
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,430
prefer so depending on your organization

206
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,379
security awareness can fit in many

207
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,089
different departments so we have like

208
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,800
the security team obviously can can

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,019
house the security awareness program

210
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,159
oftentimes it falls under the umbrella

211
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,469
of compliance sometimes it's you know

212
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,300
the Human Resources team which I don't

213
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,680
know why we would give them that

214
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,529
responsibility legal or the training and

215
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,389
development programming and development

216
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,708
team so it's generally where the

217
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,599
security awareness program is help and

218
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,620
at the end of the day what we're hoping

219
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,078
to do is avoid being that next big

220
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,529
breach in the news right has anybody

221
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,300
here worked for a company that suffered

222
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,510
a breach Wow

223
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,329
it's a bad feeling right yeah so that's

224
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:54,840
what we're trying

225
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,070
to avoid when it comes to security

226
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,150
awareness training we're trying to make

227
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,770
sure that we're educating our users and

228
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,440
making sure that they are aware of the

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,700
things that they shouldn't should not do

230
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,740
to help us to avoid becoming that next

231
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,810
news story and it's up to all of us to

232
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,880
be the ones to educate them but the

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,810
biggest problem when it comes to

234
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,160
security awareness training is the fact

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
that we're not able to connect with our

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,740
users on the things that they actually

237
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,050
care about so it just ends up becoming

238
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,970
all its policy so I guess I'll use

239
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,600
two-factor authentication now one of the

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
biggest questions when you're starting

241
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,290
to build a security awareness program is

242
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,890
whether to build it or buy it now Haydon

243
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,960
here in the front you mentioned that

244
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,250
you're building a security learns for

245
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,310
him from the ground up so when it came

246
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,920
to deciding building or buying what way

247
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,320
did you go all right so he built it from

248
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,730
his pen testing and fishing experience

249
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,440
which is great and at the end of the day

250
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,940
when you boil it down there's a few

251
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,310
things that we're actually looking for

252
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,180
we want to make sure that it's meeting

253
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,620
compliance requirements we want to be

254
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,030
able to check that box even though you

255
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,070
know it's it's it's just checking a box

256
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,500
it's really really important we also are

257
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,390
looking at the price right especially if

258
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,100
we're buying it it has to fit in our

259
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,110
budget depending on your company you

260
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,360
might have a bigger a small budget we

261
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,070
want to educate educate employees at the

262
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,000
end of the day that's what we're really

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,090
looking for and we also want it to be

264
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,420
relevant to our industry if you work for

265
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,940
a hospital

266
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,830
you're going to want stuff that's aimed

267
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,920
a little bit more towards like

268
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,180
personally identifiable information and

269
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,109
protecting all of that data

270
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,490
right yeah privacy is different when it

271
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,330
comes to like the health care industry

272
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,070
and stuff like that so we wanted to be

273
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,590
relevant to our industry now I'm going

274
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,090
to show a bunch of diet options now for

275
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,230
security awareness training I do not

276
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,360
endorse any of these I'm just showing

277
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,730
them all right so we have fish meat

278
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,630
we won't bat the sand you know patch the

279
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,110
human fish line no before we have all of

280
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,720
these different options of companies

281
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,980
that we can pick there are literally

282
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,870
like a thousand more companies out there

283
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,610
that are that are putting together

284
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,590
security awareness programs but at the

285
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,880
end of the day you know you're getting a

286
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,410
package you're getting something that's

287
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,430
kind of like a plug and put a

288
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,930
plug-and-play feature maybe it's you

289
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,190
know online modules and things like that

290
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,050
but it's not really customized

291
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,900
necessarily to your industry or to your

292
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,720
specific needs so to do it yourself and

293
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,940
yes I'm gonna put all this on Pinterest

294
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,410
so that people can do your self security

295
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,090
awareness that'll be the the topic there

296
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,920
so it can still meet those security

297
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,450
requirements or the compliance

298
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,740
requirements that's at the end of the

299
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,430
day that's something that's really

300
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,420
important it can usually cost less than

301
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,000
buying it depending on who's running it

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,290
now if it's me it's probably expensive

303
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,120
uh educate the employees hopefully how

304
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,650
many of you guys have ever like taken an

305
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,930
online training module and just fast

306
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,000
forwarded or put headphones in an option

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,370
yeah what do you think your employees

308
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,050
are doing when you give them an online

309
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,840
security training that module they're

310
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,480
not watching that guarantee yet relevant

311
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,340
to your industry obviously that's very

312
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,900
important we want people to be able to

313
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,550
take something away from it that matters

314
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,890
to them that matters to the things that

315
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,890
they're doing in their day to day lives

316
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,750
also it's challenging to build your own

317
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,840
right ranking it's challenging you have

318
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,480
to figure out where to start where your

319
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,600
employees level of awareness is what's

320
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,140
relevant what actually matters so it's

321
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,760
challenging but at the end you get a

322
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,400
totally personalized security awareness

323
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,180
program which is great and if not you

324
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,720
then who I would have had so many more

325
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,760
amazing gifts in here but the Wi-Fi in

326
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,540
this hotel

327
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,950
oh this one is awesome though so it's

328
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,870
not you then who if you're not going to

329
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,520
build this program if you're not going

330
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,320
to care about security awareness where

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,470
are your users getting their education

332
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:05,120
about security the news okay CNN fake

333
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,740
news or whatever they call it you know

334
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,500
in in USA land well what was that

335
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,420
alternative that I'll turn into facts

336
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,110
absolutely this presentation is full of

337
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,810
those alternative facts I'm just kidding

338
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,730
but yeah it's not you then people are

339
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,000
learning about security in a fear-based

340
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,580
sense unfortunately if you look at the

341
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,840
headlines if you look at the things that

342
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,960
are in the news people are like freaking

343
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,660
out over over you know the next reading

344
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,040
somewhere virus and different things

345
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,600
like that so it's it's really really

346
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,100
poor tactic when it comes to security

347
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,740
awareness we want to create a culture

348
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,550
that's based on education and not fear a

349
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,510
lot of companies like to spread this I

350
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,360
guess culture of paranoia of fear right

351
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,370
they want everybody to be scared

352
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,440
sure it's important we need to be

353
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
cautious but we don't want people to be

354
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,370
fearful we want them to know that at the

355
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,600
end of the day if something happens that

356
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,410
they click something they're not

357
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,360
supposed to they download something they

358
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,300
shouldn't we've got their back that's

359
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,620
what's most important when it comes to a

360
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,560
security awareness program all right so

361
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,530
where are we getting it wrong where do

362
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,670
you guys think we're getting it wrong

363
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,860
when it comes to security awareness good

364
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,150
blaming the user exactly so that goes

365
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,800
also into that fear tactic yep

366
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,959
sorry I'm drinking I feel obligated to

367
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,619
finish this yes personal buying if you

368
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,299
don't personally feel connected to

369
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,699
something or have some personal reason

370
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:42,759
to actually care you're not going to at

371
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,679
the end of the day and for a lot of

372
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,919
users security is the last thing that

373
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,359
they care about they're not going home

374
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,949
at night and talking to their spouses or

375
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:52,569
their kids about being secure online or

376
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,889
using two-factor or using strong

377
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,109
passwords hell most of them are reusing

378
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,089
passwords and and all that kind of stuff

379
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,819
so if we're not able to connect with

380
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:04,079
them then we're really getting it wrong

381
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,239
here's my list of things that's suck all

382
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,699
right special snowflakes how many of you

383
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,309
guys know what those are are your

384
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:14,259
company's full of special snowflakes

385
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,479
that are exempt from security awareness

386
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,799
training oh my gosh so at a company that

387
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,399
I previously worked for not duo just

388
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,729
saying not to uh we had a bunch of

389
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,039
specialist no flakes the entire sea

390
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,669
level so CEO CFO all those guys we were

391
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,449
not allowed to fish them they also

392
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,679
didn't have to take security awareness

393
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,399
training who gets targeted the most in a

394
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,059
thing then the sea level right their

395
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,889
names are on the website it's super easy

396
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:48,999
to figure out what their email addresses

397
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,220
are and they don't know jack squat about

398
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,859
avoiding a phishing email but we're not

399
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:54,879
going to we're not going to play with

400
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,049
them right we're not going to make them

401
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:59,410
go through anything checking the box we

402
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,089
just want to get up there check the box

403
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,939
yep everybody participated in some type

404
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,319
of security awareness training this year

405
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,309
moving on hit or miss with employees

406
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,889
it's another huge thing again going back

407
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,359
to you're not connecting with them

408
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,939
personally so let's say that you have a

409
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,919
security awareness training and you've

410
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,629
got like developers you've got the

411
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,249
entry-level employee who has never had

412
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:22,389
any type of security awareness training

413
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,459
you're speaking to this person probably

414
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,899
you're let's say that our awareness

415
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,179
program is right in the middle this

416
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:30,579
person down here is missing a lot of

417
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,079
stuff because they don't understand it

418
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,729
and the person up here with the higher

419
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:36,669
level of education is like this sucks I

420
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,169
know all of this and they're zoning out

421
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,120
right so just having that

422
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,830
middle-ground security awareness program

423
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,280
we're kind of we're missing the mark

424
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,410
there's no transparency oftentimes when

425
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,420
it comes to security one of the biggest

426
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,780
things that I tried to implement duo was

427
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,710
making sure that we were very

428
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,210
transparent with our users when it came

429
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,460
to letting them know about the things

430
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,440
that are happening in the news it's very

431
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
important that you get out in front of

432
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,340
them and let them know the things that

433
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,260
they should be aware of the things that

434
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,150
they should be looking for how does this

435
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,890
relate to their personal lives because

436
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,869
at the end of the day that's what they

437
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,210
care about how they protect their

438
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,440
personal lives fear-based approach again

439
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,510
we talked about that that's not a

440
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,280
successful way to run a security

441
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,440
awareness program and then reusing the

442
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,800
same tactics so for those of you that

443
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,540
have run phishing awareness programs in

444
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,760
the past how many of you guys have

445
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,500
gotten emails from your users after you

446
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,320
sent one saying ho ho I found the

447
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,390
information in the header I know what to

448
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,010
look for this is from dead or dead uh

449
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,440
you know and they start expecting it

450
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,960
around the same time of year the same

451
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,730
campaign to run over and over and over

452
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,050
again so that's why we're getting that

453
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,030
really low click right right it's not

454
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,990
effective it's really not effective

455
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,370
they're getting really good at spotting

456
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,820
those fake messages now attackers for

457
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,800
those of you that are red teamers or

458
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,110
that have have kind of dealt with those

459
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,080
those people what they're doing is

460
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,400
they're doing a little bit more recon

461
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,560
when they're actually sending it as a

462
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,410
message right so one of the things that

463
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,770
I did at do almost recently was one of

464
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,060
our fishing campaigns that we sent out

465
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,800
we actually use the data that we were

466
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,970
finding on Twitter to target a phishing

467
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,730
campaign to our employees so we had a

468
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,330
big hack day at the company and we were

469
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,730
like just trawling Twitter and all

470
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,230
sudden we see all these posts of people

471
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,880
that are like heck did do Oh

472
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,040
everything's great Buffalo LA and I

473
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,320
started thinking hmm I wonder how many

474
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,700
other people are watching this photo

475
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,860
recount right now that now know all of

476
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,390
our employees are engaged in something

477
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,750
that's not general work activities their

478
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,610
guards probably down there security team

479
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,110
is probably not participating the things

480
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,300
that they don't they generally do it

481
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,440
became a really

482
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,639
really really effective phishing

483
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,590
campaign we got a lot of people with

484
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,799
that it wasn't just the standard hey

485
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,740
your credit card has been charged or X

486
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,960
number of dollars or or that here's your

487
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,570
flight itinerary most employees that

488
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,129
companies don't travel so they're not

489
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,639
gonna fall for something like that

490
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,509
highlighting security education only

491
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:16,929
once per year so depressing we should be

492
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,190
talking about security all the time we

493
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,600
should finally student integrate it into

494
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,779
our users in our users faces more than

495
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,340
once per year because like I said you

496
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,480
have that employee that starts on

497
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,029
November 2nd and they've never had

498
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,409
security awareness training guess what

499
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,309
they're clicking on and they're really

500
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:35,490
alright so is our program successful

501
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,929
what are some ways that you guys are

502
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:42,460
currently looking at your data and able

503
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,350
to determine whether or not it's your

504
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,960
secure employees our security aware what

505
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,740
are some things that you guys are doing

506
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,330
anything besides the click right

507
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,760
okay so basically looking at the traffic

508
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,260
on their machines to see you like what

509
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,690
types of things are accessing what types

510
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,120
of callbacks are being made so yeah so

511
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,039
that would definitely be be one thing

512
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,610
that you could look for absolutely yes

513
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,070
yes there is so much valuable

514
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,620
information in the information that is

515
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,750
reported to the security team or not

516
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,240
reported to the security team I know

517
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,070
it's very annoying every time then an

518
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,500
employee messages you like hey this

519
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,639
looks fishy and it's just like a

520
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:32,340
marketing email I know it's annoying but

521
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,200
that means a lot that means that they

522
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,210
are being watchful and they're looking

523
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,450
for the things that just aren't right

524
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,309
and they're sending them off to security

525
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,250
always always always always nurture that

526
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,350
behavior send an email back let them

527
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,940
know hey yep this one happens to be a

528
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,919
marketing email but thanks for being

529
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
vigilant it means a lot and it helps to

530
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,559
continue that behavior

531
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,330
alright so currently we're looking at

532
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,059
things like are people taking our online

533
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,700
training modules most of the time if

534
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,750
they're mandatory then yet they're

535
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,789
absolutely going to take them the number

536
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:06,990
of employees that are attending your

537
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,779
trainings yeah that can be a pretty

538
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,820
pretty good indicator of success of your

539
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,799
awareness program but if it's a mandated

540
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,929
presentation they're gonna be there

541
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,600
anyway right the click rate um yep on

542
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,419
that fishing test does not mean anything

543
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,610
guys it really doesn't show us that much

544
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,480
and oh we haven't been breached that

545
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,230
that that that you know love so yeah

546
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,820
sometimes that could be a really good

547
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,260
indicator that our employees are our

548
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,380
security aware but how do we know for

549
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,620
getting it right how do we actually know

550
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,870
if these programs if the money that

551
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,970
we're draining into these programs which

552
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,950
are expensive when we're talking like

553
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,639
fifteen plus dollars a month per user

554
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,049
for an individual license I mean the

555
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,909
licensing fees are crazy and then the

556
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,110
amount of time that you're investing in

557
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,240
actually building that program no hidden

558
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,919
that's probably taking up a lot of your

559
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,889
time specifically and you want to make

560
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,299
sure that it's successful you want to

561
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,789
make sure that you're hitting the mark

562
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:07,669
so we're gonna start with the basics

563
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,320
when I built duo security awareness

564
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,220
program

565
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,290
one of the things that I I talked about

566
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,780
now every new higher class sat through a

567
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,760
presentation with me day one and we

568
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,250
talked about the five basics which are

569
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,840
listed here so updating your devices

570
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,400
using strong passwords using unique

571
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,890
passwords using a password manager and

572
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,860
using two-factor authentication now for

573
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,920
a lot of people this might seem like

574
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,040
common knowledge but it's amazing how

575
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,170
many people aren't doing just these very

576
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,140
basic things now if we talk again about

577
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,850
the high level user and the low level

578
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,560
user if we're just staying right in that

579
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,200
middle area we're missing things right

580
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,970
so we want to take them right down to

581
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,140
the basics and make sure that they're

582
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,790
doing at least these five fundamental

583
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,350
things and at the end of the day what I

584
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,880
want to do is make sure that I'm

585
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,450
relating it to them personally

586
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,890
everything that I talk about especially

587
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,650
in that day one presentation I want to

588
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,150
make sure that they're taking something

589
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,260
out of that and going home with it and

590
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,610
to do that we want to relate it to them

591
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,950
personally by letting them know what can

592
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,740
happen to their personal devices if

593
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,890
they're not updating because at the end

594
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,880
of the day that's what they care about

595
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,690
right and we should hopefully all have

596
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,890
regulations and policies and things like

597
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,630
that in place at work that help to make

598
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,370
sure that we're actually updating our

599
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,960
devices that they're using strong

600
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,580
passwords but we can't protect them at

601
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,470
home so we want to make sure that that

602
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,420
security mindset goes home with them

603
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,470
because how often do breaches occur

604
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,240
because of things that people are doing

605
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,250
their personal lives right it's a lot of

606
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,930
a lot of loss to a company can happen

607
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,390
from that so we don't want to relate it

608
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,420
just to a policy employees don't really

609
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,430
care about policies you give them their

610
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,820
code of conduct to read they don't they

611
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,710
just they just sign it move on right we

612
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,240
don't know that hell I don't read it

613
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,220
alright so how can we improve this what

614
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,080
can we do to improve our security

615
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,340
awareness program yes we're not perfect

616
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,050
I love this dog it's so cute alright so

617
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,600
we want to educate everyone enough with

618
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,740
those special snowflakes

619
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,150
everybody gets security awareness

620
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,270
training at some level we need to

621
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,760
specialize the training as well

622
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,980
developers people that are more aware of

623
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,960
security they still need training but we

624
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,270
need to specialize it to them another

625
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,560
thing that's really important is if you

626
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,260
take a look at your organization and you

627
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,410
break down each specific job or each

628
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,220
specific departments duties how many of

629
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,230
you guys have like call centers where

630
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,250
you work out okay is anyone doing actual

631
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,840
like training with them on like social

632
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,230
engineering if we break down the

633
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,910
specific departments and we look at the

634
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,130
things that actually can target them or

635
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,170
the things that they're vulnerable to we

636
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,820
can create those trainings that actually

637
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,250
matter to them which is very important

638
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,490
we want to switch it up yeah phishing

639
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,900
campaigns are great they give us a good

640
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,320
really nice hard number for a metric but

641
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
there's other things we can do to us be

642
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,550
drops like there's so many things that

643
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,890
we can do different trainings you know

644
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,010
one of the best things that you can do

645
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,380
set out locks invite people to come pick

646
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,830
locks

647
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,870
it's amazing the questions that you get

648
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,880
during that interaction because their

649
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,560
guards down it's not a room like this

650
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,210
where you're talking at somebody for

651
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,820
4050 minutes their guards down they'll

652
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,050
ask you more of those questions that

653
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,180
actually matter to them and that helps

654
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,800
to also build more content into your

655
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,350
security awareness programs transparency

656
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,080
share real examples

657
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,640
following that phishing campaign that we

658
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,460
sent out from from the Twitter account

659
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,770
the data that we found on Twitter we let

660
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,080
everybody know that that was how we came

661
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,700
up with that campaign sharing those real

662
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,580
examples obviously if you find something

663
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,870
that could potentially there is someone

664
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,980
or something like that we don't want to

665
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,450
do anything like that

666
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,220
generalize it but share those real

667
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,230
stories it's really really important so

668
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,340
that people can relate it back to

669
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,760
themselves

670
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,440
absolutely so Hayden said that he likes

671
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,700
to tell people that he personally has

672
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,670
been fished honestly I probably have

673
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,500
been too I mean I'm sure a lot of us

674
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,940
have even like before we got into the

675
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,230
industry and things like that

676
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,210
it's very easy to fall for that kind of

677
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,280
stuff and one of the other really

678
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,780
important things is to be an ally to

679
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,390
these people to your employees make sure

680
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,160
that they know that they can come to you

681
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,940
with those questions knowing what's

682
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,290
important to your employees again

683
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,060
setting off those locks and having them

684
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,780
come and have just a general

685
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,130
conversation with you is something

686
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,840
that's going to help you to understand

687
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,670
their concerns in their department the

688
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,410
things that worry them at home and then

689
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,940
you can help to kind of address those

690
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,960
types of things and nurture curiosity

691
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,890
curiosity is great right it doesn't

692
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,630
always kill the cat sometimes it does

693
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,720
but it's very important to nourish or

694
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
you have to nourish that curiosity

695
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,670
that's that's it in our employees and

696
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,000
then encourage and reward good behavior

697
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,530
sending a simple email letting you know

698
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,940
that something seems suspicious reward

699
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,660
that person if if you have a team slack

700
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,890
channel or something like that

701
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,780
give them Karma send them a shout-out

702
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,370
let them know let everybody in the

703
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,840
company know hey this person just

704
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,550
identified this even though it wasn't

705
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,340
even something that was legitimate we're

706
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,420
really thankful that they were vigilant

707
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,560
and that they sent this to us

708
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,050
it's really important so one of the big

709
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,960
things that I do especially for the

710
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,080
onboarding class is immediately

711
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
following well about an hour after their

712
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,890
initial onboarding class where we talk a

713
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,240
lot about phishing and the dangers and

714
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,870
things like that

715
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,430
I give him about an hour to forget

716
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,070
everything I talked about probably takes

717
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,410
like 20 minutes and I fish them

718
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,720
immediately click rates are high but

719
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,810
guess what that one fish that they have

720
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,780
just been exposed to on day one sparks a

721
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,250
little bit of paranoia they never open

722
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,080
two emails for me again and you know one

723
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,270
of those things which is fine totally

724
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:20,150
fine but seeing that on day one helps

725
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,130
them to be a little bit more concerned

726
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,140
about the types of things that they

727
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,330
could potentially get in their email

728
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,550
inbox now if you have a new hire

729
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,420
that starts mm-hmm you wait ten months

730
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,010
to get them any type of really security

731
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,930
awareness training they could

732
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,100
potentially click on a phishing email

733
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,310
and then what you know that's a problem

734
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,970
so day two of their own boarding we

735
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,680
always revisit them go through kind of a

736
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,120
refresher talk about other things that

737
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,950
they probably forgot and what we do is

738
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,450
we create a really safe environment for

739
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,880
them to talk about why they either

740
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
clicked or why they did not click on

741
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,510
that fish the things that they might

742
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,950
have seen had they looked a little

743
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,020
closer and then just to kind of start

744
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,340
like nourishing that relationship

745
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,980
between us and the in the new employees

746
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,390
so that they know it's safe to come and

747
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,310
talk to us about the things that even

748
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,780
though some of them might have messed up

749
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,760
it's okay you can still come talk to us

750
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,440
we want those things reported it's very

751
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,440
important all right so then another

752
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,330
thing that I like to talk about is being

753
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,850
proactive versus reactive so if you

754
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,170
think about this again is kind of like

755
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,940
organic versus mandated any of you have

756
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,800
the unfortunate experience of ever being

757
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,320
like robbed or having things stolen from

758
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,750
you or anything like that terrible

759
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,450
feeling right one conversation that I

760
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,160
had with someone recently they said well

761
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,810
yeah I install the security system in my

762
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,010
house after I got broken into so you're

763
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,600
being reactive you're taking a reactive

764
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,670
measure when potentially if you were

765
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,050
proactive and you had installed that

766
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,430
security system that may have not

767
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,770
happened right so those are the types of

768
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,960
things that you can easily relate back

769
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,670
to to your employees to help it hit home

770
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,580
make it that real in that graphic

771
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,810
because those are the things that they

772
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,700
care about they care about safety they

773
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,680
care about their families relate that

774
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,020
back in a way that makes them want to be

775
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,430
more secure with computers as well it's

776
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,490
my favorite slide I want you all to be

777
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,200
criminals be criminals every time that I

778
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,570
I put this in a slide especially for for

779
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,310
a security awareness training and I

780
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,190
encourage engaging a criminal mindset I

781
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,950
get the weirdest looks especially from

782
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,590
like the CEOs at the company it's weird

783
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,020
they don't generally like that but it's

784
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,190
very important that if we're all

785
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,550
thinking like criminals we're thinking

786
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,520
about those attacker

787
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,000
we're thinking like them it makes it a

788
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
lot easier to identify the things that

789
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,260
are wrong so one of the things that I

790
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,550
like to talk about is like if you see

791
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,960
someone's badge laying around pick it up

792
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,429
and turn it in because if that gets into

793
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:54,870
the wrong person's hands think about all

794
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,309
the damage that could be done getting

795
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:58,020
rooms that potentially they shouldn't

796
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,059
things like that so engaging a criminal

797
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,720
mindset can really help to make it so

798
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,550
your users are looking for the things

799
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,340
that they should be looking for all

800
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,750
right so now we're going to talk a

801
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,280
little bit about where we should be

802
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,860
looking as I mentioned earlier reports

803
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,920
from your employees have so much

804
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,380
valuable information it lets you know

805
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,929
the things that are suspicious to them

806
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:23,550
and the things that they're seeing on a

807
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,670
daily basis and by encouraging that

808
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,650
reporting behavior you get a lot of

809
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,510
really great information out of this and

810
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,980
if you're not getting a lot of these

811
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,500
reports then you potentially need to

812
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,960
encourage more reporting employee

813
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,540
behaviors one of my favorite things that

814
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,280
I've ever seen in a company there's a

815
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,870
random person walking around an office

816
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,929
taking pictures they were there for a

817
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,690
legitimate reason but one of the people

818
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,030
in the area stood up and was like excuse

819
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,679
me why are you taking pictures I was

820
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,950
like yes walked over I was like yes this

821
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,010
is great that isn't a that is a really

822
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,170
really important behavior if everyone

823
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,670
just kind of looked around and watched

824
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,200
this person taking pictures or like a

825
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,670
random stranger walking around the

826
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,140
office that they didn't identify and

827
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,440
they're just like okay that's weird that

828
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
person is weird and didn't say anything

829
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
then they're not being very secure eight

830
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,040
aware so that's definitely another thing

831
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,230
that we can look at and our tools are so

832
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,350
valuable it's absolutely amazing when

833
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,700
you take a look at the tools that you're

834
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,380
using on a daily basis how many of you

835
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,660
guys are using using slash mandating of

836
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,780
like a password manager at work like

837
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,790
Enterprise okay so let's let's talk

838
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,150
about last mats for instance they have

839
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,730
an enterprise version that allows you to

840
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,410
see a lot of really valuable data about

841
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,050
your employees how many passwords are in

842
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,870
there in their vault different things

843
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,290
like that

844
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,929
that'll let you know based on how many

845
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,880
user accounts they have how many things

846
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,140
are actually stored in there in

847
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,150
well if they're reusing passwords all

848
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,950
that stuff is really really valuable to

849
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,080
us as analysts updating devices the rate

850
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,430
at which your employees are actually

851
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,880
updating devices is very very helpful to

852
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,230
let you know whether or not their

853
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,660
security aware if they know that as soon

854
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,400
as that security update comes out they

855
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,730
need to be updating it and they do it

856
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,320
that says a lot for your security

857
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,530
culture at your company if that notice

858
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,210
comes out you know it's hey it's been 14

859
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,950
days since the update and you still

860
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,030
haven't updated and then they're being

861
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,710
forced and mandated to update it you

862
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,360
know that they're not taking that part

863
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,750
seriously using strong and unique

864
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,310
passwords again talking about like

865
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,960
LastPass or a password manager often

866
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,280
times with the enterprise versions we

867
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
can see a lot of really great data in

868
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
there about whether or not people are

869
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,990
actually using strong and unique

870
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,770
passwords and oftentimes if they're

871
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,870
practicing that good behavior at work it

872
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,670
will bleed over into their real lives as

873
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,930
well especially if we make these things

874
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,870
very small and manageable using the

875
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,360
password manager again great information

876
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,490
there for us he is and then two-factor

877
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,770
authentication whatever that is right

878
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,270
yeah no no big deal I just worked for

879
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,790
duo so yeah two-factor authentication

880
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,230
how many of you guys actually use duo

881
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,429
it's a lot of you that's great

882
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,040
all right so duo any of you guys have

883
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,399
like that the admin panel access there's

884
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,960
so much really great information

885
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,020
available in there that lets you know

886
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,850
how your users are authenticating and

887
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,040
like how they're how they're to

888
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,360
factoring so whether it be with a duo

889
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,010
push or like Yubikey or something like

890
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,600
that that information can be very

891
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,429
valuable another really great thing that

892
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,659
you can get out of that is whether or

893
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,280
not they're checking the remember my

894
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,080
password for 30 days and that's

895
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,880
something that we can look at to to see

896
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,989
whether or not they're thinking about

897
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,090
the fact that the sites that they're

898
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,830
using remember my password for 30 days

899
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,540
on is that is that really good behavior

900
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,580
all right so that's pretty much the end

901
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,940
for me I love this case so stupid and

902
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,850
funny so yeah any questions from you

903
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,650
guys

904
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,500
Georgie I wouldn't eat up the whole time

905
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,750
any question yeah

906
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,380
so that's a really good question so

907
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,210
talking about like actually rotating

908
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,470
your passwords and things like that

909
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,870
that is actually something that I

910
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,010
personally don't tell users to rotate

911
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,050
their passwords unless they know or

912
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,520
suspect that it's been breached

913
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
because oftentimes what you find is if

914
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,060
you're setting a strong password and

915
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,410
then you're encouraging them to change

916
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,200
it like every 90 days they're changing

917
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,850
like a number at the end and I know

918
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,090
that's what I used to do yeah exactly so

919
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,170
so many of us are doing that because

920
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,090
it's just like it becomes this monotony

921
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,320
of rotating your password and things

922
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,400
like that so kind of getting away from

923
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,050
that and just encouraging the use of a

924
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,730
very strong password and maybe saying

925
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,820
hey only remember your computer password

926
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,430
your email password and your password -

927
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,310
your your fault everything else as many

928
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,540
characters as possible start in your

929
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,250
vault that type of thing can really help

930
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,870
to encourage really strong security

931
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:12,160
behavior any other questions yeah

932
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,740
oh yeah definitely so so the question

933
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,990
was have I seen any adversaries in the

934
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,490
wild who are actually like trolling

935
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,720
Twitter and things like that and

936
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,800
actually using those for phishing

937
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,680
campaigns absolutely I've also worked

938
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,350
with like external contractors and third

939
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,760
parties and things like that that have

940
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,060
done that to create their campaigns to

941
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,100
attack the company which is very very

942
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,860
very very successful and effective
