1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:15,419
wife is Gary Beck don't trust her that's
all you gotta watch out for more than 12

2
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:25,420
suits you all know that and suspend

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:49,550
yes I know who buys this is psychology
that's been studied a lot of people and

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,890
I have several videos to show you to
find some of the points that will be

5
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,120
talked about now a lot of times people
look at me go what the psychology have

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,530
to do with computers well everything
because we still have humans connected

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,690
to the computer for the time being

8
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:20,539
yes last week and so the problem is we
are the proud of what we've been looking

9
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,390
at places so I'm also so I think it's ok
it's what we do

10
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:35,110
also have about nine classified labs are
mine

11
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:43,390
company and so heavily involved
classified world I won't be giving you

12
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:57,380
that this way with counterintelligence
don't wanna know not what you say you

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:18,320
don't want to know so what we gonna do
this your brain is how your brain works

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:46,579
what does tricks does this helps us
making this all the hacker size you want

15
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:52,770
to know what those mistakes

16
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,140
the defensive side is really need to
know so that when you're developing

17
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:10,779
security you know how to correct and how
do procedures and protocols to help in

18
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,720
this situation so my question is does
your brain lied to you does it feel to

19
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,950
reality a hundred different way

20
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,440
518

21
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:45,490
implies failure that vaccinations or
something because you're doing ok we'll

22
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:54,470
talk about that little bit of research
to support she ate you will know or

23
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,660
everybody on this room who have facts
and statistics to prove that you're

24
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,380
wrong you won't believe so ingrained
into

25
00:04:06,380 --> 00:16:42,920
volunteer one moment here to watch the
screen ok ok not the world

26
00:16:42,920 --> 00:20:30,440
when the polls

27
00:20:30,440 --> 00:21:15,419
six times for three times to times when
he tried this with human subjects Jason

28
00:21:15,419 --> 00:22:05,360
averaged 12 times three times for 5-6
times a year on average about 325 people

29
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:25,379
give you reason why don't you completely
different team when you eat five times

30
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:34,620
more times three times when you have to
do a problem quickly you don't really

31
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,129
high

32
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:49,650
you through the first members you
multiply it by six and be like ed 2000

33
00:22:49,650 --> 00:23:13,110
or so we need 1-2 times recently 600 or
so the first thing he asked me well we

34
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:27,020
should just not just need to be really
strong in the first problem even bigger

35
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:44,480
number from here just a different artist
to be harnessed to get with her

36
00:23:44,480 --> 00:24:02,740
husband's phone numbers from 100
countries in the united nations

37
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:20,210
number was about 25 percent but he did
people bring out the last two digits he

38
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:27,879
wouldn't have $20 per 91 people in the
highest quintile

39
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:52,289
with so much for being willing to spend
$27 each particular reading how much

40
00:24:52,289 --> 00:26:11,309
food prices are too high and then you
might expect

41
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:39,269
directions to people carry and/or
bounced between them and the first

42
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:53,430
experiment is replaced by someone else

43
00:26:53,430 --> 00:27:29,220
talking to a different person was
replaced by someone else I know that's

44
00:27:29,220 --> 00:29:51,510
how you get away with ricky is still a
friend of mine

45
00:29:51,510 --> 00:30:27,100
so

46
00:30:27,100 --> 00:31:55,939
what do you think that's perfectly fine

47
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:49,899
same thing happens in security you see
before they tried working right now and

48
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,428
dad coming days

49
00:32:52,429 --> 00:33:18,630
medium-sized

50
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:40,240
we choose what we think will give us the
greatest emphasis but what movies they

51
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,070
seem trivial external contextual factors
to demonstrate one such factor we're

52
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,570
analyzing experiment were invited to
participate in the short to experiment

53
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,710
on decision making it to the carnival
style with a ball throwing desk

54
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:04,230
volunteers had to try it through a
jungle into a meter distance to the ice

55
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,510
them to participate we offer to children
to school

56
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,899
beholden to they couldn't find the store
was a dominant hand at 11 children or

57
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:20,489
thrown into your computers in economic
terms we presented our volunteers with a

58
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:30,638
choice between a low risk high risk high
reward but here's the twist we randomly

59
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:39,090
divided into two groups presented with a
low risk no reward options

60
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:47,540
high-risk high-reward destruction the
short field that participants before

61
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,399
entering this royal once the
participants had to become of wall with

62
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,710
their dominant

63
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,080
to take their toll

64
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,029
they were given the final trip D with
whatever the default option Wallace or

65
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:12,980
switch to these people would make their
decision based purely on risk and reward

66
00:35:12,980 --> 00:36:11,079
or wavy options were presented were
framed would have a legacy

67
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:19,519
decided which is based purely on trade
off between risk and reward we would

68
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:28,379
expect that the honeymooners low-risk
auctions will be chosen 191 people

69
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:36,650
participated to talk 98 people walked in
with the ball in their dominance and did

70
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,279
not choose to switch

71
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:45,999
93 people who want to do with the ball
in there and the majority 62%

72
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:54,819
did not switch so what happened with
whatever the default this is known as

73
00:36:54,819 --> 00:37:05,279
the status quo he said he'll take the
current position and you decide to throw

74
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:11,309
in their own internal no deterrent
instead they decided whether to give up

75
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:22,609
unity change from comida psychology
about people seeing losses and gains

76
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:28,440
different potential loss associated with
the default position was perceived as

77
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:42,739
greater than the potential gains tax and
insurance providers to their choices are

78
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:49,089
presented to people including the
options which are more decisions people

79
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:55,819
make a real world example bias is home
auctions concerning organ donation organ

80
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:59,288
donors presented as the default

81
00:37:59,289 --> 00:39:24,210
influences

82
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:45,790
in social psychology

83
00:39:45,790 --> 00:40:03,800
the car

84
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:15,780
happens many different situations in the
workplace relationships and even with

85
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,640
the shop

86
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,250
researchers and helps protect their
self-esteem

87
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:30,220
motions we can't control their role in
the evening use it to protect others

88
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:39,140
like we say it wasn't your fault there's
nothing you could have done have a great

89
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,098
impact on my life because we learn from
our mistakes and he just something for

90
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,980
years without getting there

91
00:40:47,980 --> 00:41:04,610
she had asked me harder for you

92
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:12,080
so here are some point you started by
inserting yourself and notice when

93
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,009
you're doing it

94
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:29,609
to imagine how you know what happens if
you lose

95
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:37,089
the problems too much trying to solve
them when we dwell on the past our mind

96
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:42,420
excuses which starts to self-serving
bias

97
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,970
everybody but only the people who
understand
