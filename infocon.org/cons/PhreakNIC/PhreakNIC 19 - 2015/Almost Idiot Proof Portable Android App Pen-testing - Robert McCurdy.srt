1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:09,580
Portland whatever crisis about a year
ago and try to roll my own this work

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,570
with the idea is to have it work with
james also growing my own who ran into

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:23,448
our mornings 86 and ability issues and
I'll go over there but then how does

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:32,009
comedy so we're gonna do question what
game does the little interrelate

5
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:45,870
remind you of here

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:01:00,209
is like a barely a magical unicorn kinda
still people myself included in some

7
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,070
cases and we have the following type of
bike good and we have this new art which

8
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,770
I have improved at you

9
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,670
burned lollipop platform so kind of the
bike around you simply language but for

10
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:24,390
the Android device so that complicates
things cuz they also have the issue of

11
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,810
the application itself trying to do
everything over SSL and sometimes you

12
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,300
can travel easily and requires and
shenanigans in the middle of the action

13
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,440
going on there

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,460
pieces on the device actually had access
to to be able to do these double post

15
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,910
sorry only cost you know you want to buy
the latest and greatest I who live but

16
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,369
Liz greatest Android device and it's
going to cost a fair amount of money

17
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:05,230
strategy and architecture is that that
feeds the actual

18
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:17,860
the emulation soviet and later go or so
and some examples of you need to work

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,300
early the tax

20
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:29,630
ocean with these jelly beans are beings
really that piece of crap is that is all

21
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:40,440
garbage can install its better but I'm
not sure yet so don't ever install is

22
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:50,820
Dax another video as an early dinner and
evaluation of crap so what's the

23
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,420
difference between

24
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:05,970
slowly but if you wanna do something for
everyone

25
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,660
differences once we crossed over from
peek at it broke all my because it's an

26
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:27,300
architecture so whether the stuff that's
when I really don't want to use and the

27
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,910
stairs to create easy to use portable
drives about six months to a year ago

28
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:43,170
and read all these roadblocks was built
from anonymous and try to get your place

29
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,829
thought you did

30
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:56,410
so that's kind of hard when using this
thing which I don't know there's

31
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,970
stimulating the ARM architecture inside
of your computer and that's relatively

32
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:11,940
slow and there's actually speed for the
indie platformer over x86 private

33
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:22,590
experience but if you talk this out of
the box says that they wanted to be

34
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:30,479
simple you know all you gotta do is have
a box is when do I was gonna go until it

35
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:39,390
could also include common are common
applications that you needed more than

36
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:59,870
ever just kind of around 105 have won by
11 issue but you know I'm not a manager

37
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:11,419
I don't need a phone call people with
that is that I mean really great so you

38
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,330
know that the common tool said I want to
have in their dog my head I don't do

39
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:29,039
their stuff which tells the Play Store
and other Google

40
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,880
Google Apps when you were going to
Israel the idea of being as for

41
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,350
compatibility issues over to support a
giant you know huge you know the true

42
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:52,140
giant displayed that I can only do this
is my engines of holographic so no prob

43
00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:00,789
still kind of weird there's extra G else
some of these softwares the texts of

44
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:12,800
somehow they look into me video games
were better figure it all out

45
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:43,590
has the most cell phones on them more
than

46
00:06:43,590 --> 00:07:49,900
so there is a wonderful news games that
make enough money like this you guys

47
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:57,400
they were thrown protocol it's like not
as well as I don't even know the game

48
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,780
works that has you know versus is where
the premium garbage you didn't

49
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:27,919
so fun and interesting in there once
you've got a really kind of you know

50
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,909
more complicated so I don't understand
all myself so the only western region

51
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:47,819
and ask something basic together but for
hours these two recently released this

52
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,720
is called it's not a player is awesome

53
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,200
includes tax except it's not violent
garbage it seems to not be on a server

54
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,210
is not doing anything it shouldn't be
doing it does home

55
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:10,630
consuming predictability is used so the
idea being that possibly the absolute

56
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,040
they're not sabse pehle competitive
there's a patch for something to happen

57
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,930
they know will break Knox will bring
some functionality that you lose that

58
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:28,599
users so I have not evaluated the
software so we have to prove it's based

59
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:40,620
on VMware from McGill sorry this number
12 bucks so comes with 550 make it comes

60
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,880
with two discs and they're kind of how
it works through where or who saw these

61
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:55,430
deals with the nice creates is loaded up

62
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:09,479
VirtualBox these not yet so you have
free access so I'm still here so I'm

63
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:27,279
gonna restart restart this great little
but only trying to lock it down so they

64
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:36,820
can't believe the boundary boot it
disappears but a lot of the day they

65
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:47,680
won't give you don't want you open the
box special Knox underscore adisq which

66
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,250
somehow hopes something different than
the normally be fun and games work in 10

67
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,089
games of these the ones I so I was free
to prove its good you know everything

68
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:10,300
you would want more tax so enjoy it
seems to originate from trying to go to

69
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,719
new to the market and there's not a
whole research into what the company is

70
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,560
what it do with his cell there's no Tony
but there's no buy button is exists as

71
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,378
Rousseau something free good that the
trial has been so something's going on

72
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,689
so they might put a pricing model later
was I don't deal with the idea there is

73
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:59,319
a process as even a question your
browser basically what kind of car radio

74
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:18,878
news really replace the one milliliter
CD-roms

75
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:34,559
responsibly was improved their something
people still has he drowns in 2012 I do

76
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:42,139
have in our own version for bill that I
do but it's really slow and it does so

77
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:50,229
because she's not really open even if it
was raining it's really slow so we ended

78
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:58,279
up with is not for example these reasons
for now these so this year is 64 bit

79
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:07,789
until only so far lease has a built-in
job of which sits on the path to install

80
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:08,310
a job

81
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:20,349
jour built in there and then sorry
activated Google account so you don't

82
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,620
have to do we need a vacation anything
to turn on the beginning and now I'm

83
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:32,060
sorry you can do it going so this is
total screenshots you're the first one

84
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:43,849
is certain starter joy of trying to
install Android or the device can be

85
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:55,990
going on so this morning for in one of
these mixed breed it's from the URL of

86
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:02,690
your proxy server in this case and then
you put the board and I D which in this

87
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:09,029
case is all net it for whatever reason
not says three interviews one of which

88
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,189
is this

89
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,089
022 round interviews so sweet to go to
this address which is the host machine

90
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:35,980
is running a net three cars for whatever
reason so few 430 this is actually looks

91
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:46,920
a 2002 and won again

92
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:58,550
basis and I just did my actual interface
reverse sweep the marks will I just used

93
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:08,099
for the hosts in a way that works you
guys so that's the biggest sport for all

94
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:15,120
this BS is across the board when you
click the Install that ensures that

95
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,690
everything is going to burst mean you're
getting this is also getting at least

96
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:53,769
most of assault epic and everything use
this is supposed to

97
00:15:53,769 --> 00:16:20,049
the rising death is now so that we can
ensure that the Knights player can talk

98
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:29,059
to the host machines or whatever price
you sure that the traffic from the good

99
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:38,600
and yours a screenshot of proxies really
wish once you have installed procedure

100
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:54,540
will automate the process basically said
he enjoyed it will who makes use IP

101
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,879
decide that for all the traffic through
super sweet and you can also do you

102
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:14,599
juggle DNS proxy remaining means that
those who are in the big TV is generally

103
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:28,789
however and then hopefully it doesn't I
don't be confused cuz interceptor paws

104
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:36,450
need West descend through proxy so he's
started inside

105
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:47,370
you realize that you have turned on the
specific people on this number so we can

106
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:55,870
make sure you can see GDP and he's GPS
so be returned on drugs enjoy it you

107
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:03,418
know that something's going on the haps
doing like as a self-pitying or

108
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:13,330
something like that

109
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:28,010
for fun that party backed up

110
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:40,460
good then explore for the UK and also
you are in there around out there really

111
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:49,550
value added one which really get to do
what I want to do but the new ones for

112
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:58,899
his beating traffic was never exposed
framework which allows when I just

113
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:09,170
became an education life so do your legs
go in jeans line do whatever possible to

114
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:15,420
find this when you go to this
instruction doing without having to

115
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,870
actually modified originally became so
they have tens of billions for all kinds

116
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,340
of different applications like you to
think there's all kinds of fun stuff in

117
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:37,600
there then we have your sensual but for
the Cubs so if you're anywhere in

118
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,280
application and you see you value that
modify it and wait for the game to crash

119
00:19:43,280 --> 00:20:09,480
into throughout you so so so China
applications where he needed to get

120
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:20,630
setup but I'll Roland you doing here
some stuff

121
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:31,630
anybody's

122
00:20:31,630 --> 00:21:30,880
patterns since

123
00:21:30,880 --> 00:23:00,150
so

124
00:23:00,150 --> 00:24:18,180
open else all kinds of security risks so
did basis this is these explore and

125
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,760
we're going to go

126
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:36,030
which had all this payments built into
it so we going to do business structure

127
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:44,240
of most recent voter where most of the
time it's only it's usually like the ad

128
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:52,290
where where he got his who you are

129
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:58,700
applications that you do location and as
opposed to being with when you're inside

130
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:06,070
where it is but depending on the level
occasion even though global application

131
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,040
knows that is outside of where the
message is for the barber

132
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:20,360
whatever it still is the home and said
this is where the person is bad people

133
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,280
while they're on site

134
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:34,590
packages or whatever why are you still
do to win so it's the whole week there

135
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:42,490
anything and everything is deleted and
stuff so we have databases border here

136
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:51,320
in the GDP has some interesting david
vendetta vs herein

137
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:04,149
so the way the older version the newer
version of Adobe to get this type of the

138
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:13,820
only reason here this is what we were
just too big but she's in Vancouver and

139
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:24,340
whatever all these are just so you had
whenever the code is looking through the

140
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:44,709
or just look around and said 10 and go
as you know we don't really see you

141
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:54,500
drive your networks I just in case work
in the news that work and home

142
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:10,960
who attack or some other crew for
applications is lucky patcher and

143
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,780
looking better and you can open up new
batches and you can do custom patches

144
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,660
removing the default Google Ads hope so
you're ready application to use the

145
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:32,020
Google AdSense framework for your dad do
things like that and say oh the better

146
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:47,550
this is just so you know it's dad's we
have been here know in most cases have

147
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:58,010
been happy news example of the very
things every single play games and stuff

148
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:09,920
generally doesn't work because they use
their own code you know they're actually

149
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:32,610
the same so back to the apt stuff that
will usually just crashed you have the

150
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:52,100
obligation has access to the kind of the
Lady Vols information stole some of them

151
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:59,120
you can call it was the color coding is
there like custom built in interest once

152
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,080
but generally speaking the ideas the
idea was to play baseball and there's a

153
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:15,840
lot of stuff that just doing privacy
rights just crashes but the ideal is to

154
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,120
go in there was the village pool they
going to decompile it whenever the code

155
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,250
is

156
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:33,460
the rural studio

157
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,790
it makes it all but if you put your
phone and you like whatever you want to

158
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,480
call them skins and searched when you're
done

159
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:58,680
who came back to the phone so let's
revisit set up doubles one game so I was

160
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:19,440
a house you'd be surprised even just
doing OK and searching for easy TV so

161
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,170
easy be like it will show you what
information is for the Yankees in six

162
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,650
all the way

163
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,540
like dot com or ETP yossi surprising
amount of like I didn't envision

164
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:44,440
information going across aware of what
you want which is what had you so we got

165
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,400
some traffic from here and this is
essentially one of those you can only

166
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:58,710
play the game so much for a day then
it's got to be

167
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:09,330
spins you so the person is ready to give
myself a limited so he's been using

168
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:19,030
Google enemies to you and i couldnt
unsound

169
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:30,100
imposed a magical it's basically women
at the end of the day unless this guy

170
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,969
doesn't protocol into it a lot of the
stuff is Jesus are accidental or just

171
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:43,500
the simple both requests so you're
reluctant we access the

172
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:53,240
with this unique number which they they
fix this there's a fire the snow and

173
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,830
then we have been spinning the wheel and
then this is like an occasion for all

174
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,409
your idea so I click the spinning wheel
and we got a response back from the

175
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:15,740
server with a lot of the stuff is good
it's also so is also amazing ability

176
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,330
within a game where navigation these
guys will essentially snapshot your

177
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,070
profile and anybody else involved with
the vulnerability and snapshot it back

178
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,060
to where you were edward has been you
straight out so we have all the

179
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:39,010
information about you know we have a are
ready to make some people who live here

180
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:45,920
but the important ones are things will
change his Benz 49 back to see what

181
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,220
happens known as we're done is getting a
lot of these variables their own service

182
00:32:50,220 --> 00:33:00,300
so we tried a program with great ideas
you replay attacks

183
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:13,399
pins and see if you can get something
games

184
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,090
this is the very thing that came out
years ago and this is one there was no

185
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:32,750
service so that's the breeding and game
and you go around you could be fun for

186
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:39,900
about a week and it ended up being
decommissioned jess and I said I was

187
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,510
trying to replay their request

188
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:52,650
reads try to replay that you begin to
get the treasure chest went straight no

189
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:04,550
idea whatever was a 2012 know it was a
track one BB no not enough so that the

190
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,040
posts

191
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,230
not realizing what I was looking at a
look at the request and every time you

192
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:21,090
do anything to the game the servers back
so that the phone at D whatever your

193
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:38,550
stats were so I went in to replace
anything of value assigned to it as the

194
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:44,550
gyms or whatever so I was gonna
interesting and I had you know 98 99

195
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:52,099
cents and 20 minutes or an hour to get
in

196
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,200
but the great thing is you can just
generating new ideas do with everyone so

197
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:08,058
but this is not doing the server side
story if you have a client that then you

198
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:13,989
know you're gonna get stuff like this
when I was doing just like to Brazil

199
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:20,869
some kind of lonely detection and says
okay this person's value goes above XYZ

200
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:38,529
or somehow they were not pleased and
just people based on their actions have

201
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:46,960
been the wheel you can eventually you'll
get why do something so it's sometimes

202
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:56,029
you can pick up extra spin was drafted
till the server see more than once

203
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:02,569
know that so this is going to come down
here

204
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:12,319
leaders postponed so as did a spin wheel
it says you're probably a few months ago

205
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,630
I wrote on his wall across groups that
you put in your idea and it is the game

206
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,890
for you so you know

207
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,740
that there's like a one day thing and
there's like a once a week thing that is

208
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:36,200
it weren't for like two months to see a
pic working and it was all the see

209
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:44,038
through this he is now required you used
to have you with us in and it would work

210
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:52,079
like it was it requires some kind of
times maybe something to do with the

211
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,930
idea would be to go through all the
questions trying to figure out what this

212
00:36:54,930 --> 00:37:01,609
is but I think it's a good or I don't
know hopefully something not sure that

213
00:37:01,609 --> 00:43:04,720
you can see my brother so I got to wait
before I give up

214
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:50,000
in person to person have not done so
that's kind of interesting

215
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:28,050
is because you really so there's the
whole flashlight that he's done with the

216
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:38,780
questions not like I said not seem like
it didn't work

217
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:47,790
cross-platform as you were so inclined
because it is the original box DVD case

218
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,180
and try to load windows of these

219
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:57,549
just crashes and so what I'm thinking it
has its own fancy

220
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:06,120
bucks one of these might be displayed
the players actually one of these two

221
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,460
but

222
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:16,170
has all these cuties stuff in the video
so if so how it's working on these deals

223
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:27,849
for remarks in making it does everything
just so sweet but not gonna be Windows

224
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:36,810
computer is relatively new so we might
see some stuff drops in here is really

225
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:46,670
varies but yes just straight up 300

226
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:57,530
knox's so I try to keep everything when
does not because of because it makes it

227
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:15,119
more durable and anybody can pick it up
in one of the best questions actually

228
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:22,210
there is little time in there and says I
want to put in my they had asked you

229
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:31,990
wanna be your GPS but it's going to be
GPS thing built into it maybe 30 mins or

230
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:41,160
just use this as an invasion and we'll
see where you were

231
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:51,640
there's a store

232
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:59,250
this I don't mind
