1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:27,180
money was like two seasons in Miami on
Twitter I just one thing

2
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:48,090
so

3
00:00:48,090 --> 00:01:49,370
security and you might expect but it's
not like to see it work

4
00:01:49,370 --> 00:02:08,060
meanwhile energy demand for skills
training place increases and page is

5
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:25,580
pulling on down so we probably have it I
T generally Nations Security which is

6
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:34,569
great job is no coincidence no breach is

7
00:02:34,569 --> 00:05:55,710
a little bit

8
00:05:55,710 --> 00:07:49,590
getting something through the increase

9
00:07:49,590 --> 00:08:08,380
training training done that means I'm
going to lose time everything else done

10
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:15,100
work for a while and we gotta think the
trading very very carefully to make sure

11
00:08:15,100 --> 00:09:14,160
that we train more

12
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:54,480
engagement is really do this and we
don't have the engagement you probably

13
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,500
turn to that person that asked for
solution because you have the other half

14
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,769
but you can't get someone else to have
any interest to start thinking about it

15
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,829
you're not going to tell her how the
solution so we have to think about how

16
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:20,930
to drive engagement up to management to
our peers that's how we solve the

17
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,469
problem of not getting inside some of
the people we have to keep offering the

18
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,880
insides hurt to try to figure out a way
to take it did he understand the idea to

19
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,610
do we offered up a way that was
interesting to the audience because

20
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,930
communication applications not about
what happened on your side's what

21
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,550
happens on

22
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,750
side so how do we get that engagement so
these are all kind of the front and

23
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,860
adjust their standards huge pile of
stuff I'm doing and we're still stuck in

24
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:00,130
trying to solve your problem

25
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:10,870
second part of the problem there are
tremendous demands that kinda go with

26
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,990
the workload problem that kind of go
with the understanding that the little

27
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,940
different aspects I think of this is is
kind of something to keep turning

28
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:29,560
looking different sides of the ROI
analysis project

29
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:46,500
point of this what do you want me here
anytime or something tangible way to

30
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:55,350
return on investment analysis you don't
get asked this last person to do this

31
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:06,980
analysis framework if they don't have a
clear framework of the houses and you

32
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,910
ask them to go with you to financial
worries gonna do look at it and ask them

33
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,390
well as trying something that makes it
rather than building it yourself there

34
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,850
are cases where buildings kill you and
this is one of those things where you

35
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,260
get the idea from somewhere else

36
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,220
by the way if you can get the framework
that's a faster way to go because

37
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,440
apparently works decompile it but my
admission into it and hopefully they'll

38
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,630
get the job done as we do that we're now
having to turn to speak the language of

39
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,520
the business

40
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:58,490
when asked how can I be held in this
world doing the relevant business I have

41
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,110
had many conversations very very bright
people I come I still this conversation

42
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,420
we're trying to express how very
important thing is that need to be done

43
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:26,229
I was working on and he turns it will
ultimately the business + chickens

44
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:32,020
packages themselves well if you cannot
figure out what you're doing is relevant

45
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:42,470
to the business all figured that out
it's far too easy to turn that to really

46
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:48,240
great stuff into a hole that you become
less and less relevant and then the gap

47
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:57,600
between you and the people are asking
rose to shrink that you're on your own a

48
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,030
red team you doing interesting

49
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:06,630
very creative taxing you're coming up
with all sorts of polls they haven't

50
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,270
solved this but if you have not figured
out a way to talk to the blue team size

51
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:20,480
and meet you are so they can start
figuring out how to close that you read

52
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,060
TV is loud noise in this is no
disrespect to read to you it's good to

53
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:36,140
see you done it hard work it's drudgery
no less so than a lot of tasks you gotta

54
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,470
write reports and no one cares but if we
do how to make it relevant on the other

55
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,410
side people start to care

56
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:54,430
start to ask questions in the
conversation codes so why this team

57
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,000
found both of us

58
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:23,089
get some new tools new processes

59
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:39,189
around to trade that too low point was I
don't have time to learn this stuff and

60
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:45,519
the question is can you trade out this
new tool if there's something that's

61
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,740
going to be capable can we put that
cheesy decommission something else to

62
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,660
reduce the complexity of what we have to
deal with so that we can vote is here

63
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:03,490
and not continue to sputter cells like
butter toast so think about can we trade

64
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:13,420
rather than an event rather than just
keep piling on more sweet wish things

65
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:25,260
out we're ready to walk out

66
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,080
so this is these problems walked into a
third set of problems my beliefs about

67
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:50,380
their solutions here how we handle
business culture

68
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:58,649
every place I've gone to a founding
cultures either supporting or destroyed

69
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:26,089
success

70
00:17:26,089 --> 00:18:35,610
really really careful what I do think
about what I just meant that I want to

71
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,918
do your that's gonna give security game
without undermining some other pieces

72
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,250
actually changed because he was positive
and everywhere I've gone to different

73
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,260
people

74
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,679
the Arthouse kind of it yeah we want to
just sometimes highly protected is so I

75
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,410
i mean a good touch culture but I think
about how

76
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:08,950
how we think about security in the
company matters and then concerns

77
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,740
whether we get in the way of their
support making changes how they get in

78
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:28,170
the way our support talking talking up
and change often do it can you just how

79
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:36,220
casual conversation to try 2008 allowed
to go talk across the whole how do you

80
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,590
go do that some companies it's really
easy to do

81
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:47,730
place talk to somebody one of the best
things I was just like the type of the

82
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:57,150
marketing department like they're going
to you and to think they are realizing

83
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:06,560
they're so good making pretty pictures
and i really come to like the marketing

84
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,120
department once I have no idea what I
want to do and strangely enough they

85
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,989
have a lot of influence public relations
and public relations has a certain

86
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:27,300
amount of power because public relations
double right story I'll talk about it

87
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,409
these people can't talk about it

88
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:39,000
ok so I've got friends of marketing and
public relations actually meet friends

89
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,450
of my compliance officer had great
conversations my way around and people

90
00:20:47,450 --> 00:21:03,720
are raising issues to go so well have
the message by the time I actually get

91
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,750
to running my message to the message as
I said the culture counts people are

92
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:19,950
ready to help you on it so here I am sad
and kinda transitioning to the right and

93
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:26,090
if you if you've been there you've
experienced this we're about the time

94
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:35,970
working

95
00:21:35,970 --> 00:23:02,460
we have to start learning because our
company like Apple esta so you really

96
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,090
like this

97
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:10,240
yeah okay so what are the three years of
12 capitalize it I don't care

98
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:21,550
ok years enterprise about 25

99
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,570
live with this for three years I
personally buy something to a new tool

100
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:33,850
capability to take about a year to
integrate it really living with it and I

101
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,459
don't like this can take your find
something else turns out that's the

102
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,540
issue

103
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,980
other companies don't like to capitalize
anything so don't kill them with three

104
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:55,870
year deal to save money investors
returned to me and talk business at

105
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,928
least understand your company approaches
it because it matters whether you buy a

106
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:05,160
three-year by Erwin whatever they want
to do that matters to them how they want

107
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:21,170
to structure finances supposed to be the
right color technology keeps changing

108
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:30,570
faster if you're not going to do
something is fairly complex learning

109
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:38,418
other partners is relevant in states
fast and other issues efficiency

110
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:45,159
don't mix of the two that this is how
good it is to do it may or may not be

111
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:56,769
the most efficient sometimes you make
the trade with the perception of the

112
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:10,840
world doesn't matter how valuable it
really is on the inside here's where do

113
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:19,580
we use in terms of people understand why
do we talk

114
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:40,260
financial limits to recognize those Dec
training opportunities music down time

115
00:25:40,260 --> 00:26:07,610
planning its into something good will be
thrown out over and over again if i dont

116
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,899
prep people to receive the change
changes and you try to bring a really

117
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:26,220
good idea back up again this time no
doubt on the investment side if you are

118
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,680
asked to budget for something even if
you're not getting ready to do something

119
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,150
that is bringing in the new to buy
something today to meet its support to

120
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:47,640
those costs upfront usually they will
get accepted it the whole idea is worth

121
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:56,360
a shot by the way we will have to maybe
try next year they can add to the cost

122
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:04,229
and then finally believe it or not there
is internal competition also to

123
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,860
resources not just money but I'm

124
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:19,850
share gaining Europe top leadership
around something that is very long to

125
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:28,189
conversation and how long you've been
some of you may remember

126
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:38,799
still going on but large conference the
whole focus was always bittersweet calm

127
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:47,260
and they had a large interoperability
know there's an and it would be good

128
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,940
operate across the network stuff work
together most of just watching it very

129
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,230
easily today it's not that hard to get
things to do just that we're doing a lot

130
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:18,530
of connections but the base still going
on but the a probability is huge

131
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,610
just like an address the problem of
getting systems together the idea that I

132
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:31,500
want are putting forth is people how to
work together so it may look like this

133
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:42,820
and you can either call a problem but
the message that work or want to create

134
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,120
a lot more done if we work with others

135
00:28:48,120 --> 00:29:07,678
their deadly 17 work going on this
picture so I also recognize the people

136
00:29:07,679 --> 00:31:31,810
who aren't here on if we get everybody
to start working together

137
00:31:31,810 --> 00:32:39,539
actually

138
00:32:39,539 --> 00:35:24,080
or something

139
00:35:24,080 --> 00:37:12,660
and few more years its program I'm gonna
take that approach 2012 warning warnings

140
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,000
and threats she talked about the to get
too well

141
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:33,990
10 bucks for a USB stick right now and
dropping the USB stick but I do have an

142
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,810
appt

143
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:54,680
yeah they cost yes I got that at the
technology to aid in the more recent

144
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,589
versions of their software anyway my
budget process equipment wasn't working

145
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:24,000
was but that wasn't trying to not sale
until I have to but yeah the

146
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,530
conversations

147
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:45,620
I just tried so in love with Heidi
responsibilities seventeen years ago it

148
00:38:45,620 --> 00:39:03,220
was a great deal of time right now we're
going to get this going but warnings and

149
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,910
then go from there

150
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:36,529
just mentioned which is talking about
risks says thanks thing is

151
00:39:36,530 --> 00:40:48,910
and more I think the messaging

152
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,270
is challenging because they talk about
things that such an abstract level

153
00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:04,500
people talking in general means there
may be other conversations happening

154
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,240
around the company if you can't get the
concern you have about security Street

155
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,120
it but you can talk to other people

156
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:21,900
solutions are happening out there with
some of the things I have to be fixed

157
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,070
and other people start talking about
their chains someone talks about the

158
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,110
revenue side of the business about a
problem because it talk to you about it

159
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:36,130
he said we know there are solutions for
this gives them some ideas on his side

160
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:43,600
can usually get what they want as their
revenue so maybe that idea start to talk

161
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:56,509
with people because its topical now
around you get support for something

162
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:01,430
otherwise

163
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:12,328
this is what it is going to cost you
spend one week

164
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:17,950
hours you know people from each
department for X amount of dollars and

165
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:23,640
have one person commented this is what
we need from you to do to secure your

166
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,069
section and this is why and if you've
got an ROI says you'll spend this much

167
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:35,290
to train these people on a basic
security procedures and this is what

168
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,690
it's going to cost you a potential loss
and they've got that to look at just in

169
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:48,359
very very simplistic terms without any
big words or any long explanations

170
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:57,000
what are the things that are you talking
about potential loss what are the

171
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:09,510
potential losses in the business that we
talked about the rotational communities

172
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:17,299
on your business because no matter how
your business is everybody in the

173
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:22,589
community lives in you as a risk of rage

174
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,259
you know everybody's phone numbers go
out and I've got an 85 phone calls from

175
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:34,589
the telemarketer even something as
simple as that is going to go here

176
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:40,270
other over here to spend so startling
that reputation costs of the impact

177
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,059
could be less lower revenue couldn't be
more phone calls into your support line

178
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,900
saying what are you doing about this is
something that has happened with the

179
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,990
cost of that

180
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:56,270
lawsuits you know the interesting thing
about lawsuits that I've been trying out

181
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:04,290
as I keep looking at that they are
typically win the lawsuit settlement is

182
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:09,279
really expensive it's a lot less than
losing a lawsuit

183
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:19,940
find something relevant to your industry
is asking what is it costing to avoid

184
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:26,130
the loss of their numbers to put up
behind the arc and then try to figure

185
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:31,619
out if we have this conversation about
four hours a week for the organization

186
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,740
ok we can probably get to meet the cost
of that and we're gonna do so solution

187
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:52,549
that's that's a good idea i think is
rebuilding and rol

188
00:44:52,549 --> 00:45:01,499
suggestion is launched and provide lunch
so make sure you have lunch in that cost

189
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:06,339
way time that they would be doing their
jobs you would have to include that

190
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:22,849
expensive your education program is
going to be pretty much no its not get

191
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:58,959
people engaged did you give them repeat

192
00:45:58,959 --> 00:47:45,359
25 questions

193
00:47:45,359 --> 00:49:06,710
so

194
00:49:06,710 --> 00:50:00,000
there

195
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:38,340
love your suggestions and input in
conversation not how I get better

196
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:42,410
building bridges I just think it's
critical and just as much as compassion

197
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:47,089
about security we gonna meet their
passion realizes we thank you very much
