bridges also a big fan of NCR which is

5
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,839
why I was looking for artists and then
just because we had an incident this

6
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:48,110
year with an ass a speaker change will
pretty much because my handle is gonna

TCEQ coming weeks leading into the
things I did troll John schindler on

10
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:43,299
Twitter general perspective this before

11
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,490
up which is possible that Giordano

12
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:57,110
later and then I just tell you what
would you tell her now it's the

13
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:04,119
extensible messaging and presence is
completely over but first jack preserver

14
00:02:04,119 --> 00:04:06,540
implementation jeopardy which released
in 1999 and then there was actually work

15
00:04:06,540 --> 00:08:54,209
situations where I both companies so
effective in double open it up

16
00:08:54,209 --> 00:10:58,920
harder

17
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:14,099
just before the full movie and go and I
was 15 I boogeyman haha I stations

18
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:26,800

19
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,219
trying to today and the doctor wants to
ruin your day

20
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:48,800
they decided going to take this release
tactic is pointless stuff like the

21
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:58,979
pressure actually given immunity under
the auspices 2008 they were texting

22
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,889
basically every day and you and you got
was a global

23
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:15,609
and bridge right during a presidential
election i think i think thats pretty

24
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:28,279
much about what I said alright general
reporting restrictions only decrypted

25
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,569
versions showing ciphers

26
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:40,949
forward secrecy and then I'll talk about
the EC true to its research question but

27
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:50,139
I'll talk about it and then go to bed is
off the record which in any provision so

28
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:57,129
you don't have to trust search kind of
nice things and then tour service

29
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:07,040
disabled because of all the SSL settings
any clients will pretty much be forced

30
00:13:07,040 --> 00:14:20,589
where you can have something slightly
when it's kind of like take

31
00:14:20,590 --> 00:16:04,600
paper which

32
00:16:04,600 --> 00:18:45,140
because

33
00:18:45,140 --> 00:21:32,980
and controls

34
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:57,490
words don't text actually be done it
will tell you one server runs in

35
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:07,470
jeopardy

36
00:22:07,470 --> 00:26:16,230
hundreds

37
00:26:16,230 --> 00:27:03,960
to certain targeted by and he gave me
just outside the box and it's a good

38
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:32,970
news is a problem probably does 2001
call 08 please in like this there's no

39
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,030
bright and basically what he was using
the same crimes and OpenSSL common

40
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:50,379
libraries and so basically so they've
been breaking the recent research right

41
00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:01,440
unofficial excuse for not helping
organize this

42
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:11,179
