1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:16,460
this is my job rendering videos from the
previous year program site cutie so

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,810
I don't stop my talk is talk and also
the talks so far so why should I pay

3
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,399
attention to the daddy of two degrees
out bachelors in electrical engineering

4
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:42,210
masters and software engineering and
responsible for you for you on a

5
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:55,359
supercomputer not connected to the much
as I read and I read read read and learn

6
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:03,390
that actually and variable bit rate of
these risks or recently x264 AAC MKV

7
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:12,340
compression just another step on it

8
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:19,909
and there's still a little bit talk
another actually recovered according of

9
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:26,030
these videos just like how I put
everything together so that i dont Con

10
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:40,079
2013 cars.com con Dios region candidates
and other ways during the supports they

11
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,048
do it's called open broadcasters and
actually combine everything on the fly

12
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,520
as low as a post-process processing that
way I can add fun little David Spade

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,658
outside including audio video that cool
closes weeks but mostly demonstration

14
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:12,860
talks talks in common it's always so I
always recommend remedial stuff on the

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,799
Windows side of personal interest will
define those are two separate programs

16
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:26,700
jesse is for smokey source of evidence
and play as always cool not easy convert

17
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:37,849
some people say that's what it takes to
get into that sideways in player always

18
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:47,120
cool if your personal dog cross-platform
open-source everyone knows that

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,709
x264 crimson is probably the best to 60
or older I do not recommend overshot and

20
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,209
I'll get to that the second voice you
start with that and then a bunch of

21
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:07,800
issues and so I switched over to a
program called life

22
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:18,810
I started off on Windows using DVD
Shrink DVD Decrypter Adi send

23
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,920
VirtualDubMod exclude land all that fun
stuff and eventually a chance to the

24
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,839
Linux side of things in 2012 and I can
do everything else making TV and command

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:41,800
line from the source of my drive even if
in fact I'm not the one button placket

26
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,870
alright I'm not a big fan of that but
I'd recommend what I say just because it

27
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,280
actually gets the settings so Norwich
talks aimed at open shot Jonathan Thomas

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,460
are easier to go over Texas

29
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,760
the video editing tools that existed in
2008 so

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:17,139
powerful states on the GZA in OT
framework and a number of it can work

31
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:38,560
with a lot of work to do and basically I
am so tired of writing this only person

32
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,840
choosing the worse there was a
Kickstarter in April 2013 and an awesome

33
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:53,789
new features whose films include a new
collaborative partners want Windows

34
00:04:53,789 --> 00:05:05,240
Linux and neck and still undeveloped

35
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:19,880
expose it crashed off and not actually
exporting preceding the project file is

36
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:42,009
a common interest to do so it's for
example he said my next update 2015 days

37
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:49,060
it was going through a transition so
that was issued there so some other

38
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:57,720
issues workers that there is no audio
away from everything should know should

39
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,620
deliver whenever you get two singles
very close to children

40
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:16,150
discussing percentages and 53% over here
rather than that takes all six hundred

41
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,400
and some cases X&Y and then

42
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,859
which is the wife then X so pay
attention to that would actually open

43
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,880
the Properties and click you can see our
full of 10 seconds of this great just

44
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,560
need another 10 seconds off it would
actually had written and cut off from

45
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,169
the beginning and all your vision is
just helps to there was nobody there is

46
00:06:49,169 --> 00:07:03,849
no way to see video audio and video as
well use it to literally do with 264 CRS

47
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,449
would actually have exported to a
massive files using peds and ways and to

48
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:18,870
confirm that day

49
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:28,360
concentrate factor is trying very single
pass

50
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,270
excluding YouTube has to be the first
and second password use a static file

51
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:42,010
free then the first passes for 64 bit or
64 bits here with the CRS concentrate

52
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:54,349
factor that he wants 2309 concentrate
factor something of 18 alright but it's

53
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,400
actually inversely cell phone number is
higher quality higher number is so it's

54
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:09,138
very much a bye this one this one i dont
care of all sizes

55
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:20,270
for a single export it as a bit now and
then so every five minutes I haven't had

56
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,330
to have new thing should put a new files

57
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:33,019
stretch it out so for an hour and a half
long video around one talks so I

58
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:43,828
switched over to live well it was
initially developed in 2002 place in

59
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,180
2014

60
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,859
they've actually been picked up by the
Chinese friend work just recently as the

61
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:05,870
name implies you know you say well as
the GPA 2008 in life police package is

62
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:15,630
actually the dead and Jesse proposed law
that libraries that he's actually run

63
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:40,130
some ideas that process was junk out so
I'll cell phone video processing is more

64
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,579
time and

65
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:53,248
just as charming to resolution there is
no place for progressive rates using our

66
00:09:53,249 --> 00:10:02,299
video to audio decided to transitions
exported

67
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:13,239
17 18 1920 by 1080 resolution
progressive 26 friends second those the

68
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:26,759
specs on the speaker can and do so that
is pretty standard has 13 friends and a

69
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,299
speaker video has actually created in
our twins since they can use light

70
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:40,249
naturally I just explored everything
else so I had to work with in 7 10 317

71
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:43,390
640 by 480 and people were

72
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,880
reading 1897 2484 for this live videos

73
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,210
speaker videos 1080 1080p

74
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:07,430
way for general use for 319 we're just
learning to adjust to french toast which

75
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,969
I discussed this up five minutes but
just senator here

76
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:23,950
vertically and so they come out with
speaker speaker feed at 1280 by 720

77
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,900
height 640 by 480 and then offset

78
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,000
centered on the y axis title slide is
bumped up the price of the speaker video

79
00:11:34,000 --> 00:13:19,769
so with all that said

80
00:13:19,769 --> 00:15:38,730
job

81
00:15:38,730 --> 00:19:00,220
crazy

82
00:19:00,220 --> 00:20:46,419
over

83
00:20:46,419 --> 00:25:04,470
transition

84
00:25:04,470 --> 00:28:22,600
something

85
00:28:22,600 --> 00:29:13,580
216

86
00:29:13,580 --> 00:31:22,570
something

87
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:35,120
and a tattoo parlors and feeling to
retrieve the same time

88
00:31:35,120 --> 00:32:31,360
yes

89
00:32:31,360 --> 00:34:25,889
166

90
00:34:25,889 --> 00:39:20,120
ok

91
00:39:20,120 --> 00:40:08,589
720 right for you to do whatever

92
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:15,030
something like when I'm do about two
hours long and I want it
