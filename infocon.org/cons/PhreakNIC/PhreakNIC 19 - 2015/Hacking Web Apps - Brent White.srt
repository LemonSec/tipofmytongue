1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:08,750
come into my talk names current wife
when I talk about adding web more along

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,248
the lines of sort of an introduction and
reason like this talk is sort of help

3
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:18,950
close the gap between developers who are
not quite sure how to secure their

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,330
absolute error code or anybody's
interested in getting into in person so

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,579
I'm basically give a high-level overview
as a security consultant what I do all

6
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,219
the way to airport delivery for an
assessment for an application web

7
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:47,809
application before he can start packing
or whether you're going to town on a

8
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:53,849
client's website is things that you have
to do for us we usually watch all this

9
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,809
is where we will discuss things such as
in the rules of engagement document

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,339
where this clarifies the scope so what
is the URL that we're actually looking

11
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:14,130
at what I peas is alleged the malicious
traffic so they know they have security

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,089
operations center something they're not
alerting everyone because they are

13
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,570
expecting us to be sending malicious
traffic at certain time and then when do

14
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,449
we start assessment when do we stop also
if we happens in October a service issue

15
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,030
on either end we have contacts we know
who we can call wake up at three in the

16
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,700
morning and

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:46,200
they're happy place that broke something
here in this assessment document as much

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,270
as you can because a report is expected
at the end of the USS so there have been

19
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,670
times as a new consulting where there
were more abilities that I found but I

20
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,929
was decided to keep going and so I
forgot to document this and when it came

21
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:08,929
time reporting to ask the client or more
access to the system because I forgot to

22
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,120
document something so just keep that in
mind and this document everything as you

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:24,329
go how do I got my choice as keynote in
this is available in Cali Linux it also

24
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:30,290
has installed for Mac OS or Windows and
it's just that it's an open source tool

25
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,798
that allows it to you but and codes free
shots or leagues are basically anything

26
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,569
and the cool thing about it is that a
client or another consultant once to see

27
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,048
sort of your break it down and put in
the report you can explore all of it as

28
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,260
basic HTML files so they can see
everything without having to install

29
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,630
he'd known as well as they don't have it
so that's pretty handy

30
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:08,350
so you can see how things down so if
there are a few different applications

31
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:14,510
on the same assessment then you can see
they haven't broken down by IP right

32
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,940
here or hostname and then all but
whenever I find or its just a handful or

33
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:31,230
one application the layout of what I
find and you'll find that the more that

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,329
he do this you're going to change the
way that the way they document things

35
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,220
this is probably the third or fourth
time that I changed how I do this and I

36
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,100
found that this is what works best for
me and is what helps me to move along

37
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,750
faster your reporting and just
referencing vulnerabilities so just play

38
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,990
around with the color-coding the green I
use that to say hey this is just some

39
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,710
quick go to information like what is the
scope of our forget a username or

40
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,370
password I can look at that and say I
didn't ignore everything that's green

41
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,180
dark red in the red would be serious

42
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,640
hi however your your company rates those
things and so on and for me that's just

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:24,110
a quick visual of you know how the
applications working so far so a lot of

44
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,450
times for everyone about tests are going
to have your HTTP request and response

45
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,390
was that way the client can see what it
is that you see and what the actual

46
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,930
response was this way when they go
through and they are trying to mediate

47
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,550
these things they can they can reproduce
the same results that you got you also

48
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,620
want to make sure you note any scheduled
downtime so you're trying here actress

49
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,230
in that location all sudden

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,110
that's gone and you can access that
anymore make sure you write down when

51
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,780
that happened that way if something did
go down if it was an accidental Dallas

52
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,690
service or something then you can say
okay this happened at 11:42 and this

53
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,480
will help their guys to be able to go
back and look at logs and try and track

54
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,220
it down so that makes it a lot easier
for the client as well and if they did

55
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,140
you test accounts and when you do change
the passwords make sure you let them

56
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,510
know what the passwords are some people
get upset to change it and don't let him

57
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,780
go and then again if you're working on a
bank website or e-commerce or something

58
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,599
and they don't give you a test credit
card you have to use you know something

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,960
from the company or something

60
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:55,780
make sure that you like that you know
give you your money back if you have a

61
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,780
really poor I see guys get in trouble
with us before you have a really high

62
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,609
and it's exciting especially this one of
the first ones do not share screenshot

63
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,920
about online if you do make sure you
saying that I that's so that you can

64
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:18,010
tell this is really where it came from
so keep that in mind there's some more

65
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,810
on evidence gathering when you're
putting your screenshots and your report

66
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,290
or something that you're going to send
to the required to the client make sure

67
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,550
that something they can actually read
just keep in mind if you have if you had

68
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,710
a really being resolution on your screen
and you do the entire screen shot in the

69
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,120
report is the normal page with you have
to squeeze that down they're not going

70
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,280
to be able to read a lot of stuff on
there so just make sure that you keep

71
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:51,059
that in mind here's an example data
based on from Season One Direction there

72
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,200
was a lot of information there are
several several rows of information

73
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,450
personally identifiable information and
things that I wanted to show but

74
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,990
obviously doing huge screenshot of that
as you can see him and squeeze it down

75
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,760
on a document like a printable documents
gonna be really hard to read that

76
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,990
especially with the black background
reading texts so did you know that and

77
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,030
pasted onto something that works many
more like this a lot more legible and

78
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,400
they're not trying to squint to see
what's important again with this example

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,450
you can see the highlighted area in the
username browner I call that out that

80
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,700
way in the report review or mediation
they can quickly see what it is that

81
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,909
they need to throw in that parameter to
get the same results to show that it's

82
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,860
possible to see the injection in this
would be you know for cross-site

83
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,440
scripting or whatever it is that you're
trying to call out whatever the

84
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,719
vulnerability is or what the payload
that she sent to trigger that make sure

85
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,960
you highlight those just to make it
easier for them then example the

86
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,020
injection for sure the username you also
want to make sure that s like the

87
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,370
password perimeter or any single

88
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,640
any parameter that is within that
application check it for Seymour

89
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,770
injection as well or whatever it is that
you're looking for and make sure to

90
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,349
document those have actually seen junior
investors where they just fine for

91
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,630
example the user name is vulnerable

92
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,000
task or what about the password grandeur
and say well I don't know I'm on user

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,349
name brand new and moved on so just make
sure you're checking every parameter

94
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,840
within the application

95
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,590
when you're doing tests are so many
things to look for

96
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,170
there's a lot of stuff to do and so
something that highly recommend it

97
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,819
highly recommend it is to have a
methodology to go by such as and this is

98
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,490
more of a checklist to help keep you in
line today she's not forgetting

99
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:15,050
something and I don't just many years
2002 that methodology is a check list in

100
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,170
case there something that is leaving out
but please use it just more of a

101
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:28,560
reminder for each you want to make sure
you're doing when you're looking at

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,099
whether you want to go and look out on
the internet to see what you can find

103
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,840
through open source intelligence figure
out if there's already been a breach of

104
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,710
this company or there have been so many
times where I've actually found a base

105
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:54,350
types of a scheme as he's passwords as
well as the email address of the

106
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,530
developers working on that occasion and
all of that stuff is still relevant

107
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,850
so you can find things like that but
around there so tip to developers if you

108
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,270
are posting something on a Help forum
and you know we're trying to get help

109
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:17,510
for anything any tour any any type of
programming make sure that you sanitize

110
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,370
your information to share with the world
so just change change the database name

111
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,420
change something slightly where someone
like me finds its not gonna be relevant

112
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,229
to that application and assessment if
you have someone that's helping you well

113
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,310
or not the end of the seventh but yes
someone that's helping you out on these

114
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,239
forums and you give them temporary
access

115
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,980
make sure that you count when they're
finished try to forget about it because

116
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,970
that has helped us to you

117
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:58,050
dumps and data bases

118
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,370
equipped all that I like to use in there
are so many of these out there for open

119
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:11,230
source intelligence is discover by
leaving here and I don't think that that

120
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,370
comes pre-installed you install it
yourself pretty easy you can see it does

121
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,800
quick recall on or you can get a domain
that you're assessing or persons name

122
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,620
for ourselves for us there are several
things that you can do that really

123
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,620
helped save time you're going to hear me
talk to you about and then you will

124
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,470
automatically launch 242 search against
just do a quick and it's the website or

125
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,630
no back-up files know what happened in
URLs or anything that would be

126
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:55,220
low-hanging fruit for an attacker

127
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,319
ok automated scanning automated tool was
supposed to be a happier well they're

128
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:07,459
huge time saver so when we run we
started this isn't really only have a

129
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:16,219
week maybe two weeks so it's pretty
quick so I mean it scatters itself it's

130
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,170
gonna spiders had to go through and look
at everything as quick as possible and

131
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,000
again it's going to help you find low
hanging fruit such as scripting or

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,529
potential sequel injection war you know
if it's found backup files or anything

133
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,360
that these games combined

134
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:43,160
it's just a nice nice tool the house
however vulnerabilities and is not a

135
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,910
Pinterest it's just a boner abilities
can so to those who say that once can is

136
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,699
appended

137
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,030
so well is just standing in billings
that's not going through and trying to

138
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,640
exploit those even further and you're
going to get false positives so you have

139
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,199
to go through and verify manually verify
all of the results from these automated

140
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,110
scanners and you're going to use those a
lot of times you can actually go

141
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,480
scanners will have a buddy or you can
actually attack see more in depth the

142
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,000
response and that will help you
determine right away if it's a false

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,520
positive or not so while you're here I
go again it helps you get out the things

144
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,300
that are false positives in the things
that are you can dig deeper into those

145
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,120
so if you find cross-site scripting and
the scanners just bringing back the

146
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:56,830
wrong that says access and you know that
can you do something or what can you do

147
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:05,840
to take that further automated scanners
and other so many out there but the ones

148
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,080
that I used personally Nessus this is a
good win that can get the host itself

149
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,730
and now you can specify credentials and
things to do authenticated scans but I

150
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:25,820
use this mostly just specifically look
at the host IBM a scan is another good

151
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,410
one that I like to use its pretty robust
really get it for authenticated scan

152
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:39,949
you have quite a bit of control over
that you're going to hear me mention

153
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:46,870
that several times while the store has
automated scanning built into it as well

154
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,620
as manual there's a lot of manual
testing that when you as well my

155
00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:04,579
one-stop shop for testing and then as I
already mentioned 45 or abilities

156
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:10,319
vulnerable strips or and I use these
tools separately all the tools

157
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:17,519
separately as they're all going to have
slightly different results so it's it's

158
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:31,459
gonna get better results and not just
rely on a website that's open source

159
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:37,540
framework like WordPress or Drupal or
Joomla or something like that though

160
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:45,459
there are some cool cool tools like this
w me scan and it specifically for

161
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,479
WordPress and so will think about this
is a logo through and it will tell you

162
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,300
in person and if it's out of date so
that you're not having to Google and

163
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,389
reference to see bears the burden
because WordPress baby updated versions

164
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:06,269
were like every other week or something
so it's a good game for that it also

165
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:12,449
scans it will enumerate any plugins that
they're using so they are using that has

166
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:20,930
known vulnerabilities such as the old
and had basically

167
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:28,880
website that this trip will also
enumerate user names so this is cool

168
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,910
cares if you know the user names and
they don't have any sort of blocking on

169
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,350
the website you can do so again they
have tools like this for Drupal and

170
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,410
Joomla and other known in ColdFusion I
was getting hope you some sites because

171
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:55,760
they're so easy for automated scanning I
think I like to find more like to use

172
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,920
his or her buster and this is bad for
store that will go through and you can

173
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:09,000
do a pure brute force to find directory
names that exists in the other content

174
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,150
or you can get a list of very large list
that it comes with known directory and

175
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,730
file names and you can also look on the
bottom right on if you can see you back

176
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,209
here but you can also specify file
extensions that you want to look for so

177
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:35,630
here you and you alone the word lists
and unsavory books forum index PHP NID

178
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,610
SPX studies you know whatever extensions
you have here and still goes to sleep

179
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,969
for some good things it takes a long
time but it can pay off especially if

180
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,530
you're looking at a web app that seems
pretty secure

181
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,470
hitting a wall and what to do next let
this store on for a while and might find

182
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,420
something good

183
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:10,380
scares in Cali and this is different now
since telling too but television wine

184
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,290
and this was the path of fun more
scanners that are built in and then sync

185
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,740
and expose those or other popular ones
as well

186
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:28,770
ok tips or automated scanning

187
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,090
by the settings it's really bad it's a
bad idea just opened scanner but in the

188
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,800
URL and click Run several things can
happen you can let the host of potential

189
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,899
analysis because it's an old really old
server then cannot get over this

190
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,210
actually happened times for larger
clients that you hope aren't using old

191
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,680
legacy systems but in story comments 0

192
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,370
you know look at the number of
connections and it's going to make those

193
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,510
that a single time

194
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,770
and this is something to eat more that
you do this morning to figure out just

195
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,770
browsing at the website initially the
response time and looking at the code

196
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,930
will be able to tell if this is this is
something that you can hit really hard

197
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:31,360
to have the baby yet call something
that's very important to ask are there

198
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,510
any chance that you want to avoid the
assessment for example if they have a

199
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,000
contact for more or something that your
automated scanners just going to keep

200
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,050
hitting over and over again there's
gonna be some poor soul that's going to

201
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,810
get thousands of emails

202
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,110
vacations from Orem or its gonna jump up
a database or something so make sure to

203
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,949
ask those questions like what he wants
to avoid or on the other hand is there

204
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,120
something that you really want us to
focus on you have a page that's more

205
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,469
sensitive that you want to spend more
time on the other things and they'll

206
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:15,220
tell you they let you know another issue
is even if a web page at the site

207
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,000
doesn't exist I'm sorry page doesn't
exist in your doing scanners we're gonna

208
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,860
get 200 OK response from everything so I
can swing or something it's got

209
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,770
everything that you have in your
dictionary that you're looking for is

210
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,310
going to return everything that is an
actual page it's a pain in the butt to

211
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:44,550
clean up and takes forever to go through
so in these answers most use a page not

212
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:52,100
found where you can change it to 200 ok
and given the size and it will basically

213
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,928
take that as a 404 page not found

214
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:06,639
so if you do have credentials make sure
that test beforehand make sure they work

215
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:12,590
and then that way it's not like
Wednesday night or Thursday morning over

216
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,709
on Friday and you're just now asking the
client to check the credentials they

217
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,159
gave because they're not working that
looks bad so make sure you check that

218
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:29,119
helped to make sure here again that you
can login ok something I don't have on

219
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:35,289
here that want to make sure it to stress
you always do an application assessment

220
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:43,830
as an unauthenticated user and then as
user so they can call home and ask for

221
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:52,379
their admin level credentials and I also
need regular local user credentials that

222
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:59,498
way you can look for things such as
privilege escalation so are you able to

223
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:06,289
get into pages that the admin see as the
regular user or as an authenticated user

224
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:12,570
are you able to get two pages in the
functions that often he did you see so

225
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:21,519
always made sure to ask for all levels
of authentication counts then once you

226
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,789
have everything set up a new are
confident about your settings then you

227
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:27,940
can go ahead

228
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:38,340
and as mentioned earlier get past this
but as I mentioned earlier make sure

229
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,879
that you really manually verify the
automated scanners results gonna be mad

230
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:47,879
you just trust the scanner wrote in the
report declines looking at it and they

231
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:52,360
can't replicate the results because
there's nothing to replicate and ask you

232
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,039
about it and he can't give them an
answer other than sorry

233
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,350
so that's that's not a good situation

234
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,870
ok any questions so far and I'm moving
through the stuff we're all have

235
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:19,090
questions to you have any questions for
later

236
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:28,740
specific website ok so we'll go over
manual testing and this is something

237
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,330
that is so high level because the manual
testing there are so many different ways

238
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,590
to do this that if you get stuck on
something Google is going to be your

239
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,530
best friend there are so many free
videos out there that will teach you

240
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,928
exactly what it is you're wanting to do
so if you ever get stuff on on how to

241
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:54,260
explain how to eat a cross-site
scripting further or something lighter

242
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:02,450
remote file inclusion anything like that
make sure that you check out and it will

243
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,550
you will learn how to do it

244
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:16,639
to look at while you're really calling
the out the response what is the

245
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,920
surprise is that Apache IIS outdated
there's a lot of times legacy systems or

246
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,080
I'm hatch systems that are vulnerable to
things such as partly something that's

247
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,310
really there in several times where been
able to compromise the entire post

248
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:43,629
without getting into the web at the web
because I'm that so make sure you check

249
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,370
that out

250
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:52,449
you heard me talk about earlier any
primer you find things to do not sure

251
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,500
exactly what buzzing is or how to do it
again

252
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,120
Google will give you tools to do that
such as wooden cross site scripting or

253
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,709
sequel injection and things like that

254
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:15,570
here's just a quick reference popular
things to look forward that are pretty

255
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:26,800
easy to find out so without explains
these things

256
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,580
sweet bro cool thing I like about
virtually bro is that if you have any of

257
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:39,490
these lists from offer something that
are known as they're known payloads to

258
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,570
process scripting you can throw that
list in the air and specify what you

259
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,280
want to go I wanted to go to you and it
will automatically run through that list

260
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,710
same thing of yours went into early
quick and dirty check or sequel

261
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,140
injection or just general data
validation you can throw on some list

262
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,540
but first we grow and then you can
specify the brand and you can within a

263
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,990
minute or so depending on how large the
listed as you get your response to see

264
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:18,330
if these parameters of being filtered
properly or if not that's something you

265
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:26,439
should keep pursuing

266
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,700
things to look at how they passing
sensitive information through in the URL

267
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:39,769
3 get requests post requests for example
when you're and you could go and the URL

268
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:45,950
of do you see your username or password
or anything that says a lot for that

269
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,590
because it's not being cat or if there's
man-in-the-middle attack or is someone

270
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:57,500
gains control of the host later on then
they can see in the history they can

271
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,860
simply history you are all these
potential credentials are sensitive

272
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,059
information so you want to make sure
that anything sensitive is going through

273
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:17,139
a post requests and source code this is
a great one that seems like probably

274
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:23,178
eighty to ninety percent of us something
just three comments and source code or

275
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:30,500
someone pointing to that database name
or credentials or something that they

276
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:38,590
left us a comment to another developer
or you can see the only goal line a

277
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,658
comment for basically every line telling
you exactly what that code does well if

278
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,519
you look at that sometimes you can
engineer that and use that to your

279
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,730
advantage to figure out ok I know
exactly what this javascript is doing

280
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,509
and we're getting whatever from because
the developers just told me exactly what

281
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:02,629
it does so make sure that you're going
through in looking at those comments and

282
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:19,330
the source code really time consuming
sometimes but now

283
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:29,939
as I mentioned earlier occasion there's
a good reason again to test as an

284
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,570
unauthenticated user as well as
authenticated users is there something

285
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:41,060
that you can get to that you're not
supposed to see so many times people try

286
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:47,020
to use security by obscurity so whether
you're a regular user or you're an admin

287
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:53,150
mobile user may try to hide certain
leaks from you just from job as well if

288
00:28:53,150 --> 00:29:00,120
you go look at the code you can see the
links in their admin / whatever I have

289
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,399
to do is copy and paste that and now
you're looking at adding pages that were

290
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,670
supposed to be hidden from the view so
go through the looking different URLs

291
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,310
especially because I know it sounds
silly but that's most of the time when

292
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:23,280
they're going to say is at an analyst
say if if you're not an admin hi this

293
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,080
it's it's really obvious and that led to
that developers don't want to you know

294
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,050
you don't want to rename everything we
have to try and have some reference to

295
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:44,889
go through just to stand what it is that
your code is best to do so you need to

296
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:51,760
check password requirements he said your
password is ABC 123 or just password if

297
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,450
so it's only password and its findings
document that I need to be at least

298
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:04,440
eight characters and they should require
special characters as well

299
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:14,070
let the host Knights stay out something
that's outdated again are there is

300
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,250
available 0 lifetime you're fine with
patches tom cat or something that is

301
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:27,590
accessible to the public which is that
should only be accessible by certain

302
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,780
IP's

303
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,420
widely available depending on his case
again if you're not quite sure what the

304
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,270
use cases but you think its ability I
was doing reported anyway and you can

305
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:45,730
always talk that through with a client
here they say well this has to be

306
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,390
available because this is how they
access whatever and it makes sense that

307
00:30:51,390 --> 00:31:02,250
you can always drop but it's better to
be safe than sorry

308
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:08,460
you want to look for HTTP methods that
are dangerous such as a hobby to leave

309
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,920
and trace I've actually do you host
simply because they had but and so I put

310
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,680
a lot into strips that gave me a show
host and pretty much had my way with it

311
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,130
compromised it within maybe twenty
thirty minutes

312
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:31,210
assessment so look for those things and
they have any methods that you're not

313
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,410
sure about why they're using it again
report that and then talk later with

314
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,770
them

315
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:47,050
directory for things like directory
traversal

316
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:52,760
automated scanners things that just need
to automatically look for those for you

317
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:00,670
as well and this this particular example
is a great reason great example of

318
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:07,190
scares saving you a lot I don't know
about you but going up to the URL and

319
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:16,300
doing more / 04 / timing doesn't work
and trying it eight times and it's going

320
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,270
to be very time consuming so the
audience can really help with things

321
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,299
like that

322
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:30,529
is great as well what do they have
everything over the world they have a

323
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:36,619
remote desktop open to the public which
does happen or is it just worked for

324
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:51,879
three things as I sell things as you may
know a lot of our abilities as the cell

325
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:59,418
versions and then pls versions and weak
ciphers so there are several free tools

326
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:06,119
that will actually go and quickly hand
there there and let them know that you

327
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:14,668
have all the CDC's you know we signing
key or whatever it is make sure that

328
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:22,700
you're looking at the facility listings
as well or are they even using SSL and

329
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,509
you know certain websites that they have
authentication or something that's not

330
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,169
going over a secure connection that's a
boner ability to pay attention of those

331
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:38,659
things

332
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:45,440
mentioned earlier check out different
methodologies and is a popular one get

333
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,009
this helps keep you on track and just
getting into this we're not exactly sure

334
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:54,739
what to do what to look for work where
do I start and when things start looking

335
00:33:54,739 --> 00:34:03,489
at these methodologies will help get you
on track and hope so make sure you

336
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:07,989
practice in a lab there's some
vulnerable p.m. so vulnerable web apps

337
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:13,129
that are far more on purpose for you to
practice all of these things and the

338
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:19,270
safety of your own lab peter is you
never want to go into a client-side and

339
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,379
run a tool that you've never used before
because if you don't know what it does

340
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:31,239
do it especially on client-side
reductions you break something and they

341
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,989
come in they say what you do and say I
dont know thats bad that's a bad day so

342
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:47,439
it just makes you practice and when
you're ready and websites

343
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:56,780
that's basically where slides but how do
I have to miss ok jerry has plenty of

344
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:07,380
time for Q&A and I know it was pretty
quick so many questions you guys have if

345
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:17,660
you have any specific tools you have the
top I cannot remove the name of Cali

346
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:25,810
like a Jew scanner June scam to send ya
a website isn't that a little rebuilding

347
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:32,390
itself yes it is and that's actually a
great one because we had clients that

348
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,379
have gotten so upset with that someone
like that infrastructure for that

349
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:44,450
website this died because it would send
out say for example contact we hand it

350
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:50,319
and it would send out a notification so
that would go to the email server and

351
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,029
then the attack would go in the net was
trying to send an email back to this to

352
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:03,670
let him know something was going on in
so so I guess high-level what happened

353
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:16,410
11 malicious attack that was sent you
know they had set up something

354
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,609
said they wanted to get mad at us from
flooding the system when all we did was

355
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:28,310
the basics and that $400 client wishes
and so that is a great point if you are

356
00:36:28,310 --> 00:37:04,779
automated and that should be handled by
everything great something you have

357
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:28,390
you also want to make sure that you're
covered to say I'm not exactly sure who

358
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,009
worry but it's basically saying there is
a chance that were not want to find

359
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,930
everything so if your compromise from
something that we haven't overlooked we

360
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:47,450
are not responsible for that because
good reason for that is about to change

361
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:53,069
all time so they buy I would hear well
last month and you guys have a person

362
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:58,860
update or something or a new exploit
comes available that wasn't available

363
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,520
when we look at that I mean there's what
can you do about that unless you want us

364
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,480
to do an assessment every month or every
week and that gets pretty expensive so

365
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,450
you do have to have the image in there
basically covering the company and just

366
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:23,210
letting them know we will find what we
can find my overlook some things and if

367
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:29,660
we do we aren't responsible so

368
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,538
webcam to could crash on my website

369
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:42,559
yeah that's one of those things to that
practice thing that stuck in a while if

370
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,089
your lab environment handles it that's
cool you can go into an environment

371
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:53,990
where it's the system were they there
are variations on the server or you know

372
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,808
like the example i gave where the
service was sending so many instances

373
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:06,140
over and over so it's kinda hard to say
never happen in a quiet environment it's

374
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:12,490
kinda hard to say that so a way to sort
of things that I mean it does happen

375
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:18,089
sometimes unfortunately but all you can
do when it does happen is just be ready

376
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:28,690
cause the scanner don't have a scanner
and then leave brunch and something's

377
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:34,400
gone wrong however that's not going to
fly and yes laugh at that but that's

378
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:42,150
been insulting someone who is no longer
with the company he was because that was

379
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,480
an issue and so yeah that's another

380
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,210
don't hit a scanner and then leave make
sure there today he said it that way you

381
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,839
can give them hugs wherever they can
figure out what caused it

382
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:21,690
any links between the email server issue
that goes beyond just realities yeah we

383
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,019
we have that as you we have some people
were clients they're pretty sensitive

384
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:34,200
websites that leads to other things and
so this is where scope is very important

385
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,578
so that's where for example the
automated scanners you want to make sure

386
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:45,739
that you're specifying the scope and
where they say don't hit this submit

387
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:50,960
made because that actually goes out of
scope to you this other side and you

388
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,339
don't want to start hiring that just
because it was linked so that's where

389
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:02,650
you ask what do you want us to get food
and then you make sure to specify those

390
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:10,650
scare as well as any manual standing he
doesn't keep no thing that I found in my

391
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,940
scope on my scope age I will list the
things that we are not supposed to hit

392
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,009
and I'll make sure to reference that and
make sure that I'm not moving and

393
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:41,170
getting something that does happen
pretty regularly

394
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:59,690
pretty strong systems and their
production and then pretty much a mere

395
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:07,880
sight so with that all the rules of
engagement will specify from this date

396
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,089
to this day all manual and automated
scanning is 24 by seven and then we have

397
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:20,299
clients that say this is a production
site so there is a chance that anything

398
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:27,210
can be brought down only automated
scanning from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. manual

399
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,520
testing can be 24 myself so that we do
have to specify those terms lot and we

400
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,980
do have some that only one has to do
Friday night to Sunday morning so that's

401
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:45,470
kind of important because your weekend
sometimes but you know it's not that bad

402
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:55,470
it doesn't happen as often but it does
happen

403
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:02,750
allocated to report anything that I
found that was not necessarily in scope

404
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:11,500
I think probably from the standpoint I
feel as though I am contractually I'm

405
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:19,230
not quite sure how late on this but
there have been a few instances where

406
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:26,240
the open source intelligence we're
actually found another web out on the

407
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,910
host that was given to us where I
uploaded a lot in the script and they

408
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:36,390
gave me tell you that and I probably
shouldn't have done that because it

409
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:43,029
wasn't necessarily the application that
but I felt like it was an extra services

410
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,920
that are provided to the client because
I knew right away when I saw that it was

411
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,099
really old and that it would be
vulnerable so I just wanted to check now

412
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:57,440
when I reported that I did it as a
separate email guys I found this I want

413
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,310
you to know that but I did not included
in their official report because it was

414
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,190
so I think as long as you do it that way

415
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:14,010
always ask you guys think I found this
phone call I just check it out just to

416
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:20,130
make sure what I think it is pretty
critical and pretty easy to exploit most

417
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,349
of the time let us know because we don't
you know we don't have

418
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:30,869
beach so I just kept on them and then
again if it sounds go just because he

419
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:43,160
made out of the report says it's not any
