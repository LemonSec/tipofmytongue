1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:11,030
about this

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,390
it's a book

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,770
ok

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,460
internet you're now seeing this life so
we talked about why are there two terms

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,160
that I need to make sure everyone
understands what I'm talking about when

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,380
I say that because I'm gonna say the
word drug talk about their I'm not

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,430
talking about like talking about a
substance that you put your body and

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:01:03,120
your staff is basically comedies drugs
take to increase this is no easy the

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,340
bball words are nerve transmitters in
your brain there are more than those

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:19,229
important can actually see the little it
was very blurry and that's why I'm so

11
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:29,060
you read roots of neurotransmitters in
your brain that we are things that need

12
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:43,810
attention to stuff and acetylcholine
stuff and most big deal with

13
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:53,850
norepinephrine and epinephrine is also
to be manipulated at most

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:04:08,819
and so every day

15
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:48,210
the whole high nicotine is mostly bad
for you it was consumed but if you like

16
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,710
to do that is also a nicotine it was
kind of surprised when I found out about

17
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,930
it that it actually does good stuff for
you to agree new team will improve your

18
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,340
fine motor functions period of time so
if you're working out something very

19
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,080
detailed and you're having trouble with
a little bit and then go back

20
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:28,799
it also doesn't last long as you might
know but another one big word that I can

21
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:40,880
never pronounced right so yes but I'm
gonna try and call it yes it is personal

22
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,270
and a controversial but seriously

23
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:53,260
be tested on dementia patient's health
education if you with Alzheimer's to

24
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:07,219
their memory is actually best source yes
and that was what I may go for a long

25
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:15,440
time they stop our range because the
disease down people don't like that and

26
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:32,250
it's not good for you find something you
want to take it don't go there was a

27
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:40,370
study found that if you combine it with
omega-3 fatty acids that has granted

28
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:51,180
there's three studies but so much

29
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,990
and are high on the list of things a lot
of pts and the macroeconomy internet

30
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:13,889
number one source one source of omega-3
and yes so terrible to prescription

31
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:23,770
drugs don't have a description for
prescription drugs were gonna talk about

32
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:38,750
them right now let me tell you don't
actually take pics are taken to it that

33
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:51,100
their hands are you right now I just try
to really good I totally prescription

34
00:07:51,100 --> 00:08:04,460
I didn't really I did you guys made it I
told you not to let these people and now

35
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:21,000
so is she basically whatever else you
feel like you were sleepy and say you

36
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,050
can't take it is like how you do parties
except for this is a pill and it tastes

37
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,690
better

38
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:49,880
possible it is yes so you don't have to
use it or they don't want to be sleepy

39
00:08:49,880 --> 00:09:00,700
and it's so you don't have that kind of
illegal to have quote cells later there

40
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,310
is a legal aid which is a French

41
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:20,029
model doesn't work as well and it kind
of makes you feel like we're actually in

42
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:32,450
the United States but you can find it
they stopped making me like 20 years ago

43
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:54,390
but people still get places yes it works
by making your brain which is basically

44
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:05,370
take is essentially he says I put out
much of this neurotransmitter that

45
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,480
doesn't get too

46
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,290
wants to do so tell us your brain like a
fine just let it do its thing and so

47
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,480
tell me gets to your focus on that right

48
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:32,839
crazy things at all at all is kind of
like Ritalin Adderall is made for calls

49
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,060
so they're not actually been easy but
they're actually means and it's used to

50
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,560
treat ADHD as he said and it works by
basically telling your brain hey all of

51
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,829
those neurotransmitters just do them
just as much of a mystery can and so

52
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:57,430
little trip that I learned it one time
you just get together and it helps your

53
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:06,920
brain me all of these neurotransmitters
and then also tell me about that don't

54
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,620
you as I'm not a doctor

55
00:11:12,620 --> 00:12:56,630
this is not a trick question back

56
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:35,860
Thursday night I was like oh shit remix
this weekend and so I stayed up all

57
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,960
night and presentation and I think I
still did the Dr office I love I love

58
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,560
how easy this

59
00:13:46,560 --> 00:14:02,140
ok so yeah it's called off its like the
parts of animals like the way and then

60
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,230
but maybe just like brains and
intestines and stuff like that it turns

61
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,030
out

62
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:22,670
does have all sorts of good stuff and
there's the GEC from breast milk is

63
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:45,329
bioavailable mean that whereas their
stuff in it that the system basically

64
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,720
you take it and people there

65
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,860
GCB is the reason that children develop
with their babies is basically they get

66
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:24,990
this drug from their mom on sale so that
is holding it now there's a day's drive

67
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:41,459
some kind of trying to hold an esterase
izzy is a

68
00:15:41,459 --> 00:16:06,758
you have too much you have too much does
it just raises so that you don't have

69
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:27,480
too much and don't do that so hopefully
that you take the top down

70
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:51,240
will make more

71
00:16:51,240 --> 00:17:03,420
raised hands so that you made of you
made a big Chinese mom because it's rare

72
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:15,559
and expensive so I'm sure there's others
but I know it's not expensive like you

73
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:34,950
can buy a bottle of pills I don't know
why I don't do it does all of this

74
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,880
yes yes

75
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,090
talks I'm sorry

76
00:17:43,090 --> 00:18:09,490
don't dance there are a lot and they are
nobody really knows how they were they

77
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:18,779
just had no they do really studied in a
way it's mostly just a lot of people and

78
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:28,230
say this is good so there are a lot of
them and they help you help you focus

79
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:35,080
and remember and they all they would all
work is slightly different ways but

80
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,070
they're all ugly similar site at all I
don't know a lot about them I've never

81
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,230
done them but I had to talk about their

82
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:52,559
does anyone have somebody stands

83
00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:02,158
last night maybe I don't remember

84
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,120
fly back again next year

85
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:19,219
New Jersey Devils New Jersey things like
Jim saying people over age or older

86
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:27,549
medicines there by pills at Walmart and
there's not a whole lot of scientific

87
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,668
evidence to support said he may or may
not work but they seem to kind of work

88
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:41,059
on a memory retention things like that
you like to try things and you want to

89
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:49,080
spend the money on something that you
can find him he's trying to sell but I

90
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,060
time I prefer to stick to their names
because it makes me feel like I

91
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:11,940
some things so no trophies are also
downsize its fine so downsized there's

92
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:27,830
probably more than this but secondary
changes her mind made up so so your body

93
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:50,010
and your body makes affects the locals
only other places I'm doing this if

94
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:59,690
you're taking a drug that's gonna really
really really increase your body time

95
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:15,320
for your body does so you can basically
unknowingly and unwittingly really cool

96
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,950
stuff your brain he didn't expect to do
which sometimes is great and sometimes

97
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:38,650
don't worry I'm so keep this one example
guy who was a professional bodybuilder

98
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:48,380
and used to take a lot of testosterone
injections in his body realize one day I

99
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:56,090
don't have to meet somebody just so that
when he started using testosterone and

100
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:11,040
so do the same thing so he takes a lot
of acetylcholine your body can say I

101
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,170
don't need to make it anymore and it
will really help your brain chemistry

102
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:22,420
problems that you will then have to take
other drugs and intolerance anybody who

103
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:37,110
does drugs and so that said I had a
protein for everyone don't take the time

104
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:52,790
I usually find the best two weeks three
weeks or try different words because it

105
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,600
lets you down

106
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:10,860
and then down cycle and it's great so I
knew I had to do something I'm trying to

107
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:18,010
learn a language or talk for Freaknik I
took a lot of drugs in my research for

108
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:35,860
the talk like that means I took drugs as
research for me yes that yes I okay so

109
00:23:35,860 --> 00:24:01,330
this is the first it is like taking
pills buy all hands on deck or she

110
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,539
basically I made this day that I took
twice a day and I think I spent like 30

111
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:12,809
bucks altogether on it something like
that so happy pills you can also drink a

112
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:20,520
tea but it's just taking those pills and
why all the ones that I have a lot two

113
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:28,480
milligrams of them once or twice a day I
don't recommend it but you should do it

114
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,730
so happy

115
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:47,790
you take off he need as we talked about
much much better and it tastes so those

116
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:53,668
two are there to provide you with your
energy and your house take hold because

117
00:24:53,669 --> 00:25:11,190
it makes your brain and use their brain
so you have something you have to build

118
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:21,720
it will meet you remember what you had a
question since you were things take this

119
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,360
is there any movies that are affected by
party we need more or less

120
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:41,409
no no I am you find out that is that is
is that is basically like this is a very

121
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,240
safe staff you take $200

122
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,840
speech and it doesn't work for you and
you say ok I'm gonna take $300 for a day

123
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,649
or two and see how it feels it's
probably not I can't I can't recommend

124
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:06,830
that with any kind of drugs not do it
don't do it and maybe it keeps killing

125
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:32,760
not gonna stop because he is like it

126
00:26:32,760 --> 00:27:02,210
yes yes your body size me how close are
given misleading we'll all get up sore

127
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:12,570
so I'm just talking out my ass right now

128
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,689
capsules in a regular little while to
get to you I don't know try it let me

129
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:28,940
know now it's a question to ask is how
talks are supposed to work you have a

130
00:27:28,940 --> 00:28:31,640
question

131
00:28:31,640 --> 00:29:03,490
yes

132
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:37,780
yeah I don't know how I don't know why I
know it works like I have taken

133
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:45,920
excessive amount of cash you need and it
definitely use all of the good and it's

134
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:52,200
like I'm just like really

135
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:14,380
the next day I like Tori Tori which
probably helps to basically like bill so

136
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,279
it's like being able to control the
levels of everything without all the

137
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:39,049
crappy parts of things

138
00:30:39,049 --> 00:31:50,639
yes just like her fantastic body to take
a bit like you can't just take shelter

139
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:56,360
and probably do something with it
because they are

140
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:08,040
but yeah like you so here is that there
are some sources appalling that your

141
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:28,210
body is a source for like an exhortation
to liberate it turns out that somebody's

142
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:53,470
where do we have other questions so too
do you have ideas about how to actually

143
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:43,220
and changes and yellow black and it
changes were collected outside so that

144
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,720
another another thing that I have found
it very useful idea is so the internet

145
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:58,520
and I don't I don't like a sarcastic way
but like there are forums on the

146
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,110
internet that is people talk about their
just like hey let's talk about how we

147
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:11,279
can make our lives better drugs and they
know what they are too kind of like

148
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,720
where they also know a thing or two in
the nation a lot more things so you have

149
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:25,029
to sit down and read stuff and parse
through what is and what is not

150
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,379
but you can learn a lot that is a good
place to find out from people they have

151
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:39,629
to abide by these drugs wrong and what
do you think about them like a dog

152
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:45,319
that's what people do with their
families and reviews on it and say you

153
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,119
can get pretty good if a lot of that
just kind of have to take some time to

154
00:34:49,119 --> 00:36:07,430
look at it and figure out there

155
00:36:07,430 --> 00:37:04,690
and so like things like solomon's
regulated and they are a very bad way to

156
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:14,640
where you can sell the sunlight and
you'll do that they are there any places

157
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,230
that are busted where they have doubt
that people were just like taking plants

158
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,900
from outside

159
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:38,329
people really very yes so no so there's
there's a regulation and regulations

160
00:37:38,329 --> 00:38:00,190
just telling people if you do this with
it is you know that's not too much as a

161
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:14,510
kid will do this and not in it may do
this but yes control obviously is there

162
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:21,240
so that stuff

163
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:28,069
but there's like you perceive things
like any of the other talk about you

164
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:54,030
have to look around and find a source
dried and the best we have anymore

165
00:38:54,030 --> 00:40:15,710
and make no claims it does anything but
better be going and that third party

166
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:32,710
utility companies

167
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:54,900
are small so something something that I
think about it till now to answer this

168
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:03,570
question about finding good sources said
all the studies on Amazon right just go

169
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:10,880
in and say to search for the highest
rated stuff I found it I found that to

170
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:21,410
be a good thing all my best sources that
I thanks and all the best because the

171
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,710
people that take the gifts are five
hundred people say yes I don't think the

172
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,240
other stuff

173
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:38,279
the internet somewhere
