1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:01:38,670
so

2
00:01:38,670 --> 00:02:38,520
earlier this year

3
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:54,570
2012 actively targeting USD 14 and
financial impact is really high so we're

4
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:04,480
just making your consumer aware of this
car but didn't really give us all to go

5
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:26,410
on there how to write so you know more
or less familiar plain simple so it

6
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:40,890
actually has its own tax tax on its own
category and the scene and September

7
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:52,390
2013 no really knows how long
development cycle was no prior to that

8
00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:00,929
words starting with the earliest
recorded infections of course this star

9
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:09,790
as many windows box is ann's

10
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,108
we're seeing with the way this press
been involving an advance in becoming

11
00:04:16,108 --> 00:05:19,560
more complex I personally wouldn't be
surprised if

12
00:05:19,560 --> 00:06:41,740
experience 2020

13
00:06:41,740 --> 00:08:48,820
because you know

14
00:08:48,820 --> 00:09:07,370
other part of the problem we're going
back to my place if this into this this

15
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:22,610
this pitches stories so

16
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:36,899
where we're seeing three million every
day the probability of getting infected

17
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:48,670
from tyson's twice as likely again so
again probably so it seems like this is

18
00:09:48,670 --> 00:10:12,800
at least I should write but so companies
is that

19
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,760
they they have third party they're just

20
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:30,890
foxnews.com CNN MSNBC to see an ad
posted by third parties who also knows

21
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:39,370
as for yet another and we gotta get this
cat needing a waterfall advertisement

22
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:50,430
but your hands up on her agenda but
these advertisements have been done in

23
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:58,550
half and then screen and so now all of a
sudden you got wishes scripts on site

24
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:06,359
and so Google started getting a lot of
sites and you may have noticed liking

25
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,329
search results back to search results
perhaps I have a screenshot of this

26
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,329
actually do my presentation just added

27
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:30,138
but scripts right you're perfectly legit
but then all of a sudden this site maybe

28
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,449
they contain malicious

29
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:48,839
because there's some scripts there that
could cause so and so far only to 300

30
00:11:48,839 --> 00:12:02,110
customers across the entire house movies
are passed down and asked him last fall

31
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:10,660
and then so in 2015 cedar keys alone and
help the health care industry comprises

32
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:21,110
about 36 percent of that don't be

33
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:35,279
so every industry is not you know the
findings industry manufacturing that's

34
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:54,890
being charged it thats why that is great
big money in this a single instance over

35
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:22,730
$250,000 and a million dollars has been
hey out

36
00:13:22,730 --> 00:14:11,920
presentation and and I think that's just
in his room house peace to you know all

37
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,459
my drive over Knox was more has gotten
myself like Microsoft and something

38
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:24,959
about this you know why we continue to
allow consumers to be exposed to

39
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:36,060
something like this why we give them
better tools to try to have been to a

40
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:44,170
couple interesting lately what was right
here in Nashville but downtown

41
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:57,660
information system security national and
this year one of the key no said we need

42
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,290
to raise accountability of companies
around secure software development life

43
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,740
cycle low around

44
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,110
taking care of the consumer and this
kind of this kind of problem that to

45
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,870
that statement I think that a lot of
ways you know vendors can be doing more

46
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:30,710
to help the consumer brands so close

47
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,450
startup script a locker in September 13
when it is this whole family which

48
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,020
included Creek Bridge Rd

49
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:56,340
crowd he wishes you know otherwise and
you know it's this this week most of my

50
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:04,670
research and studying on this and has
been around for awhile but this week

51
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:26,290
Tuesday so this is changing rapidly and
it's continuing problem

52
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:49,399
here's a list of antivirus products that
you know pick up on this and most of

53
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,440
this detection takes place after the
Christian actions but done so you you

54
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:07,309
know that point and kind of you know as
well if you have it that so here's a

55
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:16,418
little chart you're asking about
millions and millions here so damaged is

56
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:35,130
a process you know handle the second to
your IP addresses four hundred thousand

57
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:42,840
times infections and thousand different
dollars so just looking at this guys

58
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:55,370
would wear some observations of these
observations about 3,000

59
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:11,309
polymorphic yeah so I took this to me
there were four thousand samples code so

60
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:21,340
yeah somewhat of a bus trip in that it
uses itself but that many different

61
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:28,570
versions had been previews right and so
that was wider and then going back five

62
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:44,540
addresses to be the elevators all the
actual physical so I think the number of

63
00:18:44,540 --> 00:19:02,470
actors based on

64
00:19:02,470 --> 00:20:46,470
so well

65
00:20:46,470 --> 00:21:16,460
yeah the actual file types as well so is
based on you know the guys were doing

66
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:25,159
the moves on the ground and has been
from their observations been trying to

67
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,669
be just frustrating user so there's this
year then there's also this far down

68
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:37,940
here we are encouraging of the file
types then down your body to become part

69
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:46,630
of a large community dole so that when
the time came across as most recent

70
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:53,700
version has just been attributed to
frustrate these people as much as

71
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,269
possible so total jerk

72
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:27,749
so our communication and tour Swisher's
Torres it or not he addresses sandbox

73
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:28,619
where it is

74
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:40,149
browser variance covariance so is out
there now there's a walker that's out

75
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,889
there now and so it's just different
transmitter

76
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:59,089
desktop please tell me right so have we
talked about that there's there's a

77
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:17,690
magazine to you but basically a
ransomware as we can for open are you

78
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:32,470
know all the hardware itself we're
talking

79
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,890
so I don't get it you know they talked a
little bit about that earlier but the

80
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,950
number one factor

81
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:55,600
followed by explain their these
processes see screens this disguised

82
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:12,139
so you know how many people take resume
submissions by email because it's really

83
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:20,870
easy for someone just disguised there
there you know a lot to locker yet seen

84
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:27,530
as something else and by far he's
executables are screensavers that are

85
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:35,870
disguised as a dog or disguised and then
by default it was a it doesn't show you

86
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,158
file extensions right so you think
you're living in a file extension double

87
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:48,730
clicked on it you're running as local
admin now your user profile every locker

88
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:55,650
and then we'll get off get into some
were spreading from there here's a

89
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,860
little

90
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:13,419
no longer taking two populations and
smashing together yesterday somebody

91
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,270
down to one of the dogs like socks for a
dog to the point where they said will

92
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:29,049
hate me to pay us fix your problem
that's the point where users so they

93
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:37,299
could no longer so they see didn't
respond to the Remote Desktop Support

94
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:52,600
scam

95
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:30,840
so I'm sorry guys for ya no that's rude
over space this one so did that to ya

96
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:47,899
last three letters they have seen the
video file name would be like resume doc

97
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:55,920
docx and then but they're really
extension that's not a CER yeah yeah so

98
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:03,770
by default Windows doesn't show you the
file types

99
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:14,509
yes that's true

100
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:48,159
yeah i i process so even with checking
to see it this personalized

101
00:27:48,159 --> 00:28:06,149
potentially infected machines with the
past like virtual box so that this might

102
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:23,090
be a part of that why I want to get you
to action

103
00:28:23,090 --> 00:29:14,449
sometimes

104
00:29:14,450 --> 00:31:27,340
what's the problem here

105
00:31:27,340 --> 00:34:06,379
control your product key for the
encryption so this is for the ransomware

106
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,080
authors take some time now

107
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:20,560
and get you generous and send to be able
to you capture the products so and then

108
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:56,000
hijacked that try to do this so I'm
trying to go back and check he said he

109
00:34:56,000 --> 00:36:54,970
is not transmitted clients or so

110
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:39,330
and try to pay that price tones so you
know log management confused attacks on

111
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:48,779
this activity and as well as relations
services anomaly detection can be used

112
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:57,420
to text you know where you can contact
just like the phone contacts we talk

113
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:05,410
about their

114
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:20,730
and interestingly enough the season
change so help your computer files help

115
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:27,150
your violence or something like that
which is another way of trying to throw

116
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,180
people were saying this and trying to
figure out how to text

117
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:51,180
against it and also away so we can all
learn on these files and then shut down

118
00:38:51,180 --> 00:39:21,058
the system and network connection and
not exactly sure all of you can see the

119
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:34,819
source for a year or more specifically
skinnies and PowerShell scripts users

120
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:41,590
languages or directory

121
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:58,530
administration I personally like making
changes between Windows and Windows

122
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:09,270
administrator and what we can do our
show and some thats a result of things

123
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:30,600
like that and guys have heard me around
those tax and you're reading and then

124
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:44,000
because variance of 25 days and so you
know we're looking back and you know

125
00:40:44,000 --> 00:41:05,710
cascade backup backup backup and that
you're right now we're so your your

126
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:12,000
go-to you were get my back is is is no

127
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:33,580
so scared because you don't want that
schools and he's a very high schools and

128
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:43,210
what I meant by that was more protection
complete right each case so not running

129
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,420
as local admin provide some protection
but only for others data because he

130
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:59,770
looks for a file path you can write to
the drive and he ever connected to the

131
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:15,630
registry and that's cool does expand and
then there's speculation about becoming

132
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,800
even more

133
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:29,190
so that running as local admin does
limit the scope or running as well and

134
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:47,180
it increases the scope infections all
the dayton was so we'll get back to a

135
00:42:47,180 --> 00:43:00,890
date and does provide some protection to
talk about the invention is taking some

136
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:17,089
generation DGA to act against generated
johnny is right so it's ok this web

137
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:39,079
areas not something huge and then
locking that so that's

138
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,940
recommendations for some general stuff
over and write your own security

139
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:53,359
practices more specific stuff on the
right thing you've heard your security

140
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:14,538
guys you know you know you know things
like that you know I ever saw was

141
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:18,369
interesting because two weeks ago the
out behind came out and said just pay

142
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:27,989
the ransom because we don't really
really effective and we feel like you

143
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:42,190
have a good so yes we do

144
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:53,000
question I heard someone say yeah
alright so so don't want to fight the

145
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:13,090
man regular offline that we've always
always always trumps crash drive

146
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,740
reinstall

147
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:43,049
golden age and talk about what happens
if you don't and that is great service

148
00:45:43,050 --> 00:46:00,280
you check out her home where I think
moves quickly so sorry

149
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:24,810
yeah so right here this is gold against
my opinion against this threat so check

150
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:38,570
out software restriction policies and
that stops and works as a first-line

151
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:57,940
defense here are great for his work that
out

152
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:11,620
us in this situation so that your
Dropbox Dropbox awesome

153
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,990
their customers affected by this day
actually into Dropbox says restore

154
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:30,109
previous because they didn't help that
they could restore its all enterprise

155
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:38,090
was backed up you know that was until
they went with that

156
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:45,300
and so would have to call to say that
this point I'm just click on their back

157
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:58,590
and several years synchronization closed
box so drop by for the keys from from

158
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,130
these websites like this fire I just
burst you interesting laid off last week

159
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:11,650
two moro crypto arranged for taking down
the new keys up there so if you happen

160
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,340
to save your encrypted data you can
potentially go upload the file to their

161
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:25,030
and discover that now so as a last
resort hang on to your date on like a

162
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,350
hard drive them off my hard drive or
something like that because you're

163
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:33,328
taking down

164
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:43,890
but black she is remote access to a
black she got was in the news about

165
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:49,959
three weeks ago he's not even 12 weeks
in prison twelve 12 weeks twelve years

166
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:54,999
in prison for spying on women's reserve
webcam using black she's road access to

167
00:48:54,999 --> 00:49:00,288
those you got black shades got it
somehow got a bunch these women's

168
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:06,459
related emails or things like that and
he was fired on them through their left

169
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:14,140
hands and all she now and then got so
glad she's really really hard to remove

170
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:27,288
odors and black jeans and so late plate
say get your files off of their

171
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:36,150
can rebuild from gold as my
recommendation and these are going out

172
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:44,520
through the organizers so if you guys
look through these things

173
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:55,430
there but early reaction in his response
is essential that you can take an early

174
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:00,370
reaction disconnected from the network
to several clients hurricane season are

175
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:07,029
shut down your hard drive extremely rare
executables can be run user right locker

176
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:20,870
and then you can save your files and
that you know like I said law

177
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:29,370
enforcement officers and taking these
braids down all the time and so the

178
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:40,339
whole list of resources here with a
presentation and question is a real

179
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:55,140
quick love for the Knoxville area and
security LinkedIn Twitter and I'll take

181
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:29,360

personal use OpenDNS since they came out

182
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:54,500
they opened nasa's doing which is which
actually allows you to trace to their

183
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:14,250
architecture is gas has time to offer a
special on that the pay premiums so

184
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,570
