1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:13,900
and also hear a lot of the designers
have rely on early few readings instead

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:22,119
of more traditional strange because you
can actually make screams plastic using

3
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:34,940
that is on my last longer than three or
four classes and single action single

4
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,970
shot pistol called the number and
everything except for a couple rubber

5
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:53,750
bands and a meal plus extra watchers to
make sure it gets over the line of there

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,720
is actually in the law you have to have
a certain amount of weight in metal

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:10,200
again so into it set off metal surface
we don't want bill for sale in Duns

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:23,409
and just how did you ever had with
condom just in case you couldn't find

9
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:42,789
any office supplies the heart is a
barrel and the other side and pushed out

10
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:52,640
side every so yes and yes you have to
David Farrell off of the guys in the

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:04,479
process of getting to that he tried
putting in Maryland and is there wasn't

12
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:13,799
enough friction between the metal and
plastic barrel popping out of there and

13
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:21,450
I guess agency the couple extra nudge to
make sure that yes it was ultimately

14
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:40,940
from that 23 2010 22 Ruger 10 22 is
probably the most common 22 rifle out

15
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:49,260
there at the moment as the number of
yours every member for the most part the

16
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,298
receiver is the government considers it
done legally everything else is just

17
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:03,900
successor that's that's that's the part
that has the story

18
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,569
over that's when you buy that that's
when you have to go through a background

19
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,480
check all that fun stuff so yes he went
off and all the rest of it off the shelf

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:24,839
but you know according to the government
carol is not not not required and

21
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,090
similarly view women three Grammy

22
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:37,440
demo's this is my favorite designs
because he get around your stress issues

23
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:48,689
with that all of latin back and pulled
it together one of those really well

24
00:03:48,689 --> 00:04:06,840
that's a problem and beating her and
while you're reading for HW design and

25
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:15,389
here's a wonderful example of 3d
printing as a very useful for

26
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,440
prototyping this is another one of those
that I think if the guy got a deal and

27
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:33,699
started actually me back shirring hit by
that again this is actually a are three

28
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:41,030
supreme part is the lower and butt and
the top is standard off the shelves

29
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,128
ar-15 over

30
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:54,939
of design and just remember folks make
sure you get the 2800 so they have

31
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,809
little roaming so that it's not
considered a short barreled rifle as far

32
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:09,279
as I'm concerned is going to jail socks
and here's a diagram of all the

33
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:19,999
different base color coding pretty down
listening then looking at three British

34
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:51,879
stuff in the news lately this
monstrosity 320 and fire about 1,800 of

35
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:58,050
energy needed to launch a softer

36
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:10,860
I think it's about power because there's
no combustion technically this is not a

37
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:21,740
fire but stayed constant just recently
passed a law saying that guns are also

38
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:50,420
firearms as far as this is concerned I
have to look at work

39
00:06:50,420 --> 00:07:06,260
working at all

40
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:18,170
yes good morning that technology right
now we are really were his own as a

41
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:25,170
weapon they're just change and yes I can
go the twenty-pound rifle that's about

42
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:40,480
as powerful as a as you know Red Ryder
BB gun I'm expecting this season 2 I've

43
00:07:40,480 --> 00:08:14,860
visit Dragon Con this year by one vote
so cool and it's one of those contacted

44
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:25,200
me asking how much is that you can tell
us what you want is to me and they

45
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,770
initially built this just to show the
capability of metal 3d printer there's

46
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,889
been a lot about strength and all that

47
00:08:37,889 --> 00:09:02,850
we and the magazine ran through the
Stadion still holding up a lot about

48
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,899
$12,000

49
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,859
819 mass-market

50
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:18,999
$600,000 depending on a fracture so
again we're talking about a huge

51
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:31,559
difference is I look at the stuff that
he will have been doing for years and

52
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:48,529
years and years being and a drill press
is actually decided for some secrets in

53
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,660
the data silencer on there is why not

54
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:17,150
well check protect your children don't
want to pay the $200 she better and

55
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:43,590
doing cable or jail that is all these
things that are solvent trash for

56
00:10:43,590 --> 00:11:03,900
cleaning AIDS where it is really just
after they screw and oil soldier on

57
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:34,110
but then it becomes legal so don't do
that and you know how stupid simple it

58
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:44,990
is to make a firearm is just this is a
spring-loaded volt buyers from all over

59
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:53,470
the fire just push it into the channel
and it leaves the firing pin into the

60
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,630
primary says it all you have to do
whatever you have to do to reload which

61
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:14,420
changed our minds is is inscrutable the
other day also fit in because you hate

62
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:22,689
your team and your here's one that
actually

63
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:43,620
and also they found in India one of
those going to let you legal to own

64
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,850
firearms so he knows it done with you
using using it as a piece of the pie

65
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,740
being me to handle themselves and you
can see in this particular case which

66
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:13,270
gave me 120 to sell a shotgun shell
twelve-gauge

67
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:29,689
with the charges either read so I know
it's a classic that's about all we need

68
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:48,870
to drink player also has always been
fine if this guy build a shotgun and a

69
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,740
priest

70
00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:22,410
triggered everything is ready to go and
get this was just the actual

71
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,790
yeah yeah yeah

72
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:38,110
so heavy and talked about earlier

73
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:48,400
here's a better shot an AK 47 receiver
at it before it gets banged up you can

74
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,000
find these on the internet for $10 if
you have the ability to bend metal a

75
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,030
straight line

76
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:10,990
goals and you and I as a thought
experiment I have always been you know

77
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:18,580
the proper dimensions and bring it out
on paper and use that as intently why

78
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:35,920
couldn't he is and when I say medical
you know that sharply having to shed and

79
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:57,569
so he decided to copy and use them later
make any receiver and the bus stop

80
00:15:57,570 --> 00:17:07,720
yes yes yes yes

81
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:33,900
in this country together

82
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:41,950
oh well I never put a firing pin in it
so it's not so it was not functioning

83
00:17:41,950 --> 00:18:08,830
open old is trying to get to this point
yes I believe that stand magazine guy

84
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,470
said I'm not gonna build my channel you
just hold on to the magazine and again

85
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:31,630
you know to bring out I think again out
of it seems to be a very popular and

86
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:38,760
drill press and good oh and I think so

87
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,559
tire for the back of the group

88
00:18:44,559 --> 00:19:14,210
that that's the spring out of a popular
and that to me or or discounted and that

89
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:25,220
he just got without modifications from
you go wherever there is a joke

90
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:42,889
communities and vision and again a small
amount will come to your good way you

91
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:49,309
can find out how to build this on the
internet I'm not going to tell you we're

92
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:56,610
so close to home depot sale

93
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:18,919
yeah also one of those pts on how to
build a shed using doing so all day 46

94
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:43,309
pots and tell them together and that
you're not talking so I is so pretty

95
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:53,210
ar-fifteen you have to go through
background check and serialize are there

96
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:02,110
are people out there that cell where it
was called in eighty percent where they

97
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,639
have eighty percent of work as far as
the government is concerned it's a

98
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:24,070
paperweight with a drill or drill for us
have put the trigger assembly and all

99
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:36,389
that fun stuff and you receive that
should work

100
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:59,590
wow well there are many companies out
there that is their primary business and

101
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:14,659
I wouldn't say the wrong locations in
front of you and have ATF letters saying

102
00:22:14,660 --> 00:23:40,950
now so what they say on Tuesday may not
be the same thing on Thursday

103
00:23:40,950 --> 00:24:34,950
and machine shop at which point you
could build one out of a lot so well

104
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:43,790
with there's a lot of Companies House
very publicly selling these days with

105
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:57,790
ATF players I i've talked to guys had to
do with their agency was doing and it's

106
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,820
also an issue where there's a lot of
laws that we're down to you well was

107
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:11,500
legal and illegal is what the ACS says
but that's not how laws should work but

108
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:27,240
that's different and finally here's a
receiver and this one is going Wilson

109
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,420
are coming out with what they call goes
to her things you know when you're

110
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:42,750
giving us that need and the $1,500 even
get a little CNC machine that can be

111
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:51,850
dangerous

112
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,719
goes right now they're doing pre orders
are in the issue is they're actually

113
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:07,260
having problems finding that are willing
to partner with them because they're

114
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:14,080
they're they're afraid and political
backlash

115
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:34,789
204 and right and he has already have
people a box to come over and pushed the

116
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:35,649
button

117
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:41,479
know you're still so curious to see how
this works where they're selling the

118
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:56,529
tired she already setup program do it
and you will be able to use it as a

119
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:07,250
moral see you later on so $1,500 for a
little TLC machine not talking about a

120
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:14,539
couple different so I prolly gonna stop
wordpress.com they don't really tell you

121
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:21,720
they just a lovely repository of
pictures of guns that he found your

122
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:31,040
votes do a lot of pictures that show
came over and

123
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,480
they may even have some of the ones that
if you've ever seen some of the stuff

124
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:44,040
that the Pakistanis have made by hand
there there's there's a few of those

125
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:58,930
said you want to try to small parts is
worried is defense distributed as

126
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:08,030
potable since currently it is very slim
on information because of all the cease

127
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:14,370
and desist letters or trying to say that
you can actually produce this

128
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:25,939
information and dot com is a good source
that that's where I got the revolvers

129
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:36,740
songbird 22 and I believe they do have
you were asking about files to download

130
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:44,530
and I believe that you have no again
with also going on they had filed

131
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:53,070
yesterday they need not today cuz it's
Google as well with that on the internet

132
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,230
because England
