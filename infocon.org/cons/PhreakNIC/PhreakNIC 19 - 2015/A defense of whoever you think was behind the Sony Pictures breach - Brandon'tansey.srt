1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,029
hi guys welcome to a defensive whoever
you think was behind Sony Pictures

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,650
Entertainment Bridge Creek MI

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,340
my name's 2010 she was creepy for travel
and overnight for atlanta basically the

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,860
same as you're not around there

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:31,799
completely different geographic actually

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,660
a little bit first time of the jokes
about how to freaking means a completely

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:47,849
different thing kinda funny stories but
this was a team-high here now I know the

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,890
difference I can make that joke even let
just going to do about a year ago today

9
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:00,970
November 2014 pictures came into work
and saw this awesome thing on their

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,420
background on their desktops I will talk
about this image of it as I showed up

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,179
everywhere the background a little bit I
guess it kind of every presentation I

12
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:16,619
guess we will just go further into it
this far less actually kind of a few

13
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:26,100
inches of the pictures now where did you
see from where it makes me think of the

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,140
right nobody was hurt but it was never
actually exists but it's really a little

15
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,750
bit about it was something that make it
happen and I think from a secure first

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,599
found out about and they never received
the sample that somebody from a plan to

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,830
reduce the Atomic Energy organization of
Arab reported puters overnight would

18
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,979
turn up the volume and plasticity 600
based kind of life were easier that

19
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:02,020
really kind of cool to generally be the
complete opposite of this is the last

20
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,369
image that we are really hurting this
isn't the last image that we're gonna

21
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,750
talk about here is another one in Stuart
are going to be much harder to challenge

22
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:21,540
the other one of the street shops from
November 24 network also got a bunch of

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,319
weird stuff so far back

24
00:02:27,319 --> 00:03:10,769
trees and buildings which point out I
don't think it's a long time I pictured

25
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:17,180
a little bit better but we have their
Michael linden and he has to go down as

26
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,639
the co-chairman of the time I'm not
inspected thanks very much

27
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:29,530
$8 the co-chairman of the time the
briefs she's now gone ahead of Michael

28
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,199
Linden who is the CEO so up in the
purple is his guitar PC now the time is

29
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:48,290
a silly and then this message that says
hacked by GOP time

30
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,798
other picture to arches Google Sony
Pictures Entertainment mortgages there

31
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:05,379
will lead you into campus BC I guess
malware authors designers graphic

32
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:12,500
designer stuff tonight news but does not
exist really really cool part about the

33
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,389
breach any way of the images that I just
showed you the internet on November 24

34
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,489
2014

35
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:29,969
employees both phones there but I mean
in general interdict immunity from their

36
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,639
phones on the websites they were all
over the place just a few days later we

37
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:45,810
saw this guy flash so if you run your
chief executive still debriefing what

38
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,470
are you doing here comes as part of the
broader community FBI / in particular

39
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,810
has been very widely reported as I think
having us here is there anyway this

40
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,130
document if you read the whole thing
doesn't actually mention Sony Pictures

41
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,789
is kind of funny that they didn't cause
I got kind of obvious behavior that this

42
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:16,370
lists for the individual samples was
very similar to choose what we used to

43
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,960
be able to pull down from malware
samples to be able to do that for me was

44
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,159
excited because I like the kind of thing
that you would like to view this change

45
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:33,300
the saudi breach or kind of a spectator
sport to me for a bit of a single ashes

46
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,310
and lo and behold this is this year as
well so it's very similar images

47
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,500
but tony was on the right track right so
I tried them out when I saw this big

48
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,390
street john wants something looks like
you got them elsewhere and it was

49
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,570
helpful to have finally I finally got
something to which was convened a lot of

50
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:04,080
people started asking questions like
where security when your security

51
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,419
vendors something like this happens
internally keeps asking some questions

52
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,870
and externally start asking tough
questions what happened then the

53
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:23,840
internal question that he would be very
convenient I thought was the popular

54
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,159
question people like to point fingers
quickly and we'll talk a lot about that

55
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:44,640
right people want to know what sales and
say what's important to say you know

56
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,010
when you work at times like this you get
customers to what has happened to me how

57
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,620
the divested of all these questions and
more time with his customers even when

58
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,450
they're the ones involved I'd expect you
to help you want to write having the

59
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:14,349
answers so that's what I like this will
be the last time this was the first

60
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,950
flight of a presentation to all of our
self reports that anybody who wants to

61
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,780
find out a bit more right now we want to
kind of informed the movies hey what did

62
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:32,140
you happen to be what can we tell me
they have them and see how the show you

63
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,460
this particular kind of humor in this
was actually the title just to say I

64
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,210
really kind of following this all around
the clock display is really creepy and

65
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:53,460
some notes for those hoping to kind of
have 1 I'm kind of conservative person

66
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,120
when it comes to making claims right so
I was seeing some things he's things as

67
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,510
complete truth and that wasn't sure how
they were able to do that then she was a

68
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,520
lot of people trying to Costa Rica
reported his claim myself one person

69
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,700
says something that's kind of LSA the
New York Times says you know South

70
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:27,750
Africa was behind the attack and they
have those really Langley times reports

71
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,059
people they're taking a run with it and
the original lack of facts kind of

72
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,209
doesn't matter all this sort of thing
that but I'm not sure who here I'd wager

73
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,490
most of us are you looking for people
who are already been happening places

74
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:59,450
ok well if you don't I guess they don't
necessarily hard you just need to do

75
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,330
something that they either can't or
don't have the time to do right still

76
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,460
when you're doing a report on an instant
and easy to say you're the exact facts

77
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,230
and tell you nothing more than other
people in the room and these are people

78
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,430
who often hard to be able to do that and
that's kind of what the ones

79
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:24,540
presentations to be about

80
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:39,870
know this used to be history so he's the
chief security strategist fire I have

81
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,800
mentioned before they got so about a
month or two ago

82
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:54,490
shirts relevant securities Georgia ones
giving the keynote she did you know

83
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:05,660
anyway just the way they have one being
that they used to go to entrust their

84
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,449
projector was also given his keynote and
standing behind him twenty-foot image of

85
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:18,680
this kind of comment though because it
really we're just confirming John

86
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,199
picture of myself at least explaining
what that picture was so many in the

87
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,130
country at the time was actually
involved with the investigation of some

88
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:35,120
pictures along with you on this picture
itself is from using some kind of TV

89
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,170
show I guess I don't remember that part
of the story on stage with somebody who

90
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,170
claim to know you tired inside inside
story of the Sony Pictures beach this

91
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,479
person that all the new generation of
sharing he being involved with

92
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,660
investigations also felt that he had all
the information released a lot of it and

93
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,150
disagree with everything has to have a
say in this context it was great to be

94
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:12,089
part of the investigation is that it was
there

95
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:19,470
I went up to him and talked a bit about
something that bugs me is the fact that

96
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,449
I don't think there's enough information
out there to really actually I told him

97
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,120
that I asked have you seen any be
reading your blog post reports whatever

98
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:49,279
that accurately describe the situation
and then he would be so nice here today

99
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,339
the guardians of peace are expected
anything else you do not read the top

100
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:02,779
bio not paying attention but I don't
like to talk about is the fact that I

101
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:10,379
have no idea and the fact that I'd wager
that other people have no idea as I

102
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:20,300
mentioned that I gave a presentation
about those virtues like I'm going to

103
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,370
use this next year and we kinda cool
completely unreadable but the highly

104
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:36,439
popular one but two be no underlying
italicized it would it is believed to be

105
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:44,849
think we know this is a very important
to me but it's a very important

106
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,879
distinction when you're investigating
anything right this is kind of played a

107
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,860
huge part I think we're people's
investigations into something

108
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:08,399
covers some of the facts and some of the
timeline of the reach and then told you

109
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:16,800
last time you saw on the morning of
September 20 November 24 2004 team work

110
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,010
and saw these things in the tombstone
and all that stuff actually important

111
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:38,950
here are the links with your rose 35
whenever there's the day is going to get

112
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:59,149
a call but it's cool I can see another
one called the other attacks don't think

113
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,690
looking to repeat this is what we see a
list of the military and he's become

114
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,959
very important and we'll talk about them
in a little bit PC W L

115
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:19,829
the amount of lines in this one was too
there were 38 and presumably the names

116
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:26,849
of the files had claimed to storm so
tired and a little bit we got to

117
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,250
November 27 and November 27th was the
first time that we saw any of the state

118
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:41,490
at least not for real we saw a couple of
movies at the time unreleased sites to

119
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,440
see these movies because the first time
that we've seen the stands actually

120
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,059
really take right people say also just
do the stuff in this case

121
00:14:53,059 --> 00:15:02,618
actual bday that no one else has
happened before we get to designer furs

122
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:06,159
and this message at the top

123
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:12,899
internal data which is tens of terabytes
of the following address is he's made

124
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,089
use of confidential data links

125
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:27,459
really just like ross also learned that
yet and that man he saw this first

126
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,608
leaked

127
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:36,869
movies with 26 kids there's a lot of
employee information like names Social

128
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:42,099
Security numbers work histories
addresses all this sort of stuff I'm 26

129
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:49,959
gigs is right and only a few days later
actually what you want me probably isn't

130
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:56,279
that a little bit real hard to fake
again we're talking about separating

131
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,839
fact from fiction writer to have the
difference sucks so he must eat to live

132
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:10,499
juicy of that data I was really helpful
for us and then on December 30 saw this

133
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:19,449
kind of this one was almost made for
security researchers is contained a list

134
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:27,329
of all the passwords all these sort of
things I'm not sure why that's what they

135
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:33,839
leave but reminded us of how bad his
side as a replacement for other social

136
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,609
media services financial services
security certificates all of these

137
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,900
things got leads and actually became
really

138
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:52,230
because one of the popular little bit
circulated a lot of insider attacks one

139
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,570
of the reasons people look at you all
about their network only an entire

140
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:08,360
villages to complete the two departments
insider does not guarantee that is right

141
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,939
it was kind of proven here because all
of this idea right so this goes to show

142
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,839
that it didn't have to be something you
already have found this information

143
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:26,010
demonstrated that they did something
about this e-mail here to read the level

144
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:33,700
of the important part for you it's time
the wedding is this email is that this

145
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:41,660
would come with a legal question but I
still wanted to get out because we take

146
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,170
a look at the polls right above the ball
many things beyond imagination will

147
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,070
happen in many places in the world I
raisins find themselves a consistory

148
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,040
places please sign your name to the
company of the email address below if

149
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,980
you don't want to suffer if you don't
normally do with your family will be in

150
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,430
danger

151
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,830
legitimacy of the threats they send the
email israel denies the legitimacy of

152
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:17,020
the press let's say you were employees
only pictures to work something happened

153
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:26,200
to a business you can have dinner you
can watch a movie deal with your family

154
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,800
like this is getting threatened by
someone who demonstrated that they have

155
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,750
your address you know your personal
stuff it becomes a bit different writing

156
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,549
to make your computer

157
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:42,639
a lot harder to unplug and walk away
really investing so the next day

158
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:49,580
leaks and get to the end of the league's
part so don't worry but it's important

159
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:59,519
to continue to get more financially so
this will be the number of displaced 350

160
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,629
gigs hundreds of bank statements
financial rewards proficiencies

161
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:12,600
information and financial data on behalf
of Sony 250 gigs attackers could easily

162
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,759
say that they got tens of terabytes is
one of the biggest leagues as we see the

163
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:25,159
top finally a few days later another
kind of interesting because he's

164
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,590
attackers here indicating themselves by
the user including more leads of data

165
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:38,320
with their email an idea behind so sorry
we will talk a lot more about that funny

166
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,269
stuff as we go on but they began to
leave a bit more so here's the deal just

167
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:52,799
handed back after a 72 by a local
history File making about 70 goods

168
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,710
trading desk I'll post pictures and
another in moscow president sony

169
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,129
Pictures Television so much for 41 years
to grocery shop in the past year or so

170
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,350
and if you have you probably checked out
stealing is wrong and seeing the grocery

171
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:16,488
store I'll magazines lots of headlines
come out of this arrest he gonna be

172
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:20,460
honest with you the specifics are very
important for today but we see a lot of

173
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,240
people discussing the way that

174
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:33,660
and tom was talking about this kind of
trades on this build those relationships

175
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,470
they have with the town they work with
the first time we actually see one of

176
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:46,140
you tax bills that represent some kind
of depends heavily told us what they

177
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,800
wanted they just kind of keep doing they
don't have told us that they wanted they

178
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,620
told us that they've done something that
they want something with a bulging leaks

179
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:04,229
but these leaks around as a people learn
that for example 700 track record when

180
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:12,910
it came to issue notices of proposed on
censoring search results are getting

181
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:24,440
less good that is really funny pictures
again or leaks or personnel since it

182
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,080
came out

183
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:33,879
leeway and general counsel had leaked
with the promise of more understated to

184
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:43,860
come up with something to do we have
another six and a half games under cars

185
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,310
he leaves with the promise of more
interesting data the fact that this

186
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,460
point out that the state of keeping out
and studied for more details here

187
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:01,140
actually requested a tu

188
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,570
threats from these attacks they're
actually threatening to release the

189
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,220
email inboxes

190
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,309
the individual's rights not just the
executives not just in general council

191
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,720
members things like that but everybody
so you don't know how many people

192
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,530
actually email them you don't know
anyone to be don't know what their

193
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:31,149
goalless but there was a listening
communication with various bodily

194
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,360
December 15 why was the wrong where
class action lawsuit by Sony Pictures

195
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,770
employees who gets to choose it's kind
of hard to defend against the lawsuit

196
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:47,010
like this you've got the memo written
that says you are accepting way too much

197
00:22:47,010 --> 00:23:00,360
risk by writing policy to the fact that
people don't actually in the class

198
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:07,668
action lawsuits just got settled for
millions of dollars not the way to to

199
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:13,280
give us and then finally one of the last
week's actually the first one mentioning

200
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,270
the inter rights are not sure what he
may remember has been going on how

201
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,179
closely followed it the people have been
talking about North Korean talking about

202
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,850
the interview by obviously but this is
the first time that we actually see the

203
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,490
attackers mention something important to
threatening physical violence they think

204
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,030
it wasn't done the first time but now
there's any to remember the 11th

205
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:43,510
September 2001 we recommend you keep
yourself places at that time and you

206
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:52,190
better leave the FBI again but as a
result Sony Pictures announced that they

207
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,380
were going to cancel the initial
screening of the interview were

208
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,279
speculating the new york times actually
behind

209
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:28,129
later we suspect and North Korea to be
behind this attack as an usher who

210
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:31,468
remembers a lot of sites that we're
going to stream is it to get it right

211
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:38,849
with you to play and then the Sony
branded website hosted by now I'm not

212
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:46,189
sure the right term here but there was
blood on the service or anybody in the

213
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:54,299
box and sure enough immediately after
people have posted this journal this

214
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,680
movie too was lead against the context
of everything

215
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:07,090
with that we talked about the Tigers
Tigers and tens of terabytes of data to

216
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,689
say if you refuse to interview

217
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,400
gonna do all these terrible things we've
got someone to come in contact us

218
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:27,430
leaving you know you want to see that
again at all but the thing is supposedly

219
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,750
we're not looking forward to happen and
then decided to call it a day at least

220
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:41,440
as far as we know this is a town that I
want to avoid multi about why just a

221
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,910
moment hopefully I think the actual
background but the problem with that

222
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:57,970
information technical right now we want
to look for talk about somebody there is

223
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:06,850
no need to point fingers in terms of the
bridge and that's kind of cool but when

224
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:21,000
do with this attorney I kind of made up
I think I shocked shocked shocked

225
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
attribution

226
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:37,580
TV shows over anything like that and see
one or two things and based upon some

227
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,970
dogs and they find their killer that's
kind of cool

228
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,679
fictional character if you're right or
wrong just see it as a good thing about

229
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:57,090
fiction but sometimes I just managed to
track them doesn't mean they're actually

230
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,709
supposed to be in the kind of the money
comes to attribute any sort of computer

231
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,960
right especially like the same here when
you're on the outside looking in

232
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,440
talking about business right company as
well as the FBI infrastructure

233
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:22,880
a bit more now that he knows exactly
what happened and something interesting

234
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,620
that came out of that is this year
earlier with crowds driving north to

235
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,629
threat intelligence firms in India
security to let your phone from Dmitry

236
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:46,900
Dmitry definitely definitely north korea
aside from that murder as a side note I

237
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,470
can find out what he was asking about
president but that's what I needed he

238
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,590
says we are very confident that this was
not an attack masterminded by North

239
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:07,590
Korea that one of these is true is not
going to tell you which should make a

240
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,820
joke after that is to say these are
companies that users right these are

241
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,450
people who put a lot of research at
night I assume this despite that and

242
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,710
despite both of them to give them the
benefit of the doubt having refused to

243
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:29,539
say what they say they disagree right
and that's ok disagreement is ok just

244
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,429
meet there clearly isn't enough evidence
out there to find know with absolute

245
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:41,270
certainty what you know there is no
actual ground at least one of these

246
00:28:41,270 --> 00:29:40,940
groups is wrong

247
00:29:40,940 --> 00:30:07,270
there is a crisis yeah I asked him to a
certain way

248
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,730
Brian chris is a very popular blogger
and journalist when it comes to

249
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,380
different time and he was standing in
milan also just pointed out one day that

250
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:23,570
the top here is reaching out of the
citadel someone found a street corner by

251
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,070
Brian Krebs for personal use only I love
my job as possible it's possible this is

252
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:37,520
some crazy like that really did make the
citadel know where to go into that but

253
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,170
it's highly unlikely anyone with
anything that they want now that they're

254
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:53,750
as it was when you're making Windows
binaries this thing called the PDB PDK

255
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:07,890
Visual Studio 11 years ever runs trains
excusable you might see inside they will

256
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:15,510
see something like a website that had a
healthy clip in a bunch of people use

257
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,690
this as he did with you

258
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:34,550
to make their PDB that they'd like to
use your rules mister that's right they

259
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:49,820
might be helpful but you never know
anybody to say hey it's kind of silly so

260
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,879
when it comes to after you should I kind
of have two types of attribution and you

261
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:02,330
I guess degrees and how will you be
treated it's 102 group actions to a

262
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:08,850
particular actor owner without knowing
that her right so let's say you know

263
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,540
your your honest the soccer game over we
get a handful of fishing all those

264
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:22,320
emails have a very similar similar set
of characteristics that people can be

265
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,220
helped but I think the same people did
all these things and I think I know

266
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,050
exactly what's behind the keyboard
that's a good thing to do especially

267
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:38,919
when you don't have the ability is
difficult to do that as well but also

268
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,480
worth mentioning are different standards
of right so let's say can I work until

269
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:54,230
somewhere and we have our own that's
cool like that here and I think and then

270
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,700
I love him to the website as I think
Brandons media

271
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,090
pretty high right it's not definite
proof that he did it but it's a

272
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,720
reasonable suspicion

273
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,620
the next day brings a lot harder to have
a real defensible position right

274
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,979
something that can say no I can possibly
prove it was him that's a lot harder to

275
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:28,880
do something I don't want to be clear my
goal is not to tell you who do this but

276
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,720
I don't think anybody really tell you or
not done a good job of proving I'm so

277
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,100
this example here is one much like what
we're just looking at in terms of

278
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:45,520
silliness you want to keep using that
might be relevant to a pointing the

279
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:55,750
finger at North Korea earn a paycheck in
terms of what somebody

280
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,420
Korean language thank you ok I was
getting so yeah the language of the

281
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:10,740
Resources section this binary is that
his career right onto this kind of a

282
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,408
dangerous way this is one case where
people who should know better

283
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,040
allowing you to dispense right because
this is one of those cases where I

284
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,340
simply report the facts as they have a
language section of the spiders career

285
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,610
that spanned by know that it really
shouldn't much and don't mention it

286
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:35,800
becomes a bit of a sort of thing today
buddy to say that they're really not a

287
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,280
good sign of anything when you're
looking for

288
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:48,280
really strongly defensible finally but
we're gonna talk about the people just

289
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,129
say the malware is important to
distinguish is that there are actually

290
00:34:52,129 --> 00:35:05,220
two different so for example the company
posted on the internet before never

291
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,740
looked into the breach unless you might
not know if anyone can being recognized

292
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:23,540
text actually because / writing from
that FBI flash you would have never seen

293
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:29,740
the image the image on the right people
completely different number by the way

294
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:39,709
that picture comes from this reflects on
your machine but sometimes the schools

295
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,869
so that image and play the Web File
gunshots

296
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:51,980
actually bit different actually pretty
interesting to me it wasn't included in

297
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:57,940
the flash in addition it was until after
the news broke that we saw the sampling

298
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:04,950
and I'm not sure about this that trend
Micro I was actually the first person to

299
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:10,419
the first group that had mentioned that
second training samples that's kind of

300
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,069
weird

301
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:19,450
us-cert the USS response times after
regional committed to a more thorough

302
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,779
investigation you might see the flash
immediately following the December mid

303
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,579
December that they posted their analysis
I think December 19th with the day after

304
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:36,400
I get my first presentation and the
bunch of 2010 aware that we actually see

305
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,630
what they call the lightweight back door
and they referenced the next slide in

306
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:51,720
the notes which are kind of visible due
to the different types of samples out

307
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,359
behind see what they never actually
records that were the ones that trend

308
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:05,788
Micro interesting to look at these three
seven of them on the top three top three

309
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:10,190
choices that were used in the second
infection shame in the first infection

310
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,140
chain which was the ones close by the
FBI now the second set of my puter as

311
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:21,339
the second three which is weird because
they never mentioned

312
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:30,930
in addition to that for the first three
for the second trip you mentioned a

313
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:38,308
little bit bizarre because they are
aware he's never confirmed they never

314
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:49,989
told us about social too weird if you
submit something tomorrow I get the lead

315
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:59,059
resourceful is actually to my knowledge
that second set but if we look at this

316
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:02,700
list of caches and I'm just going to go
out on a limb and assume no one

317
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:10,598
recognized but there has that freezing
out what they are listed that not a

318
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:21,289
single friend take for me to Apple's

319
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:31,089
has actually come along and we can see
on the bottom is one of those times of

320
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:35,119
homework properly under lock and key but
the first few samples made their way up

321
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:43,589
there is the question is even after here
they they weren't seen as allied were to

322
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:48,650
describe the destruction our samples
that drops free shots and one of the

323
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:56,710
items like to talk a little bit about
them now where did the best that came

324
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:06,039
from Trend Micro been pretty cool to
pick the second change what they found

325
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,690
was the one that dropped the screenshot
with the tax as what we see here is

326
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,789
someone who runs this file it drops
another copy of itself

327
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:17,370
drops three more copies of it

328
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:23,710
generally not environment 17 copies of
itself to keep executing them but this

329
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:29,880
one to three things one can begin to
skin other hosts never thought it could

330
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,740
reach me shares to try to authenticate
to them it deleted the files on the

331
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,819
computer and it deleted the MBR again

332
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,530
destructively was kind of the name of
the first infection shame in the second

333
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:50,120
check infection Jane parted ways here
the first one dropped a little drunk to

334
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,020
web server without scrolling text that
picture with no words on it and then put

335
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:00,370
its own words over and presumably this
is what they were trying to effect

336
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:06,109
service right web server and see this
because the second one just run a

337
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:15,000
background check the background to get
there by

338
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,890
never actually a reference that second
change but was kind of cool breeze of

339
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:41,710
the things we saw in the chance here one
cool in the letter here as we see led it

340
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:51,840
was a fun and easy password 123 which
was a middle of my bed ask you actually

341
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,160
used to spread within the right hand
side BC he said

342
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:07,598
black and green blinking text you see on
the right foot it came out to say was in

343
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:15,640
saudi pictures of actually using these
private action they were actually

344
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:23,770
appended to the end of one of the files
as the fuck this out to see that had

345
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:31,299
more credentials and coated with itself
and also led filename nineties again

346
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:36,119
this is one of those things that kind of
people reference to suggest that it had

347
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,470
to be inside and infrastructure but we
go any kind of disagreement right he

348
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:48,220
doesn't mean anything about it being
actually inside soyuz brings us back

349
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,149
around to the right so I i dont wanna be
here it's very unlikely given the

350
00:41:53,150 --> 00:42:00,069
context was referencing but the quote
says thank you back to cited by Cody to

351
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:03,950
justify agencies continue suspicion all
the evidence of the attackers IP

352
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:15,279
addresses now the first year describing
IP addresses both you just set your

353
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:20,490
records location of the computer was
kind of funny but realistically is

354
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:28,459
probably no case of publication of
stress the importance of IP addresses

355
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,140
when it comes to attribution right but
the problem is that was really

356
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:37,328
particularly to a player here we have to
host one of the great smiley face

357
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,430
we have infected with malware

358
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:48,910
smiley but hey it's cool I said
traditionally or typically looks kinda

359
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,339
like this right you have an infected
hosts that reaches out

360
00:42:52,339 --> 00:43:00,710
control server response back to the
command and that but as this is because

361
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,819
it tells us that the attacker was
actually involved in that he doesn't

362
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:10,079
mean much of command-and-control servers
actually compromise your regular hosts

363
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:17,059
came back to put the commands

364
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:25,309
that's why you know I work and that's
what but a little bit different he said

365
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:32,969
sure where to send a message to a
committee control server but right now I

366
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:38,130
found this out because when I first
where I read it I had an analysis

367
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:42,329
network but not connected despite the
fact that there was no internet access

368
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:49,450
it try to server failed then it just did
everything anyway the machines I put it

369
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,288
on the ballot papers the imaging Davis
the backdrop to try to put forth another

370
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:59,829
internal the hosts but again that
command control doesn't actually tell me

371
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:05,960
that that right

372
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,180
pointed at me and my musing about where
you as a friend like me who knows

373
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,419
nothing about fish red hair was long
calling his accuser's potentially right

374
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,079
because those outside would actually get
to see whether or not that traffic was

375
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,900
received and responded to attacks so for
example are to be directly addressing

376
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,119
the malware found discovered

377
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:40,210
that's not true because you wouldn't
have any knowledge actually responded to

378
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:46,009
prove they were actually

379
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:56,960
tribution the key provision it is not a
good price is not just don't seem to

380
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,589
want to talk about the community showed
you a handful of emails earlier most of

381
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:10,589
those working how they try to prove
their authenticity but not all of us

382
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:14,480
here is a head wound from I think was
the first church that says Sony Pictures

383
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:26,549
hikers Sony Pictures hackers say they
want equality as possible so we see this

384
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:35,660
happen and then to continue the article
we get this year down the network said

385
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,589
that they are working for equality
suggest that their attack was assisted

386
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:41,509
or carried out by Sony employees

387
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:48,029
the verge a person identified as writes
something here actually is part of the

388
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:52,999
things that started the whole or the
whole inside her theory but if we only

389
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:57,058
see that kind of not because you can
read this whole earth is actually kind

390
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:02,640
of interesting but there's a problem
with other staff with similar interests

391
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,839
to get physical vector mention stores
but let's take a look at what we have

392
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,038
highlighted it says here that question
isn't open account which allows anyone

393
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,400
to enter your password

394
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,960
that means it's possible the message was
no relation to the attack itself as a

395
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,569
little problem out and even more
problematic this message when that this

396
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:29,250
is not something

397
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:36,300
reporters world where they got the email
as soon as legitimate as reported by

398
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:43,810
those guys get actors community and then
actually take a look at this again this

399
00:46:43,810 --> 00:47:06,450
is the happiest initial data does it
from the back what we see here is a

400
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,629
system that will receive email address
below two millimeter typing that a

401
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:15,390
military look at him northern Asia is
made for like one time use disposable

402
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:24,640
teens to sign up for weird services they
don't have the same further not only can

403
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:33,650
read his email information and I read
the email that was sent to one of these

404
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,510
accounts

405
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:49,570
dot dot dot com as I says hi my name is
Antonio me too so I also responded from

406
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:59,360
a couple questions one did anybody
respond to you did you go to anybody

407
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:18,930
account and no nobody offered any sort
of thing that can be talking to me they

408
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,830
don't know

409
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:28,040
the people take this is gospel to
publish what they say something that I

410
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,320
want to reiterate and we actually talked
about it a little bit about a little way

411
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:39,510
through as I mentioned the interview
publicly until December 16 right whether

412
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:48,290
or not they knew the whole time the
republicans don't know right and beyond

413
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:59,120
that WikiLeaks who conveniently host the
archives in a way so we see the email

414
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:06,160
that was sent to the executives in boxes
by Michael Lynton scale anyway from some

415
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,009
weird 1973 @ juno.com said we've got
great damage by sending pictures of the

416
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,790
compensation

417
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:22,080
monetary compensation for the damages
will be very well we never make you

418
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:28,710
better behave wisely from God according
to peace but it's actually kind of

419
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,960
important as you can tell if we look at
this screen shot that was actually

420
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,760
dropped by the first infection chain the
one that dropped web servers you see

421
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:46,080
this message highlighting what I want in
the Redbox get you say thanks a lot to

422
00:49:46,080 --> 00:50:02,860
go to these groups I don't know about
trying to try to add complexity

423
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,880
I'm just trying to arrange that

424
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,420
taking with them running for some kind
of her own worst enemies

425
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:26,650
a message that says GOP attack because
by GOP work so we don't result

426
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:34,210
investigation we were doing with your
own eyes closed and people kind of

427
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:41,240
hungry there's a lot of my favorite part
of his PSU

428
00:50:41,240 --> 00:51:00,129
presumably still saying these things in
person to its crazy but this is not

429
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,270
something that makes sense

430
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:17,360
David Cameron junior Alyssa not show
that people are investigating to do that

431
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:25,570
now just because we have to be
suspicious don't actually know that it's

432
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:36,230
very possible that it was right up
against a cleanser and there are so many

433
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:43,050
of them you to search GOP on peace and
you get a bunch of kind of cool how to

434
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:53,250
get all the internet because technically
click the link you would have got the

435
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,800
video that dream about three minutes of
this music

436
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:11,310
high-pitched music from your years ago
anyway this is that people are taking

437
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:20,180
this information using this building was
just doesn't make sense to do so here

438
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:26,029
again we don't have access to the actual
network traffic that took place but we

439
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,340
do have a few things to take a look at
one of the most amount we discussed you

440
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:45,450
that addresses here they were not a day

441
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:58,160
88 leave my email is open service any
money to read and respond why would you

442
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:10,060
do that because we want to create
significant seriously and reported by

443
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:16,390
far the least investigation so I want to
point out that it's possible there's

444
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:21,680
some crazy verifiable signature in there
to prove you don't get the information

445
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,200
presented here

446
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:37,770
questions are answered as possible
preferably to be made but they have now

447
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:48,470
whether they feel the need to prove not
gonna clear not specifically I just

448
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:52,990
don't think there's nothing there three
of us to come with a dependable

449
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:58,700
right I reference the difference between
a real attribution and I think there are

450
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:05,419
plenty of reasonable attributions I
don't think there are any further

451
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,300
reading

452
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:16,560
there's two lines here that will get
into the majors but I found out as a

453
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,369
friend like an entertaining blog
magazine

454
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:24,660
really well as it happens happens
something up there was the league's most

455
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:33,060
popular communications addition to that
post until the same time around is

456
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:40,910
revisiting this presentation and more
kind of high-level so if you're

457
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:50,720
interested you take a look at where the
tax IDs and assemblies will look to

458
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,118
China I want to do this talk but it just
didn't seem like the appropriate thing

459
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:18,440
to discuss the questions but I first TV
interview be remembered by all of us

460
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,859
release and not the kind of surrounded
the reach as a thank you

461
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:39,130
trauma I will link to my slides with the
notes on her but thanks
