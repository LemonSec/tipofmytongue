1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:19,930
good to see ya oh alright I'm into you
grab at seventeen years I want to talk

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:32,640
about education in our program recently
was brought it to a washington D C to go

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,699
to the white house we actually want
number one in the world

4
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,690
target MIT

5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,690
innovation system in 2011 were named
Computerworld laurette and occasional

6
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,568
school they came about two years ago
most kids go there and it's kind of

7
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:59,569
funny because the average kid that lives
there between 17 and $25 an hour nice

8
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,489
pretty good kids that are 19 to 21 years
of age

9
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,370
brilliant way to see a big into soccer
today justice works it works

10
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,190
don't just winging good

11
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:24,729
let me ask you guys were waiting how
many of you guys we can see here sale

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,900
and I want you to be honest no be
embarrassed by what other people would

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:35,430
you think that your computer is in your
own way in your own way and and here's

14
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,300
the kicker you got a black or a lot of
the other places that I and no one ever

15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,060
considers herself an expert because
their computers are so diverse today

16
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,270
that you've got everything that's out
there so as an educator in 1999 when it

17
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,030
first started at the school they were
saying you know what to make computers I

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,340
love when is it was very very basis and
then if you go to the progression that

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,210
we've had over the last fifteen years
the biggest thing is now how do you

20
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,330
teach computers while the biggest thing
is a lot of him say good for your degree

21
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,420
how did you guys have a computer sized

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:24,530
okay and you know when you look at
degrees today what you're actually

23
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,720
looking at how much I trained myself and
how much they trained me and micro dirty

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,030
jobs actually were staying which case
I'm not here tonight universities and

25
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,040
community colleges what's happening in
technology day is when you're not seen

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,070
the value behind I T people in what they
want on their own

27
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,220
talk about the programming languages
that are out there you say it's ok I'm

28
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,800
going with

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:24,880
go back go to off just a backup moved it
over the years is our school to you

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,570
right way now our universities and
community colleges teaching right way

31
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:37,290
they are not so many more like MIT
Caltech got before him was from Georgia

32
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,269
Tech and I think dirty a better way to
learn computer science and explain their

33
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:50,400
homework computer history is an
important you know whenever you walk in

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,360
computer science class they start
talking about computer history and what

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,620
happened in 1960 1970 1980 and the next
thing you know you like your history

36
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,600
class are you can wait for some laughs
and hands-on most people are gonna be

37
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,799
hands on mars anyway so what do we need
to teach we need to focus on lecture

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,650
what's happening in an industry where we
need to be produced system

39
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,090
administrators programmers database post
09 yours and we need to focus on

40
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,179
hands-on I'm going to do about it

41
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,840
regions when I'm talking to my balls in
his place in those photos you know I

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,799
went to him and i said i want the
freshmen students to be familiar with

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,300
the same reason I want this to take
place as the senior students can educate

44
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,669
and when they do this it's going to
produce a round robin effect where they

45
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:56,440
see everything to me three times now you
know about Middle Tennessee State

46
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,770
University in this is all going to tie
you gonna make sense in just a minute I

47
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,609
went over to MTSU we didn't cash why do
we did it with the Department of

48
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,380
Homeland Security and when we did this
all these folks will come in handy and I

49
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,699
was going around us talking to people
that I was asking where you go to school

50
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:22,120
what do you do realize what people say
it's easy canceled

51
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,389
you know and I've been doing this for
twenty years whatever what we had

52
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:34,990
actually set up a bar bilities we're
sharing else works alone had no

53
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,289
passwords we had makes machines that
were sent over to the side of the head

54
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,710
and then we have some more hardened
servers that went with that and we

55
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,630
actually have flags needs one of you
guys

56
00:05:49,630 --> 00:06:00,490
anybody here ok result in what I got
twins when I was younger because it's

57
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:15,510
all walked and I was waiting to hear
people say you know this is not a big

58
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:24,110
deal during the capture the flag and
you'll see the switches in the servers

59
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:40,810
in a way but the guys that had long time
of course I would connect to the network

60
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,570
and they started bringing this would
happen is of course it does it continue

61
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:55,120
so immediately you have people that
started with they minimize those windows

62
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,140
so the next thing you know if they open
up another terminal when they start to

63
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,360
see if they have connect to you might
start paying us which is being serviced

64
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,480
trying to see you look down there and
one guy literally has helped you like

65
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:23,850
but what he did was he started sixth
article bit servers and what to partner

66
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,470
with your IP address and when he started
playing it over and over again

67
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:37,680
IP addresses and he was dogs attacking
his body had asked I got next losing

68
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,440
connectivity and he started working and
then I got a hundred people with big

69
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,580
windows open they're just one another
and i'm looking at all what's going down

70
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,109
there are costs and their sales they
could walk past words once we arrange

71
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,070
that I want to have one of the people I
work with it does work for the Homeland

72
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,270
Security says I hope that will be ok
this sort of the bands for twenty three

73
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,880
core that simple

74
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:21,950
the server's name is this the flag is
under this folder so we had actually ok

75
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,960
USB Drive and it will educate and copied
off their you could have a flag true

76
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,978
stored true story anyway

77
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:43,880
there is my Cali Linux the YouTube
whenever they were this is what's

78
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,430
happening with education today I think
we actually want more from one another

79
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:58,589
and I'm just being sincere but I'm gonna
tell you how we have structured they

80
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,370
were right in just a minute

81
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,410
nobody even scare the network into a
total scam the network you may be able

82
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,610
to minors and then we were actually over
them with the tools anyway nobody even

83
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:17,170
used very same place to really going at
least I'm some anyway this is how we're

84
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:27,930
set up for hours waiting when you walk
into this game it's important to two

85
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:40,310
hours a day like I give you a break we
like sure you get to know the hours a

86
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,599
week and your help we talked to the all
the senior guys reopen the junior guys

87
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,279
and then as a senior guys great way they
get jobs in those guys become senior

88
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,819
guys they're helping each other so they
do this stuff over and over again they

89
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:01,370
have two hours of homework study time
and they have projects to the community

90
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,320
you know we've

91
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:11,490
reaction which was i've the steak
volunteer work with United Way and

92
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,590
police departments and sheriff's
department and just whatever nonprofits

93
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:22,700
hours things out we would save your work
or just labs you're not going to work

94
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,510
with layers receiving letters that are
in the plan work and go to school

95
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,590
network you know we've got 20 notes
downer but we also need help with those

96
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,540
forty students and 12 note you also have
this thing called student body was

97
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,150
student body that enjoys laptops
netbooks have people coming and they

98
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,260
look like some kind of futuristic being
whenever they open up their back you

99
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,340
don't know what's going to Best Buy's
exploding anyway so they take about five

100
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,920
thousand different note our school and
as they as they do this I just believe

101
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:12,439
every college community college where
they need to have that he's 19 1903

102
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,900
science and English next thing is that
we're not teaching people's computers

103
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,720
fast enough you know what's going to
happen when you get your four year

104
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,100
degree what did you learn your first
year outdated technology technology

105
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,770
that's dated so what you're really horny
in your junior and senior year is really

106
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:42,030
what you gonna be doing are you hope to
be doing that said they had to work or

107
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,230
school students so they want customer
service phone now there are starting to

108
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,900
hurt when we go out to these large
universities and that say you know we

109
00:11:51,900 --> 00:12:02,209
got twenty times this really happening
is back in the dorms are actually doing

110
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:14,050
anyway and they need a two hour or even
six hours away is just not enough way so

111
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:21,719
we took off and we started to really
because we're doing these labs and we're

112
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,850
doing everything and then we started
having employers if we leaving atlanta

113
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:35,250
and we know where they're coming out
saying I want to be when strolling

114
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,650
across but this moves over to the
workplace to name one place you know

115
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,959
what they want they want the new guy
amount of money which one year's

116
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,630
experience

117
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:59,860
the thing that we've lost his mentors
yes we go into a place because how busy

118
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,090
it is now with mobile devices the
complexity to switch the complexity of

119
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,590
cloud computing and and the servers
things that we have because most of us

120
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:16,800
are understaffed even when they say the
new guys review becomes dad when should

121
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:26,479
really be made until everything and
there's a new you know and their new you

122
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,790
gotta remember we're trying to get yours

123
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,750
ITV the new guys assigned to you are
trying to order twenty years experience

124
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,870
for forty grand you're not going to do
it and we also try to tell the people

125
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:52,740
working at heights he was being patient
with the guys you know or you're doing

126
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:02,240
or when you're speeding up that we need
to stop in train those people anyway but

127
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,200
the other thing that we need to do

128
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,920
moving into the security side of
everything is focused on security now we

129
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,300
need to expose students to hacking tools
now 70 years ago and went to my boss and

130
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:29,000
i said im like shark in the network use
let students do that

131
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:43,770
really going to make it back alright
network control network logo and the

132
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,370
reason being is Wireshark not only exam
date and protocols and those kind of

133
00:14:49,370 --> 00:15:10,300
things like passwords and yes my bosses
you know this sounds like a good deal

134
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:30,069
missus about some focus and say whatever
you want to do so

135
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:40,360
the reason we need to teach you about
how to break

136
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:49,310
more fun but it also means in 20
students experience just like all

137
00:15:49,310 --> 00:16:05,800
through things like radio this mess with
you and that to one another we do it but

138
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:17,329
they need software and they need to
understand about things a security but

139
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:29,810
then I mean just some of the tools
they're great break I'll try to keep

140
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:42,380
control in one day we've got them
something to do whatever we're teaching

141
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:50,230
them now and they sign the form they do
everything from blocked a break into a

142
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,160
car and you know that she's so many
things that we do you know our

143
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,449
organization needs to spray were always
there is a lack of her out there why

144
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,890
there's such a need for security

145
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,079
well we better start meet or she owes

146
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,010
colleges and universities I'm not
talking about and have a little like

147
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,049
this you don't come out

148
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:27,319
how to run something that those things
are good and it's great to hear from

149
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:36,049
experts live mix black you know things
that happened throughout the United

150
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:44,559
States but we better start teaching as a
formalized as a nation because we're

151
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,119
gonna lose America's infrastructure and
some gonna happen where we have a power

152
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,869
trip or we have a water system that
becomes contaminated or have something

153
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:17,519
in manufacturing and you know if you've
got to be resource center here over the

154
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,879
summer

155
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:35,158
already gone this system shows in
America we look at a place of

156
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,229
complacency

157
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:43,759
you know we can complain about people
violating our rights but we can go to

158
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,429
Facebook and we can wipe out there click
on every four hours known to mankind

159
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:59,469
right right you know we've reached the
point that we care about security we

160
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:09,499
hear about not really do anything as far
as education to really try and consumers

161
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:17,909
you know everybody in this crowd
probably you know you need each time you

162
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:24,769
connect to any type of wire that's open
warrants and as I walk around people are

163
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:32,389
just walking into the hotel while I'm
over at Starbucks and you know I see

164
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:40,208
people just walking around why are you
following we but anyway so we we should

165
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:45,709
all these different things we show
students how do you say ok very

166
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:53,509
different types of scanners but we don't
do it just windows because we even

167
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,860
though Windows runs

168
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:06,979
share or Linux Enterprise Center in your
marketplace job insecurity or networking

169
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:18,520
so you know what we need to expose our
students to do that with our new

170
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,870
employees their department they did I'm
staying group policies morning software

171
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,899
switches spectrum analyzers for wireless
they need to understand those very basic

172
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,720
tools such as far shorter times dozen
times and they say I can get your

173
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:52,080
password easy it is easier on them and
send them where you want them to go and

174
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,129
that our school but if you look at it

175
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:06,400
colors that you see around it and say
students can be produced from work what

176
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,419
we need to do that every school and we
need to start early where you know the

177
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:20,100
law enforcement or walk students going
to be using something like this tumblr

178
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,030
using GPS mapping out wireless so that
they can see where the isotropic

179
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,590
radiator is so that they can have

180
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:39,020
understanding security want wpa2 AES is
not good enough to make sure that you

181
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,250
got a RADIUS server their IDs and IPS
systems that are employees but we're not

182
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,700
doing that go through my college career
and you go through it he says

183
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:59,559
job so you commit an entire you know two
semesters or three credit hours of the

184
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,178
morning just job that's good and you got
a job at ASB I mean you can just go

185
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:10,460
through those like a million miles now
but you know Java we've been a teacher I

186
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:19,470
was gonna teach dynamic SQL databases of
colleges this how to make a database

187
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,580
this would take place

188
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,760
you know these are bills these are the
individual side of the field in this

189
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,260
marks on pace to you on this is my
through what do we go through this I

190
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,940
hate this isn't the SQL injection this
is what you take place in this is how

191
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,880
they is one you know are we going to our
people who write applications and it

192
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,500
would you know we usually take this much
on an application security in this much

193
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:53,330
so you know one of the things that we
did this is as good this season so we

194
00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:04,780
haven't tried to go exactly did you get
it going

195
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:20,780
so of course you example is this simplex
this we make it here but you know we

196
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:27,600
just teach own because the kids growing
up into space and then you say hey this

197
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,070
is so perfect that works and we can scan
is not addressed many scary movies MAC

198
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,860
address and MAC addresses when you say
what was wrong what is almost over and

199
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,530
you'll see its K device this touchscreen
is using manufacturing seasoned

200
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,180
healthcare the whole nine yards so once
they see that they begin to learn it go

201
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,640
over two minutes in the car

202
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:01,930
breakaway you know I want

203
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,750
operation of people were each charged
listen to me not just in education

204
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:16,440
directors but also these lapses in your
organization with your small business or

205
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:27,720
whether a medium-sized businesses that
so when we look at the upstairs we go

206
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:38,310
over and we find out basically support
for Windows so when you see the kids are

207
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,310
remote desktop uniquely try to login
because they win over their resources

208
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:48,870
passwords are and then find out it fails
to teach them you know but you also

209
00:24:48,870 --> 00:25:02,949
there to see things like when I see you
have a sparkly system so the newseum try

210
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,420
to tell me and when they try to tell me
into it will take place isn't going to

211
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:18,570
fail and they will be looking starting
to change your number you can tell me

212
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:26,710
the IP use wrist and of course this this
shows that way I swear they find out

213
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:35,730
that it is and research and just like
yours and you can find out where you can

214
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,140
tell how people who put things in
infrastructure they skip something every

215
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:46,270
manufacturing or even in a hostile
environment if they're not the correct

216
00:25:46,270 --> 00:26:00,080
equipment that's gonna be damaged so I
mean you can't see that but of course

217
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,500
they they learn

218
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:10,640
and they're going to skate into my eyes
and there you see the director and then

219
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:31,720
immediately just kill all the services
listed this motor which one is best

220
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:44,310
lighting system can be shut off every
homes is not just the imaginative she'll

221
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:51,020
text but you know everybody usually sees
this and I say we just tryna windows

222
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:58,970
because you guys are a small college no
we don't know details do more versus the

223
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:05,610
Linux but we also do Mex because in the
enterprise you all there and this is an

224
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,979
example when are we going using Linux to
do the exact same thing and we had to

225
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:20,090
wait for the hashes in there so they can
get all the passwords and we tell them

226
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,669
you know rwanda has gas so that we can
find your permission and is it goes

227
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:33,730
through that you find all the different
all the different users are advised and

228
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,860
then of course we allowed them to go
through the entire upload malware

229
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,449
you know we tell them i can text file
which they do it

230
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:52,260
senior students we make sure that they
can do we teach the bad side that if

231
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,400
they know the bad side of the good side
of it we take them over to the good side

232
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:05,860
so they can start locking things down
and you know I was just basic examples

233
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,590
because it does cover infrastructure
manufacturing healthcare business and it

234
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,750
also covers themselves to protect our
own identity

235
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:30,429
you know the thing about learning today
is with social media we're adding these

236
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:40,169
extra things in my life has found their
plans to you know now I've got like five

237
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:45,040
thousand friends over which two of them
will help me move I really needed a

238
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:53,200
friend right and so when we're teaching
students they gained 20 45 minutes to 1

239
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:04,270
hour lecture just behind there and then
they have a twenty-minute take home and

240
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:09,799
cuddle software back in my day we did
the whole hello world and we were so

241
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:16,750
happy to see if my whole world and it
was a programming language so primitive

242
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,549
today it's just unreal

243
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,100
back up in

244
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,289
I'm in with much of what we were doing
we are people that were very patient

245
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:40,309
there were so many of you guys actually
had to run against ok now you working

246
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:52,039
out what I'm going to do is keep the
blockage there I used to working in his

247
00:29:52,039 --> 00:30:03,600
new skills used two men to wear them to
show them into be patient I how many

248
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,299
guys have been to a seminar in when you
get to the sooner you think I don't

249
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:18,549
waste money doing this I had more fun at
the last night right you can actually be

250
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:28,039
patient he trained people skills and
trying the UN Security as you do that

251
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:35,280
don't be intimidated today's world
recession in the way the job market is

252
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:42,830
what have you like I was saying earlier
micro dirty jobs education there's 3.2

253
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,139
million jobs are available today

254
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:55,700
we don't have the skills that can do it
so whenever trade in these folks going

255
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,260
to seminars make sure similar to provide
you with a chance to make sure that when

256
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,330
you do trading make sure you have that
soft fluffy stuff that you have to do

257
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,260
every year from sexual rest made to
avoiding phishing emails being safe on

258
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,990
the internet that kind of thing for the
office people but when you do trading

259
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:22,640
for your organization don't be scared
because most people are afraid to try

260
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,590
and people because they fear for their
jobs that's my one of you to join them

261
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:36,040
too much does this dog gone but what we
need to do is we do that because she saw

262
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:44,139
the people are standing up here now that
it to people because of complacency lack

263
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,970
of security

264
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,400
you know we had a retailer who actually
left your HVAC units or SCADA system

265
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,240
with Nepal passwords we've had a
retailer system that through wireless on

266
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,370
Friday afternoon that left it open

267
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:08,899
security network cases every case after
case education isn't just about how

268
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,760
colleges should begin to trying
education is also in the workplace and

269
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,310
of course with colleges or universities
if they don't train or excuse me they

270
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:27,000
don't change their methods of training
reorganize his skills gap in companies

271
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,820
are there are and you know I have my
students all the time ago what

272
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,460
programming languages do you know
they're going to start for trainer coble

273
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:48,450
and there's a really weird and I still
want to go out and get some small way

274
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:56,250
Ruby on Rails PhD and and then they'll
say hey teach me whatever and I'll take

275
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:03,740
the time to do that and if you want can
I see you guys if you're not a night see

276
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,750
you guys may come from businesses or you
may be associated with security and you

277
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,020
want to know a little bit about what's
happening it making you go around and

278
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,960
you see these kids next door to see
drones and lock picking him and all his

279
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,830
stuff

280
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:31,480
social media we need to teach people how
to analytically without remembering I

281
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,570
mean I don't know to do so happy

282
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:46,470
but training starts with ends in with
security you got what we are reasonably

283
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,880
decided that we would do is we reach
viruses into the network not our school

284
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
networks

285
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:59,340
loaded into control network and you
would think why are you introducing

286
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:09,750
viruses into the network now imagine
going to a four year university going to

287
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:25,020
get over a network and taking back what
do you think there was no school to make

288
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:35,639
a purchase requisition and going to
start over

289
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:45,770
you know that it works in your life when
you don't need it to other banks and

290
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:55,400
technology and it's going faster and
faster we had to turn out students like

291
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:06,140
I said that's one week and here's what
we tell our recruiters whenever they

292
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:12,350
call when they put those skills among
the resonators they've done their hands

293
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:20,850
and they are doing in control not just a
minute really really big when I simply

294
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,130
big you're talking about really big
school before school lab R you got over

295
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:33,040
200 computers with remains what we
introduce so they can go in and destroy

296
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,420
stuff so they can fix though so that you
know how to protect your right and when

297
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,970
these workers call we have to show or
tell me that they do not have a debate

298
00:35:45,970 --> 00:36:02,839
and what i read your specialty is there
actually actually asked asked bones

299
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,130
you work with her ask yourself do I know
how to protect

300
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:13,690
got social networking the Brocade
switches range do you know how to

301
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,170
protect not just give up their whatever
do you know how do you know how to

302
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:25,850
predict that it's better to change the
way that we're thinking about education

303
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,180
and that's in the workplace and we
talked about security in the workplace

304
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,930
we better be changing the higher
education anyway guys that's all I've

305
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,790
got my job sounds like I'm feeling when
you go out

306
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:49,450
workplace help those in need and don't
expect the new guy have twenty to thirty

307
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:49,790
years experience
