1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:10,320
user you should go in but Baucus to make
you anything really fast and this is not

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,940
about making fast things it's about
making things investment but if you like

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,090
talking about fast things than cars and
bishops so we should hang out at some

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:28,390
point this weekend so the song is
essentially a rambling about stuff that

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:35,670
myself and my friends have made in
various makers basis most notably

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,809
emergency Georgia Tech but I got a bunch
of friends there might even their

7
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:47,349
resources they're like miners and their
started I was interested in robotics and

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,030
high school when I got to college at
Texas as pure science major I started

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,399
hanging out

10
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,079
machine shop and realize that I like
making things with my hands a lot too so

11
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,460
they kind of got me involved in and
ballots past two years but I also do

12
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,929
some research and and most of my
researches and physically part of it

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:18,439
things so I'm gonna talk about how to
make really anything you want in an

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,050
efficient manner using tools are now
really accessible

15
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,740
and before I really get into it I have a
QR codes if you want to follow along you

16
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,169
can just download sites I got a bunch of
links and stuff

17
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,990
the format of the target is going to be
about some techniques of constructing

18
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,570
things that may be constructing things
that are three-dimensional are very

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,770
complicated a lot easier and how it's
you essentially resolved very difficult

20
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,490
to make things into very easy to make
things so like taking a complicated

21
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,170
three-dimensional art and then taking
that down to the point where you can use

22
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:07,290
the bands on three axis CNC Miller
things like that I meant to bring in one

23
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:14,410
of my free to bring home its so talk
about that a little bit we'll talk about

24
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:21,190
some softwares and resources for you
want to design something and and Chad or

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,020
want to design a circuit board or you
wanna get a circuit board made by

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,960
courthouse where do you go to do that
where to buy electronics parts where to

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,830
buy motor controllers a robot parts and
then talk a little bit about machines

28
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,320
like 3d printers and CNC routers and
soldering irons and get started and

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,299
making things where to go and what to
buy three get started and what are the

30
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:57,520
things that I really like to use things
but I don't really like to use my name's

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,730
child I'm CSI undergraduate course I'm
doing a victory lap right now it's year

32
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,030
round

33
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,890
text for a little while but it's been a
good time so far as a bunch of

34
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,290
internships because I like having some
experience and that's one of the reasons

35
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,929
why I like making things we learned
something last text books like actually

36
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,630
doing so making things is really the way
I complicated and I want to do something

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,319
with it

38
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:42,078
I like writing a lot it's really fun I
think he's an audit also music and

39
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,719
building things some of my research
interests so many I machine learning I'm

40
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:55,129
into nuclear engineering and breakfast
so before we get into you know how I

41
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,370
think you should make things I just
wanted to give you a little bit of

42
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,950
information before so you can get a
little perspective and how I think about

43
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,290
making things sort of first really big
project happen of high school and I was

44
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,780
really bored with what I was learning in
physics and chemistry and I had this

45
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,668
kind of quarter life crisis and I
decided I wanted to do something that no

46
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,380
one had really done before I wanted to
do a real science experiment something

47
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,900
that I never been published before and
at the time I was kind of into renewable

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,650
energy I still am now i think is really
really awesome and I found out popular

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,099
Science magazine that people were
building nuclear fusion reactors in

50
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:43,050
their garages and basements and I said
you know maybe I should try to do that

51
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,460
because as you know that you could build
a nuclear reactor in your basement that

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,239
sounds like a totally legitimate thing
that any person so I wouldn't worry

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,620
about anything these days is represented
by community on the internet and

54
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,620
building nuclear reactors in your garage
is no exception

55
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,400
there's this awesome website called user
dotnet

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,799
that's a bunch of physics and
engineering people who likes to build a

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,600
high-energy physics experiments and
their garages and so this whole system

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,970
ended up being a vacuum chamber vacuum
chamber with a system of a compromise

59
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,930
that sucks nearly all of the air out of
the chamber gets down to very near the

60
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,160
pressure outer space and then you
probably in some deuterium gas prices I

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,120
still provider trends just got a new
trial in the nucleus and then you have

62
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,070
like a glorified spark plug on the top
of the vacuum chamber that allows you to

63
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,000
put in voltage into the chamber and you
simply put 50,000 volts of electricity

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,220
into the chamber on a little bit and
Accenture negative potential and when

65
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,860
you do that you start by analyzing
nearly everything in the chamber you

66
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,010
attract everything that's positive one
stylized to the sensor and so you get

67
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,760
this little positive star easy for me in
the center of the chamber and everything

68
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,210
sort of get attracted into that and you
get enough energy on the things that are

69
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,900
trying to do that

70
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,150
putting off all the gym so you can
really create nuclear reactions in your

71
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,479
garage and it's a very very low amount
of radiation really laughable you have

72
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,500
to run these things for tens of
thousands of years and be standing

73
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,080
within you know actually start absorbing
enough energy in your tissues to make

74
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,139
things like cancers mean of course
there's a risk of cancer at any exposure

75
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,289
to radiation I mean we're all
radioactive banana for breakfast this

76
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,330
morning was certainly radioactive
everything's are you active this is a

77
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:58,139
very very low amount of radiation this
is like banana level radiation reaction

78
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,770
rate so I'm fifty percent of reactions
that happened in this you get killing

79
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,109
three and the other percent you get
tritium release and you're trying on the

80
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,289
other side you really support and you
can detect the neutrons and right now I

81
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,710
tore the whole thing apart and I'm
building a particle accelerator so

82
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,010
that's like my next project after you've
done it you kind of look back at the

83
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:31,700
vacuum chamber and exercise and how
resourceful you are and it is almost

84
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,490
certainly a very hard

85
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,930
engineering challenge as well but
billion particle accelerator makes it

86
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,889
look like us together so I'm trying to
build a cyclotron which involves making

87
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:48,260
an MRI strength magnetic field and
putting a vacuum chamber in between them

88
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,060
frequency switching essentials and if
your interested let me know but that's

89
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,130
not the stocks are moving on

90
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:04,360
I've done mechanical things too but
you're on the left is called atomic

91
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,470
puppy

92
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:13,250
unfortunately built this in about a week
I was interning at the time and the

93
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,600
place I wasn't any had this really nice
hackers based on campus that they would

94
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,550
let you use so I 18 hour days that work
for a week and worked for a lot of time

95
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,630
that I was supposed to work and then
spent 10 hours building robots and they

96
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:36,030
had this little CNC machine I was able
to make all of us are printed out of PBS

97
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:43,750
and then the main body frame is made out
of aluminum rods from MasterCard black

98
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,990
pieces I didn't see the Super impact
resistant material that's actually

99
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,920
really easy to work with such a great
candidate for the three pounds and it

100
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,290
was pretty funny thing on the rate is
electric go kart that I made their kind

101
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,140
of MIT bildt's

102
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:15,689
cards time and the column GE cards and
this is a southern pride because it's so

103
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,830
bright and this is some child

104
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:27,830
Atlanta Maker Faire that was writing it
was pretty fun so it's kind of a

105
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:37,610
brushless motors what is much smaller
scale and looking into all sorts of

106
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,060
really fun technologies that will be
used in large-scale electric vehicles on

107
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,800
a smaller scale and once you sort of get
familiar with this electric vehicle

108
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,270
workflow you kind of like an addiction
you want to put like a motor on

109
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:58,870
everything because you can go by 1.5
horsepower about a hundred bucks and

110
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,290
then you buy a controller for 50 bucks
and then some batteries for 60 bucks and

111
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,730
you know for about $300 altogether you
have like a really silly electric

112
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,650
scooter or something like that

113
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:20,550
the tour of these things have electric
longboard and originally was ruled ride

114
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,250
but the way the more store it would
target the board up so you could throw

115
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,710
yourself off the board with how much for
the murders had to turn around and

116
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,450
front-wheel drive down and said you
always go breaks into your electric

117
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,899
vehicle

118
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:51,670
things of that sort of develop the room
maybe like the last twenty or thirty

119
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,029
years as electronics mechanical motion
have become more ubiquitous and really

120
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:04,429
cheaper which have unveiled a new way of
using computers to make the entire for

121
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:10,470
typing process quicker since we have
smart machines now allows you to really

122
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,499
hard task to become super easy like 3d
printing something you can spend most of

123
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:19,470
your time focusing on designing the
actual park and then using the computer

124
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,730
smart tools do the rest this was a
totally new school coming from high

125
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,089
school where we would take plywood we
did this competition called best we

126
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,800
would get like a big box full of parts
and then we had to make a robot over six

127
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,618
weeks with it and we can't just shot
from the hip and we will take you

128
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:46,240
through a band saw no cut pieces off
until we had something that looked like

129
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,829
a robot I got to draw a lot people to
wear on their computer for like two

130
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:57,410
weeks designing a model in a cat
software which allows you to do

131
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,740
three-dimensional parametric drawing so
you can build your entire thing in the

132
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,899
computer in a mock up the bolts and
screws and see how everything is going

133
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,429
to fit together like your mothers your
stress analysis on how all the parts are

134
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:16,519
going to move around they would spend
nearly 80% of the time doing this on the

135
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,230
computer press a button have their
materials list generated for them to

136
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,490
master car and electronics Supply
Warehouse get all the packages back and

137
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,339
then build the robot and it gave because
all of the parts though the design was

138
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,730
done they would send it to a water jet
or laser cutter

139
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,130
and then you have a bunch of parts that
slot together and you have a robot and a

140
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:45,519
date of actual machine so this is a
valid way to make real things because

141
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,079
you can make things like what you're
just gonna have you know message to the

142
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,939
limits of what materials and electronics
can be used for you know stand the test

143
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,860
of going to competition a competition
even though they're built in like a day

144
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,699
or two so I was kind of obsessed with
how this can can have in how regular

145
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:15,899
people like you or I can use this to our
advantage than anything so I kind of

146
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,579
took the Wikipedia definition and and
change a little bit my lighting

147
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:29,310
technologies that we end up using either
like us to control things like CNC mills

148
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,399
lathes and routers CNC mill is like a
really fancy dress that can move in a

149
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,350
couple of different access ladies are
things that make parts that are

150
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,459
considering about so essentially like
cylinders and bolts and screws and stuff

151
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:51,109
like that may be used for
two-dimensional flat parts you can cut

152
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,399
out with a router is basically cutting
tool water jets opportunity as someone

153
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,410
like lets you know like this place has a
water you could work here this place has

154
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,500
a water you could use or you can go to
this university and have a large jet

155
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,339
that they let their students use

156
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:14,899
does which is awesome things you can use
their water coolers to lever and it will

157
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,110
spoil you my my parents speculate
sometimes

158
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:26,120
the reason why I have taken five years
to graduate from just because they have

159
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:38,339
twenty-four seven access and it's
essentially this machine that takes up

160
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:52,250
to six inches thick steel and then it
uses water cut out your parts take one

161
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:03,420
class so the deal I really really need
and we have this program after you've

162
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,029
demonstrated your ability to use all the
machines in space you can volunteer and

163
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,550
you give three hours of your time a week
to come in and help other students make

164
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:21,810
their parts and you get 20% about 90%
amazing crowd of interdisciplinary

165
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,979
people got a hackerspace wherever you
live it's getting involved in have that

166
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:39,690
in my Resources section atlanta has
freezing totally epic people involved in

167
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:47,320
you know sort of uncommon to come across
as being able to access them all the

168
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,410
time but there are tolls now like big
blue saw and you can see your files and

169
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,770
what meddling in like a week they'll
send you back water jet parts it's a

170
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,000
pretty cheap rate of actually getting
cut out and they handling all of the

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:15,560
rain the machine almost 30 starting
point where the laser cutters and 3d

172
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,709
printers are very very minimally priced
more than that actually constitute them

173
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:37,920
and you can make those yourself so often
times you know so low level makers

174
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:54,959
3d printers or or taking so the first
technique is called earlier with you

175
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:02,030
this is basically a way of taking my
wanting to make a box we take this box

176
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,770
divided into sheets and then generate a
pattern of slots that fit together like

177
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,180
your fingers together with each other

178
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,280
this is really need you can add
fasteners in a really region structure

179
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,079
this

180
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,760
the picture is kind of terrible
resolution but it's a small compared to

181
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,789
how you can see that makes any sense
whatsoever

182
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:35,760
there are there are buses on this frame
that's into this aluminum extrusions and

183
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:45,330
I'm using that take advantage of the
steel fasteners and into a really dirty

184
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:58,199
part out of wood are pretty common frame

185
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,620
technique and there are a lot of online
now that will generate this website

186
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,299
called me her case dot com and you can
eat size of the box you want and what

187
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:20,139
hardware you want to use SVG or a DXF
file for you which you can go and then

188
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:24,620
like Trey Songz wooden hand or send it
to your laser cutter and then cut your

189
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:37,340
box it all together and then you gotta
finish the project includes box 220

190
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,040
which again this usually cheap these
days one of my favorite techniques i

191
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,120
think is kind of underutilized right now
is actually I've mentioned this several

192
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,250
times like it is taking a break into
slices Lexus just recently published a

193
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,480
video where they hired this art studio
to make one of their cars out of

194
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,170
cardboard and they took a
three-dimensional design of the entire

195
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,800
car and then use the software called one
to make and it goes through you tell it

196
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,210
the size of materials that you want to
use and how you wanted to see what you

197
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:26,550
can do like these puzzles pieces and
then they're slotted together like

198
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:33,550
finger joints essentially but it can
also just lots that are slices just sit

199
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:39,450
next to each other so you can go
together or use a towel tired part so

200
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:55,420
with the Lexus car

201
00:19:55,420 --> 00:22:35,040
so

202
00:22:35,040 --> 00:24:07,539
technology competition

203
00:24:07,539 --> 00:25:21,830
cardboard answer

204
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:41,918
stands for fused deposition modeling
which means that I didn't have time to

205
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:54,950
set up your printer running before let
me know and I like the way this whole

206
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:07,519
process works FDM printers and when it
goes through the belts and then you just

207
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:15,029
move around in the pattern that you want
so what you take any 3d model you want

208
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:23,269
to your layer thickness for instance
this prince in 100 micron thick layers

209
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:27,980
think about the thickness of a sheet of
paper you have a piece of software that

210
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,419
goes through that part divided into 100
micron layers and then each of those

211
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:40,120
parts it does that finds the path around
that and then a path through that to

212
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,229
make a film structure on the inside so
most parts from FDM printers are not

213
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:51,120
actually 100% solid you put them with an
infield so like honeycomb structure on

214
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,428
the inside that lends structural
integrity what does not require a whole

215
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:01,260
lot of time or filament actually built
is not solid throughout so it seems

216
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,400
material and so you do that and then

217
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,960
the next layer process works by doing
those layers one at a time and then in

218
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,860
between those layers the platform moves
down or the head moves up and have a sad

219
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:25,760
face here in addition is because over 20
countries have a nice way of saying as

220
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,840
printers have improved a lot over the
past five years five years ago they were

221
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,129
really have to deal with and for a while
as the 3d printer persons 3d printer

222
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,930
broke I was the one who six days and
Technology IIT folks in the crowd among

223
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,010
us who you might take something that you
love you have to fix it all the time

224
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,520
because someone else broken you're not
gonna let you know when they work though

225
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,250
they can be your greatest friends it's a
really cool experience to be able to

226
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,690
like need something have an idea in your
head design it and then press a button

227
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:14,179
and then have it printed lawyers

228
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:26,990
and if you have just some money that's
as far as good as one of the best things

229
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:34,070
that anyone who wants to make things for
themselves is packaged computer aided

230
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,899
drafting and get familiar with it and
start using it to design things working

231
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:45,649
with CAD really teaches you a lot about
the process of designing something

232
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:50,840
further real world and how things should
get together and we should go and your

233
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,059
size and weight constraints and things
like battle bots and spaceships and race

234
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,980
cars all start typically right here you
know after you decide that you want to

235
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:07,639
make it look like this is your block now
especially with digital manufacturing

236
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:17,619
technologies is pretty nice it's kind of
an industry standard at the moment but

237
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:23,408
it's expensive it can't be forced
through the internet for less than its

238
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:31,570
retail price so if that's your thing go
for it they're very big company and the

239
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,418
company that owns them Dassault
systèmes find a 3d printer company but

240
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:42,909
called Stratasys who owns MakerBot and
make a really terrible printers now so

241
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:50,659
if you go get their software don't feel
bad about it

242
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:59,659
there are companies like Autodesk
software is like and if you have a edu

243
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:06,039
email address the user three which is
awesome they also have many versions of

244
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:12,359
their products that are just yeah yes
there's also Solid Edge Pro Engineer /

245
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:21,059
creo this is what nasa uses for most of
their stuff it's also and Autodesk in

246
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,158
you can find trial versions of that are
used for non-commercial version of

247
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,470
things that you want to make it last
time I checked I think that was for you

248
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:38,080
yeah yeah yeah so open scatters great
I've seen it

249
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,478
widely adopted in the 3d printing is
here and there are really great

250
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:47,259
tutorials for that and if you've ever
gotten started to like about salt works

251
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:53,659
because I'm gonna have to figure out
what I'm gonna do when they graduate

252
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:59,499
they have a really nice suite of
tutorials that it actually published on

253
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:05,809
you know you get a salt works they have
tutorials that will take you from

254
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,799
nocache knowledge at all

255
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:14,830
making a really really complicated parts
and as for electrical design goes there

256
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,909
are suffers like a like at which run in

257
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:23,820
Linux is a free open-source cats are
resigning circuits also has a huge

258
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,720
community around you can basically go
from having nothing to fill the pool

259
00:31:29,720 --> 00:32:42,400
circuit board and care

260
00:32:42,400 --> 00:34:23,440
particular

261
00:34:23,440 --> 00:35:27,930
process

262
00:35:27,930 --> 00:38:12,549
construction technologies everything

263
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:36,569
you know if I'm a daddy and the air and
did that hundred times and something I

264
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:40,689
played around with very recently is
called clarifies learning image

265
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:48,719
recognition API that allows you to use
the binary classifiers trained to say

266
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:59,349
yes this is a hell and I built this
little light saber over the course of a

267
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:04,609
weekend with a lightsaber and Arduino
and I am you on the inside of a

268
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,920
lightsaber and we wanted to try and see
if we could you clarify its classified

269
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,420
time series data so there is actually
made for recognizing things and images

270
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,699
like you give it an image and it says
this is a cat these are a bunch of

271
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:23,929
people are sad people they were not
doing any time series recognition so I

272
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:29,789
was like I want to see if they can
classify this so what we did was we talk

273
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:36,339
later faded into a complimentary filters
so we took the x value the ex

274
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:42,420
accelerometer value-added them together
took the Y accelerometer gyro value out

275
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,059
of them together and then just use a
Python script and we noticed that we did

276
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:50,860
what we did swipes we did left right up
and down

277
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:59,320
down we are building a demo using swype
no way of the lights around and fight

278
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:10,700
back and forth images so we left right
up and down we made these plus each of

279
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,609
those whites are unique in their plots
every less weight this pattern where you

280
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,230
had like the blue line going up and down
on the red line going down in the

281
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:27,840
diamond shape it was a distinctly
different pattern so what we hope is

282
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:37,220
that we construct a set of binary
classifiers and then give it

283
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,379
data in real-time and then it tell us if
this is a separate over down and it's

284
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:48,430
actually able to do this and this is
like 20 lines of Python go from sensory

285
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,000
input from an Arduino doing like very
minimal

286
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,770
three and then training that end calling
their binary classifiers so it's like as

287
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:11,300
far as writing the code as we spent like
two hours trying to get a 266 module

288
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,030
never made it work but did work and we
were doing really really good

289
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:24,090
recognition rates we have like over an
80% recognition rate for all over large

290
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:33,490
so if you ever wanna play with her own
that's indeed learning for their eyes as

291
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,540
far as materials

292
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:41,680
everywhere i buy stuff from is and this
slide if you've never been to be

293
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,480
MasterCard dot com

294
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,150
like now it's you can get anything you
want master this weird alloys titanium

295
00:41:52,150 --> 00:42:05,800
or stainless steel sheet extrusion form
fasteners deletions drill bits machines

296
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,530
motors everything it's a really really
awesome place in the ship super fast

297
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,930
sometimes they're more expensive than
other places but if you need a sheet of

298
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:22,470
6061 aluminum quarter of an inch thick
by foot by foot and you need tomorrow

299
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:38,640
master is where you go places for buying
like raw electronic 632 you know if you

300
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,690
want that on a date for that you can
like sticky USB stick into your USB cord

301
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,300
into in the program

302
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,510
holiness of you are aware he's already
but sell

303
00:42:53,510 --> 00:43:02,890
nice development kits for both of those
actually have a good tutorial databases

304
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:10,629
sites they're really really great
resources we have a couple of scrap

305
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,150
yards

306
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:17,440
sometimes they're really fun things and
I would encourage you to find find one

307
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:26,360
around here you can get really great
things and good inspiration is amazing

308
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:35,540
what you can buy on Craigslist that the
last you are like my favorite to Chinese

309
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:41,380
websites they are they sell really cheap
like a three-phase brushless motors and

310
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:50,810
batteries and hobbyking actually sell
overseas but you like bikes is hilarious

311
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:57,279
website that sells like electric bike
components from China and their website

312
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,670
is pretty there is the translated

313
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:08,220
really funny but my friends and I have
order stuff from the site to its pretty

314
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:18,339
reliable I would say they are but I get
a couple of slides here

315
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:27,920
machinery and tools that I recommend any
specific questions asked me be happy to

316
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,290
give you my recommendations

317
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:34,819
these are things that I work with like
everyday stuff so I like to think that I

318
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:39,470
had over a period of time

319
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:47,160
experiences and information to make
suggestions about what you should just

320
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,578
interested in getting started in 3d
printing up me is like a fantastic 3d

321
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:59,740
printer $600 right now like crazy number
347 they must never break the same could

322
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:06,479
be said for this guy which is made by
the corporation was actually be thrown

323
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:16,040
away but he's still a pain sometimes you
can also other tools CNC routers there

324
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,220
are now almost entirely free printable
CNC routers and then you can use that to

325
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:26,649
make even more serious tools see make
three presence here out to make a wood

326
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,150
CNC router and

327
00:45:30,150 --> 00:48:24,390
nice machine so there is a box

328
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:42,000
resins are really really nasty chemicals
sometimes and oftentimes those who agree

329
00:48:42,000 --> 00:49:06,670
but looking for anything else going to
several places that have like the RXT X

330
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:13,519
in Houston Texas are used I don't know
if it was that cheap but all of the

331
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:20,379
drivers and software as far as the laser
itself goes I mean glass laser

332
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:30,329
technology if you exercise and it looks
like it has promoters and things like

333
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:42,599
that you can write your own drivers that
hasn't he later to buy it's probably the

334
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:43,970
free site guys have

335
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:56,750
$16

336
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:12,849
y GroES readers

337
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:34,090
they do you make the freemen of eighty
2020 it's really really really tired

338
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:45,310
myself who was 24 hours that's that's
that's magic once I get the cyclotron

339
00:50:45,310 --> 00:51:00,320
bill so everyone for coming out of time
for you have it set out somewhere over

340
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,480
here and things or race cars and
spaceships
