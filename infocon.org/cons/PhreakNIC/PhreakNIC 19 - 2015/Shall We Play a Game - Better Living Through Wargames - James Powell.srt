1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:13,480
welcome as I actually enjoy this is my
my personal 600 guests enjoy this

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,660
it started as a random and thanks to a
friend jimmy has now become a

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,730
presentation so provided I don't throw
up in the next five minutes should be

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,410
alright so good afternoon

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,699
my name's James I've been on the
computer industry for awhile now I don't

6
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,910
think about it that way because when I
look out and see everybody there all my

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,529
age so I just simply although the same
amount of time and now work I found out

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,780
of one of the old guys and that's
starting I said I wasn't coming here I

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,910
might as well tell you a little about
myself how actually David sending money

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,500
goes it all started back in nineteen
eighty-four roughly you know I do not

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,539
remember starting to go home and I'll
see we actually so it was a glorious

12
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:09,619
machine and I play video games are
pretty much until it broke which was

13
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,590
surprising my senior Bible last a long
time

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:24,690
actually got into the industry network
administrators also shot later cuz

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,679
that's not an easy job

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,640
after that I began my crappy managed by
joining the dark side and starting right

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:47,090
guard with her also rejects we get
together after this and then this from

18
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,360
last year about the company I work for i
seven 2014 what I learned everything

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,760
that I had done up to that point was
kind of a warm up for what I really

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,180
should've been doing the entire time
which is an extension of rebuilding cool

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,649
stuff but focusing more on the security
side of things which is how I got here

22
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,780
so this talk really is about all of
David Lightman hygiene and adventures in

23
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,390
the movie war games and how that applies
to your life actually refer about

24
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,070
something a little bit different so
gonna cover today so that outsiders

25
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,019
replied to the one I actually wrote this
I was an outsider I really had not a

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,320
hundred security I was kinda look in and
see where else does not cover the basics

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:47,780
are and then a different look at how
you're trying to do school security

28
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,860
expert learning about weapons testing
and anything and then how games and

29
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:06,320
change some of them and then hopefully
better security overall gaming that we

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,420
need to ensure visibly that's what the
infection vector about it I wish it was

31
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,369
more of a vector machines ICDs to lock
them out quite work that out I am doing

32
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:24,110
a project together so they don't make
sense and then hopefully questions at

33
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,690
any time

34
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:33,900
ok so I guess my background obviously I
didn't jump into the industry as a

35
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,209
security person realizes you're on the
outside of security industry that

36
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:51,419
there's always hidden knowledge
directional so everybody out here who

37
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,470
actually does who gets paid to do
security or anything to be warning

38
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,580
systems whatever

39
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,110
got a couple of volunteers out there so
you guys you actually do this or are

40
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,190
people who dis on daily basis you may
not realize this is this kind of how

41
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,710
security officials are seen by the
uninitiated

42
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,500
black magic you know the hours like
causing banks to crash and you know

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,340
wreaking havoc on bridge everywhere in
the world and you know that's the truth

44
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,630
as with all things not quite as
glamorous although I really wish I had

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:38,700
that cool so where where my adventure
began while we're getting there running

46
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,479
ok I stumbled across this until I was
trying to win security by the actual

47
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,910
summer at it and so the post was
extracted a pastoral effects don't file

48
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,670
and I lost over the last part of that
which is over the wired overcame 13 so I

49
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:07,090
thought I can I think so and so the
rabbit hole as regular rabbit hole and

50
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,349
for those of you familiar with Jason
Campbell and here is my

51
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,130
this is the stage is calling for actual
gonna be learning new skills are

52
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:24,530
actually I just so this is part of the
bandit series of over the water which

53
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:32,150
had already told you guys don't know
about that they're also Global's felt

54
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:40,109
like I've done it and I can go out to
conquer the world you quite but you know

55
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:48,650
so that I was thought I have found a new
way to play games and I wanted more also

56
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,549
given that I wasn't the security I
figure and you know I am probably the

57
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,580
last person to discover this and you
know they're not tell anybody about it

58
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,150
so as it turned out when I actually did
talk about their body work very next day

59
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,400
no one has talked about it for a couple
of the act of the security people at

60
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:18,440
work are coming years we have a more
than help session with security but we

61
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,020
don't really do this actual security of
interesting things like that so it turns

62
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,500
out that really nobody knew about this
so the more that I kept thinking about

63
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,660
the morning patterns were urging and
things that I think about it

64
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,550
or that I was working on I realize there
might be something a little bit more so

65
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,950
given overview about what what I'm
talking about when I say capture the

66
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:55,490
flag and organs so capture the flag
played at least one of the styles there

67
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,820
there is the Japanese style pack the
beds and then kind of a higher mix of

68
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,300
those two Harry Styles you can have
anything to do with her abilities could

69
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,260
be reverse engineering general trivia
humans usually when I have him because

70
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,090
you still get more points points are
gained by completing tasks usually there

71
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,789
are even just go to any chance they get
harder they have our place sometimes you

72
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,070
unlock lower tax to get the next time he
was example of this is any one of the

73
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,380
dead on balls of you guys there

74
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,710
up the neck style is it activates which
is actually the kind of thing that's

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,169
going on right now working until you
have machines try to attack them and get

76
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,230
more abilities

77
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:56,230
comes in you actually have you tried two
different from other people from you you

78
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:04,970
get more points on the attack against
the first time she get there was it was

79
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:17,480
the first one that came up and then
obviously it had to have a reference is

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,810
that it's a it's a very persistent
dollar CTS so it really doesn't change

81
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,780
much from the more than japanese
knowledge so that your login for

82
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,820
different levels

83
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:36,809
posted online although I know over the
wire guys they can you can download

84
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:43,429
their machines so it's almost always a
single player whereas you know using the

85
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:55,400
other six teams so it's really just
using the computer

86
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,810
more difficult like any good game and
there are a lot of good service out

87
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:07,709
there for free over the wire reverse
engineering buildings match the stack up

88
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:24,390
towards the great one of those I can
tell you more about this experiment this

89
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:32,360
was new to this I think bar and install
my way to go to this year experience but

90
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,520
not knowing when to meet some new people
I said was the best way to do that I

91
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,860
know I like taking a safety culture and
I like CTS to build a portable CD I

92
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,100
machine this is a wireless access point
on a walk around in Vegas with my

93
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,450
backpack the entire time

94
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:58,990
found out afterwards the fire happened
to me and I have connects the actual

95
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,580
final challenge of it was combined me
and if you found me you know I was gonna

96
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,690
give you the way to get to know you were
gonna be a review to Frankies TV room

97
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:20,160
either a place in Vegas and I just think
people so you end up doing on Amazon and

98
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,420
spending money taken over

99
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,760
build a Raspberry Pi model to be
replaced by c4 allowed to give her a

100
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,850
three by those guys built some of the
best place I've ever seen

101
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,700
microSD card and then my favorite tool
now the Alpha AWS

102
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,399
36 and eight and then if you want a
battery pack that will last without

103
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,019
recharging for two days that guy on the
right I will host the list of all these

104
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:52,639
things so I won't do this I walk around
and because of that time and because

105
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,990
it's black out all those things they're
ready to run around the edges and no one

106
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,829
playing the game I had like a log into
the wireless and that was when they got

107
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:10,849
redirected to the site and then walked
off but I am so not not really a bad

108
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,620
about it so once again what does that
have to do with what does this have to

109
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,720
do with how this can make you better
make other people that are security well

110
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,339
I don't think I ever played and I not
played the first back when I found out

111
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,480
that I would actually have you know the
guts to try to build my all and

112
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:41,680
let people play it exposure and how to
do it but it's not an easy road in fact

113
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,579
the only question here is pretty good so
let's look at some traditional that's

114
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:58,510
how you would start beginning so my
daughter was born i read your book in my

115
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,050
hand at Kendall something I was reading
every minute so when I started out

116
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,889
trying to learn more about security and
went out and bought second books and

117
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,980
then I realized I don't have a good that
you really flashy covers and cuddles

118
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:19,910
experts good at what they do and even
more important than my asking the right

119
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:30,850
questions why won't learn so I was like
ok well maybe I wish list alright so you

120
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,300
know nothing on reddit

121
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,459
sign of a couple of things down a lot of
security

122
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,449
Comcast you know the end of the day I
was like subscribe to vote Tribune

123
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:46,399
o-rena security disclose your own
security security podcast atmosphere

124
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,930
around all of the social engineering
data coming in I still have no idea what

125
00:12:51,930 --> 00:13:00,888
to do with you know there's lots of
information on my head so well you know

126
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:08,329
I work for a company like to train
people so I'm training I started looking

127
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:15,910
at the same problem as good training
that rainfall how much it is good

128
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,939
training again

129
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:23,238
it's good to get them to spend this
money is really don't like to waste

130
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:29,739
money and then they don't seem to think
so now you'll wonder how I know what

131
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:35,919
train so i SAT back and I thought to
myself what if I could ask an expert so

132
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:42,889
does everybody who this guy is hire
illegal pornography

133
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,979
really smart do and then I realized I
read one of his books as a freshman in

134
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:54,119
college I read of life photography and
it was really intense and I got about a

135
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,720
third of the way through it and then I
put it out and say I'm not in a position

136
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:13,459
after a college senior pics up again
this time I got me so I can sit down and

137
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:21,289
talk with Bruce you know how it is time
to his brain

138
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:27,139
here and I'm still gonna be down here
and it's really not his fault it's not

139
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,689
my fault it's just not the same level so
it's very hard to make something out

140
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:43,899
thanks for the main purpose and I talked
games no connection to battle we don't

141
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,169
like playing games I mean that literally
I was putting three back in my back

142
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:59,179
pocket drive and walkaround playing that
day so how can you help us so here is

143
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:03,329
used as part of his office says when you
strip away there's no difference is that

144
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:08,368
a lot of complexities all games sure
you're defining trades goal rules

145
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:13,679
feedback system and voluntary
participation was written by or by

146
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,410
jamming on

147
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,610
football realities broken why games make
us better knowledge and change the world

148
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,440
so the point where she said how games
can make sure why games make us better

149
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:36,420
my fault was maybe a waste of my life so
I also talked to your life a lot of

150
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,839
great skills you can pick up this happy
to find this out so it's very sad when

151
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,220
she was talking about so these are
really the fourth goal rules of feedback

152
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,279
system had voluntary participation and
you may be thinking yourself ok I get

153
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,639
that sounds awesome games but how does
that help us well are amazing and the

154
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,250
reason i working for mating is because
they have goals

155
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,899
there's a clear objective sometimes you
get the structure like these utilities

156
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,209
may be helpful things like that and
there's a solution gives you a lot of

157
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,459
our waste your time

158
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:27,489
talk about the way back you know you you
can assist them and humans availability

159
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,749
but you don't know that a really big
system Linux UNIX machine I know it's a

160
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:37,019
shame I don't know what service I don't
know what versions there are mean you

161
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:46,019
have a big space to try to get with very
small like or you know here is this

162
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:55,220
doable goals achievable and that's
that's another and you can find it now I

163
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:02,319
know we don't really like rolls but it
doesn't break the rules give us a

164
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:07,329
bounding box they make that Linux box
one service for one webpage they give us

165
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,490
this playground the sandbox account of
focuses the also the rules can give us a

166
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,640
tool by the solution because when you
start eliminating the things that the

167
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,380
rules are trying to keep you away from
in this context you eliminated all these

168
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,190
past than ever and the world protect us
from shooters sometimes that helps us to

169
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,309
be honest which is actually where we
learn and follow the rules will help us

170
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:41,168
move towards our goal goal goal and the
reason why is because when you start

171
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,909
trying to go against the rules from the
direction that the creator one in which

172
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,290
is what's going to teach you the skills

173
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:55,990
feedback system engineer remember the
first time you have like the force be

174
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,390
back on if I radio and something
happened it was a very instantaneous and

175
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,430
that's been built in a game since I make
the move

176
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,700
Sanchez I make a move someone steals
apiece

177
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,800
that since the feedback feedback is
great because if you think you felt like

178
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:20,620
you have qualified oh you realize you
were all you don't have to wait around

179
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,379
you have to think there's a supporter
bility you don't have to try to life

180
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,230
through it or find out instantaneously
and this is great because the faster the

181
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,830
feedback cycle it faster you can adapt
and learn and move on and find a

182
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,990
solution

183
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,960
this is actually great for keeping us
entertained which is what makes games

184
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,960
great learning and that's usually how it
ends up when I really tough games

185
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,360
especially not regular person shooters
anymore about it no one's Beijing play

186
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:57,189
this game you did it to yourself and you
did this to yourself to do it yourself

187
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,110
you jump off the cliff and I that's what
you're gonna do it the thousand more

188
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,449
times before you figure it out and
before you realize you could get better

189
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,950
but but you will get better and usually
it's very addictive you want to get the

190
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,020
fly can't let the solution go I'm gonna
sit here for another eight hours and

191
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,110
threw it out and and you can't quit but
you probably won't and that's what makes

192
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:29,679
it all because it keeps you going so at
least in the context of games there's a

193
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,870
thing the gym economist into this may
actually be in general hogs you actually

194
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,699
have a support structure there are
people there that will help you they

195
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,770
won't give you the answer but you know
you see

196
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:50,730
time IRC is much cooler older version of
it and when you get stuck there's always

197
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,260
look at something that maybe somebody
you know that does web stuff all the

198
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:03,330
time you get off of this people so you
have this built-in support and help you

199
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:19,990
get better ok so and then explain what
games online help us to learn things so

200
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,340
that's my theory that CTS or games that
we can introduce ourselves or tubular

201
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,280
not security people and we can make
everyone better security whether its

202
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,780
application security network security we
can get people to see these things

203
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,720
faster we get into town of having their
subconscious because they have played

204
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,600
these games so we could we could yell at
them or do a lot of other things but we

205
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,590
just settled into games that actually
teach them these things a lot easier we

206
00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:01,970
actually do have to talk about something
else so how do we do this well first we

207
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,530
have to fix their perspective there that
look as an engineer my first goal is to

208
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,600
finish a feature that's what I've got a
product person yelling at me about

209
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,540
that's what they want me to do so I'm
like I just works works works and then

210
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,330
somebody comes along and says you

211
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:26,000
but that's not really the more than I
play these things the more I start

212
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:39,179
thinking about how this happened but
this year and that was changed I changed

213
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,750
my way of looking at the world has
changed a lot faster because you're

214
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,950
exposed to things that are bilities
they're usually the key things that

215
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,169
people are seeing their slightly easier
examples but their solar not that you

216
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,179
begin to catch these things whether
subconsciously the right things

217
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:07,399
differently from six months ago before I
started with this and now it's a lot

218
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:12,189
more

219
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,789
system admins and software engineers we
start realizing the need to own the

220
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,320
things that were right we need to be
more aware of our security measures as

221
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,418
you know it's it's hard work but we we
really none of us got into it was easy

222
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:31,480
we like the challenge will be like when
things get difficult like more out of

223
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,039
our comfort zones so this just helps us
can convince people that this is

224
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:45,309
something you do alright so I guess this
leads us to the last question of ok I

225
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:52,740
you are at least three maybe something
about their here you may want to find

226
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,340
out how can I actually introduce people
to the CTF realized my lovely working on

227
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:08,559
going to help you bring me one of my top
fans and the web series began sundry

228
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:16,090
for a great show infection factors is
was derived its only got everybody's

229
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,070
family playing war games

230
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:26,759
CSR invasion vectors for all the people
we were so my parents college degree to

231
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:36,399
work so I told them it was always so why
are these an infection so thanks to my

232
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,799
daughter for playing along at least 20
minutes to get that but you guys do what

233
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,289
she's doing there's no surprises just
close your eyes for second and what I

234
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,519
want to do as I want you to think back
to the very first game you play the game

235
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,350
you really remember loving you board
games card games video game just

236
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,619
remember all the things that kept you
play number all the details you know

237
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:05,850
they're probably songs that you can
still hear from the soundtrack you can

238
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,149
hear the more distant remind you that
game and his reminder that feeling of

239
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:15,158
your eyes that's what CTS will do for
everybody else the first time that

240
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,409
someone cracks

241
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:24,119
if you feel like you just go out and
it's really is not right side is that

242
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,869
exact same as the holy crap I figured
this out its realization that all of

243
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,119
those skills that you have all of our
stuff and bandit if you've ever played

244
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,918
around with Xbox there's no magic about
is just learning to use the tools and

245
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,820
that's the biggest job that you can help
them and if they don't they don't need

246
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,999
new training they just need to
understand all the entire career I just

247
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:55,850
need to extend it or look at the problem
and this makes that happen and also any

248
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,100
training or you talk to them about
something you want to learn something

249
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,570
new

250
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,769
there's a beer with themselves

251
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,790
yeah

252
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:15,210
well as the game you don't get it cares
about you can suck it games and no one

253
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,410
cares your friends make fun of you but
between you and your friends and it

254
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,930
since it is a game you get better over
time you know the first time that I play

255
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:32,590
any game and then you keep getting
better so this lowers differential the

256
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,830
usually he's most people are asking the
question of how I do this because they

257
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,419
think they should not especially for me
when I've been in the industry for 10

258
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:49,810
plus years that's what I you know I
finally it's fun you start playing his

259
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,230
first level you know like any game you
to the end and there's another well as

260
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,230
he played also because this is the game
and their own systems that have set up

261
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:13,680
this thing you're operating all people
living in the dorms and so this is the

262
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:23,340
other guys will develop my game in
general my bill to save the world I

263
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,620
can't believe that a lot of games war
games have the power to make us all more

264
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,939
security especially people who are not
security professionals are not security

265
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,030
minded and in a case since it is the
around the 20th anniversary we could all

266
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,960
have to get together

267
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:51,529
questions please feel free to ask
anything even if it's just saying you

268
00:26:51,529 --> 00:27:04,649
don't agree we can start there there are
sites that have a list that we can go

269
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:09,820
through to be sure we will catch ya so
the question is is there a list so the

270
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,399
place where I started was over the wire
and then recommended smash the stack

271
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:20,860
both of those are great sites and they
they use a system called

272
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:29,529
like things things and that actually has
a list of all the other war games and so

273
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:34,120
it's pretty easy to find all of the the
over the wire then I think this message

274
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,120
type is the very first levels of it
start with just so you can see the

275
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,459
source code and then you execute get it
to spit out the answer

276
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,340
reverse engineering the first thing you
see this year either pro or copper and

277
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,129
all you see is a simply make yourself
well I'm done so that's that's a really

278
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,429
really nice when you get into it and
yeah that's not my favorite band is a

279
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:04,580
great place for Linux Unix there's a
couple more than one all

280
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:14,090
tonight so they were over the wire has
