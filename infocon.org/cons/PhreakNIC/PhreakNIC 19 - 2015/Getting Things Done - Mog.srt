1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:12,849
those who do you think it's funny that
was all generators I stay at the moment

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:35,859
we are called to the 600 we do things
they're mixed up sometimes he finished

3
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:59,679
products without wires and I and so is
your I was asked to do speech on things

4
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,570
to talk about

5
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:26,429
nice to see that they're just show up
and down and all vehicles over the ruins

6
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:44,640
know that the terms and excellence on
this year ago today was done and credit

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,500
load often when I'm working on a project
I decide to do all these other things

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:22,290
and kind of work so much better if it
was here that will help ensure optimal

9
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't really not sure

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:04:13,840
so so so so

11
00:04:13,840 --> 00:05:55,360
does so

12
00:05:55,360 --> 00:11:20,420
so

13
00:11:20,420 --> 00:12:14,310
bugging me

14
00:12:14,310 --> 00:13:12,959
about right those are times this last
night because I do not know if we go

15
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:37,430
back to where I started as early 34 my
friend

16
00:13:37,430 --> 00:14:07,870
they won't tell us about all these
projects you haven't been so great here

17
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:35,920
we did for employers and we went through
several of the bridge so yes we have

18
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,990
assembled in China and we are sitting on
about a hundred not sold not quite

19
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:58,520
finished by 2014

20
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:18,970
honey bee

21
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:59,000
delivered projects

22
00:15:59,000 --> 00:17:05,059
so on a bunch of candles from China that
has bad service turns out of stock

23
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:27,839
time it's this huge upgrade over having
we're going to do radio I do not have an

24
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:38,490
actual or not

25
00:17:38,490 --> 00:18:05,620
know they train is going to the track
it's not super hard to tackle I was

26
00:18:05,620 --> 00:25:01,129
going to make the things that shows
whether we should learn message

27
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:49,710
data that I then the way

28
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:55,050
courses every client tries to keep the
envelope of every message to come

29
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:02,330
through the system and so there's no way
of telling me messages investors there's

30
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:09,520
no way for the break it's also easier
for them even the network all messages

31
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:22,179
just a matter i did two years ago

32
00:26:22,179 --> 00:27:03,929
years so one of the bigger they added
support for the home where are you now

33
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:13,539
every message is what they wanted
support for home assembly and the two

34
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:29,860
will be on the phone for download today
only makes the day and so the way around

35
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:51,059
as they allow senators 29 2012 just
missed a whole lot of it is people so

36
00:27:51,059 --> 00:28:28,930
everything with it and then go so I just
like any other

37
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:43,130
so the line is maintained by the
developers which is also an email

38
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:56,010
service now we'll bounce messages in the
wrong order to send people to the

39
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,470
journalists

40
00:28:59,470 --> 00:30:54,200
yes yes

41
00:30:54,200 --> 00:32:20,429
now

42
00:32:20,429 --> 00:33:05,240
so everything
