1
00:03:31,770 --> 00:04:43,160
because

2
00:04:43,160 --> 00:08:26,630
so

3
00:08:26,630 --> 00:09:00,930
and so we can close these into the level
they were just have to see so what do

4
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:13,640
that I was coming from right now but you
know he's ready to give it to throw

5
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,710
myself to say here and they said yes you
can have your computers so I did that

6
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:28,810
for some powerful companies I won't talk
about 8000 mo want this to work

7
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,959
ok

8
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:51,620
the only thing that has won the gold
price really really from Apple's stil

9
00:09:51,620 --> 00:10:08,920
from work so you have all these extra
cable connected to the TV

10
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,459
and they don't have it so that's my
laptop is a better solution you're gonna

11
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,729
be exposing the past which is not ideal

12
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:29,430
you know most of the Google Google has
been issues they want to bring it in

13
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,099
turn it into these mass communication
between us
