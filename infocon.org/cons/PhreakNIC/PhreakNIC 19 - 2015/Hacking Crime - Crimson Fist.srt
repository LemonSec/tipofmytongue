1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:39,379
this is this is part of what we're gonna
nineteen patients here

2
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:48,760
are you ok we're gonna start doing
things we are talking about a little bit

3
00:00:48,760 --> 00:01:02,160
and this is only started a little bit
yes we make stuff up your with LEDs when

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,649
it's cooler than in that space so
obviously were here we talked about this

5
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:19,180
crime that's been bad acts just like
this

6
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:36,530
tasers don't really is but it is not as
did I don't hire people and enterprise

7
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:47,399
now so the old way to fight crime to
walk around and meet he sometimes is

8
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:55,530
full of talk about David it looks like
that hard to see on the screen gives you

9
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:11,520
options to choose a prime time ranges
from like 12 7 14 21 and younger days in

10
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,040
the past to see where this happened at
your time

11
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,459
is really really awesome it works really
really well

12
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:29,500
lot of money and it also is really hard
to get when you tell them like yeah I

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,720
just kinda like to go out by crime as
they don't they don't like it

14
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:58,620
good news is just made it so I used to
do

15
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:27,269
information and so I used to do is take
several hours a day

16
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,739
clicking stuff and copy it was a lot of
time wasted

17
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:43,980
later but his data copy out where and
what time of day day we had a retired

18
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:55,750
she had to go find myself put it into a
website called best CEO best you take so

19
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:07,099
much data points where there were other

20
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:15,179
I would like that I would say you can
see different color layers here the red

21
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,340
ones Dec crimes that happen to my
database which is between

22
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,570
and

23
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:33,710
create all the blue ones are on this is
this data from about a year's worth of

24
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:46,239
practice so need these two layers I
would later other sect in there I knew

25
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,690
that during those hours of the night

26
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,490
those in the areas on that day that
there was a higher chance that I was

27
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:08,470
walking around the neighborhood

28
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:35,240
release is mostly crimes with guns so
they don't give you data on this point

29
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,830
there is a

30
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:57,409
differentiate something that ended up
being later about what they should do a

31
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,730
lot of things did show up later

32
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:08,280
didn't actually but I would just go
together all the data within the

33
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:21,280
neighborhood high petrol so usually I'm
giving us look at things individually if

34
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,090
I wanted to I wanted to say just what
the corporation's I could go through our

35
00:06:27,090 --> 00:07:14,739
season is just what I found it it was
more useful field

36
00:07:14,740 --> 00:08:30,100
last year

37
00:08:30,100 --> 00:10:10,570
and so

38
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:51,250
so you've got and I showed up and I said
what happened and you said well it's

39
00:10:51,250 --> 00:11:11,130
1708 as your butt so that the actual it
may or may not be a great things happen

40
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:33,430
but it is a much better idea to just
know and so is 52 area where

41
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:44,199
and so we can go through you can
download all the data plan only to take

42
00:11:44,200 --> 00:12:02,100
this and how it can also just as nice
batting points coordinates so we can

43
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,959
carry very easily just say it's
themselves are actually the location of

44
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:16,770
the police officers and because it
doesn't always happens and even that

45
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:30,649
should be seen until I was intense and
so sometimes you get buyers look at it

46
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,089
later

47
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:42,500
five blocks away so that I got to

48
00:12:42,500 --> 00:18:53,670
ok now what the hell do they need to do
this stuff

49
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:48,450
wow there's probably a lot and if you're
familiar with yourself and be part of

50
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,630
that is things that are reusable

51
00:19:52,630 --> 00:20:10,150
nirvana for writing so trying to buy the
waiver region they said angie Hicks so I

52
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:47,299
can show

53
00:20:47,299 --> 00:21:07,529
is okay so maybe you think something
like this where you see everything else

54
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:15,399
he does it all

55
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:24,928
normally that bad and that's not reason
may mean that it's easy for users arenas

56
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:37,440
day and these kinds of elements for
example they create is basically a

57
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:50,080
folder only days you know he's Bauer and
enjoy all of these little tax related so

58
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:57,220
I can just take these things that don't
make sense it's really easy best way to

59
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:11,320
its ok I want to show there is no one's
gonna be vigilant

60
00:22:11,320 --> 00:23:16,770
so far is Nisha was going to center on
Friday it again we could see look for

61
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:29,620
what they were going to look for a steal
cars when school gets ready or 1.05%

62
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:46,250
so we place which is slated right now
and then show us where the so you can

63
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,110
also read our

64
00:23:50,110 --> 00:24:01,530
you can see where this is trying to see
a list of all transit litany of

65
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:11,920
everything we just want to see what I'm
trying to do in our old rival

66
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:19,610
inside a bit more that way you can make
it so they will be limited but never

67
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,240
done that yet

68
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:30,080
out w whichever is a response is

69
00:24:30,080 --> 00:26:06,870
good friend in all areas

70
00:26:06,870 --> 00:27:14,540
so

71
00:27:14,540 --> 00:28:05,730
you can hear me grabbed or by a deed is
pretty standard javaScript can say

72
00:28:05,730 --> 00:32:43,820
whatever you make you're done with your
new man that's like three changes here

73
00:32:43,820 --> 00:33:26,669
most police departments in big cities
but it's very nice a smaller towns like

74
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:34,030
that can access you know so my goal with
this project and I feel like we're at a

75
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:39,149
point forward damn close to having this
available in two days they have

76
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,320
something that anyone can tell you is
you have to data all this stuff is there

77
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:54,250
and it doesn't and so that is amazing
thing about this map we put it all out

78
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,280
it's free

79
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:08,670
take it do stuff with it soars just use
it it's fine with it

80
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,929
tell us about it to us so we can we can
make cooler than happy with

81
00:34:12,929 --> 00:35:03,980
source projects with it yet rated by
certain yes so when I first started to

82
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:14,790
give it time let's say I miss school I
told her about and again I would run

83
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:28,880
into me I was these crimes but very
rarely come across something we're

84
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:43,780
starting Friday I'd say I'm going into
every month about

85
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:52,170
so it doesn't sound like a lot but it
and I've noticed that the board we treat

86
00:35:52,170 --> 00:36:01,540
the system the more accurate as far as I
know their potential applications

87
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,580
obviously you're nasty wrote that as
times of late martial arts training and

88
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:17,310
my dad day is not if you're worried they
say is this something that you could use

89
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,700
the CIA ok what do they need to worry
about this could be something that you

90
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:31,160
can use to protect your boy or you know
you see that as a certain Street

91
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:40,910
always improving 18350 unfortunately
there's fighting crime forward like a

92
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:48,410
robbery and stuff like that and you know
it is going to school and then they go

93
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,009
if they think they know they will be in
this area during these hours between

94
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,170
three and five

95
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:11,610
you know I park my car in a way to do it

96
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,920
Davis filter back to the apt

97
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:22,220
redeploying so ATP

98
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:31,040
they have credible they lucked out in
that they can afford their system so I

99
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:40,520
have talked to the commanders and she
was there and our I want to take this

100
00:37:40,520 --> 00:38:05,470
now that's nice you know right now from
this project they haven't really had a

101
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:13,439
lot of dating back to the

102
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,180
their numbers

103
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:28,980
s where people get so I don't know where
they at least get it because it is

104
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,230
generated from crime reports so recently
as soon as a as soon as that officer it

105
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:40,960
was something into the computer takes it
loads it I think it's like about a week

106
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:56,970
down time to go public website based on
all data as soon as I heard in a

107
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:31,410
conspiracy to see these questions you
have for the next version they have they

108
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:46,700
have expected
