1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:10,030
all right hand this was like a
punishment

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,739
upper division

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:22,250
I'm Bob Lewis

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:36,120
I V do agree with all this year's one of
three tracks we want them all to know

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,120
they're in the wrong track so here's a
reason to every time I see are used to

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:56,979
living living so every time I want you
to all your money is going to try my

7
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,629
heart

8
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:33,680
ok ok so how many of you girls
generation after generation

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:03:09,440
grade so

10
00:03:09,440 --> 00:04:38,610
the invasion of the united states and
the job

11
00:04:38,610 --> 00:06:03,330
these companies

12
00:06:03,330 --> 00:11:23,609
ok

13
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:36,760
nation while if you listen to in the
morning work what's in it for me so

14
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:48,279
here's what you need for you to change
ratio is what this means is the

15
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,300
marketplace for project managers is
going to do nothing as project manager

16
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,829
that makes change corporation so nothing
else away

17
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:16,739
talk to you

18
00:12:16,740 --> 00:13:22,010
use that corporations

19
00:13:22,010 --> 00:14:39,020
and I promise you I'm not going to get
any easier

20
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,829
yourselves would prefer to be
contractors like that lifestyle be very

21
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,960
happy or something

22
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,280
legislation but there are there's a
large fraction of the words that are

23
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:02,240
only employees and contractors insurance
so this is good for everybody from that

24
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:12,450
perspective politics out of it one more
thing by the way is a piece of advice

25
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,950
25% of your after-tax earnings

26
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:34,500
he bank account CD or three see you find
yourself out of the National wherewithal

27
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:42,360
to survive without source of income for
a while you get the next job you want

28
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:51,400
the job you must get tomorrow so is
actually the least secure World Asia

29
00:15:51,400 --> 00:40:33,310
these you have less to troll

30
00:40:33,310 --> 00:41:15,640
ok
