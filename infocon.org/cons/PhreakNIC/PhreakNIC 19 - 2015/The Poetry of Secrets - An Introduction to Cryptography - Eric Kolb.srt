1
00:02:36,160 --> 00:05:06,870
there

2
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:16,420
soldiers they were caught by surprise by
the fact that they just women executed

3
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:30,150
the persian faster into town so they
were able to succeed in driving off now

4
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:38,440
this is where we get the legend of three
defendants who is that Harold who dis

5
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,270
illogically ran all the way from all the
way back to Athens delivered using that

6
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:54,039
victory laps and dies there interesting
side note the fact that he was defeated

7
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,460
American

8
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,750
campaigning jeanne was actually
extremely successful he had not only

9
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,980
does it really boils gained a lot of
territory treats so he intended to

10
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:17,040
return to finish the job he actually
died of old age for around 20 she's the

11
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:26,730
first to warn authorities was right

12
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:37,430
Spartan Spartan housing form of
government debt was one of them was

13
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,080
deposed and exiled by one of his rivals
so what he did is this is prior to the

14
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,109
first

15
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:55,120
he's led to Persia Darius Darius
services so we don't know whether it was

16
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:03,580
his country or whether it was too close
to coming to get you guys but what he

17
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,240
did is he took a close look at all

18
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:24,730
each box on an ecard this message into
the water that was the banking for the

19
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:38,090
wax Milton homes will look like it was
making doing this just to go to realize

20
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:45,169
that there was something more to this
gift she has crippled the whole hey

21
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,010
here's this message says you're bound to
have a version for descend on your

22
00:07:49,010 --> 00:08:01,940
country because of this morning as part
of course they were famous least 300

23
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:13,330
Spartan tomlin's less about 4,000 other
resources they weren't alone so they

24
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,990
changed

25
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:29,710
and searched his army into the
historians personal losses can do

26
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:50,569
wonders for that though the first room
and a great amount scrambled to hear /

27
00:08:50,570 --> 00:09:15,060
host of Persians naval forces the whole
put together a massive force and this is

28
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:31,310
a great example really simple stepping
on earth is also entirely and that can

29
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:38,640
be done by vigilant enemy or even sure I
understood and so they actually sought

30
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,059
to improve upon their methods

31
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:52,529
describes how important secret messages
will be dispatched to their generals

32
00:09:52,529 --> 00:10:08,309
leather strap around very precise I am
almost all large within the scramble

33
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:12,579
sort of this one interception would be
able to figure out exactly what they say

34
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:23,149
and then target inside the message was
felt so they would have to be thoroughly

35
00:10:23,149 --> 00:13:47,580
searched so what do we do it around the
state college when this masses

36
00:13:47,580 --> 00:14:01,760
Tullius Cicero means

37
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:27,840
wire and tell me a message type don't do
anything stupid does he surrounding he's

38
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:44,690
got all the ball to right-hander what he
needs to be careful because he doesn't

39
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:52,220
know what's going on so what does he
decides to run the message in Greek

40
00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:02,640
language but it's written instruction
msg my spirit is he couldn't get close

41
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,460
enough to deliver and that's exactly
what he was doing some tires around

42
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:19,010
Spears and Justin Tuck and no one
notices about the pressure that's

43
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:38,900
amazing two days time that message said
he might have no examples of what we

44
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:52,720
call substitutions at a new translation
to

45
00:15:52,720 --> 00:19:20,580
she's

46
00:19:20,580 --> 00:20:50,899
26 example

47
00:20:50,900 --> 00:30:29,480
13

48
00:30:29,480 --> 00:41:10,410
so

49
00:41:10,410 --> 00:44:13,580
political tensions

50
00:44:13,580 --> 00:45:49,400
so

51
00:45:49,400 --> 00:46:46,840
transparent
