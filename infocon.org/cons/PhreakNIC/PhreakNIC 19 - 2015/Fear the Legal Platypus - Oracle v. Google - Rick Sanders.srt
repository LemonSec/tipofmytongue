1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:08,570
thanks for coming I'm Rick Sanders with
a little bopper my story in your

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,410
national and loving you

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:22,550
property you're in town but we made a
decision not to do not consciously do

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:31,539
any entertainment reviews of all my
server racks and so i i technology

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,890
clients 2011

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:47,060
run into and we are

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,320
marketers I was here I was invited two
years ago

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,450
2009 a great time

9
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,140
and was very questions and i got two
slides into my presentation we can start

10
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,680
talking just fine I know what he's done
by software answer questions during

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,520
answers to the questions which have
answers I don't listen and to accept

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,490
that there are likely sprained what the
issues are looking for a modern be cases

13
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,520
every day I get an email blast every day
and I'm always looking to copyright

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:43,160
questions so you know and ask questions
that's fine I didn't quite know how to

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,940
teach this when I was here last time
people are about how it works and

16
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:58,350
doesn't work with software so I do have
some introductory stuff just kinda

17
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,789
to wear software

18
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,960
intellectual property law and then more
about copyright that's the main thing

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:25,540
only thing for software and then we can
talk about the technology they meet

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:34,640
clients with it if I feel like I'm just
going every step you just start skipping

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:54,690
through about that software and IP
scheme very well

22
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,520
Congress

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,280
knew about software and some of the
problems that it would create back in

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:16,680
1978 this is very carefully and slowly
and seem to want to crash and the actual

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,010
content committee talked about software

26
00:03:24,010 --> 00:04:00,350
recommendations bhosle accepted by
congress and software

27
00:04:00,350 --> 00:05:08,789
used and and and and

28
00:05:08,790 --> 00:07:03,380
and

29
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:27,340
first businesses and basically is a sign
that people like Bill Gates software

30
00:07:27,340 --> 00:08:59,410
engineer a great businessman was going
to die

31
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:13,060
everybody can code whatever is going to
claim that becomes kind of a black box

32
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:20,888
and now I gotta tell you this is now in
case work

33
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:29,720
Alice has questioned the lot of the
patent software patents based on just

34
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,649
subject matter doesn't actually do
something that's an invention is in

35
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:39,689
retreat now but for what they're talking
to you guys

36
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:49,750
was it was really easy way to text
software but has a payment money and

37
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:56,490
about priorities and enforcing penalties
are just expensive you know if you're

38
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,779
starting a business is a great thing
because a lot of investors insist or

39
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:09,019
even a provisional patent application is
better than nothing but it's a start

40
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:16,439
it's like you know patent is a kind of
catch 22

41
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:21,969
it's a copy right in order to make
coffee you have to be awake but you were

42
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,959
not awake until you make the coffee
right you know you need money

43
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:40,550
application but nobody will give you
money until you have a pass just talked

44
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,790
about in detail trade secrets to the
extent you keep your processes

45
00:10:45,790 --> 00:11:04,349
you keep your source code then it's it's
it's a secret that has a value that you

46
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,010
take reasonable steps to secret but it's
almost impossible software is open

47
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:22,130
source and that kind of it tends to
undercut secrecy investors never ever

48
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:32,410
ever there they believe that every time
every NBA is is is is just a track they

49
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:41,480
just fall into those are the copyright
his closest my striking a little bit

50
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,280
strange because of copyright is there to
protect not functions not idea is there

51
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,250
to protect

52
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:08,270
expression no expression for easy way we
understand novels movies talk about this

53
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,540
little bar or what is what is expressed
it was protected with the word we use

54
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,130
the original

55
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,330
has to be something that has some kind
of creative choices that comes out he

56
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:29,810
doesn't come up with the separate but so
far just has to come out of your head

57
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:38,180
has to have some creative choices so
even boring things can be doctors office

58
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:51,329
in UC campuses

59
00:12:51,329 --> 00:13:02,988
protect the expression that if you were
to photocopy them but you would ya

60
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:17,299
yes yes I just signed a lot of people
you want to sign them are the ones he's

61
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:23,509
willing to just just a huge risk you
place your time your pitch into to

62
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:37,649
investors and there's like to see how
much do I show these people helped me so

63
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,070
much

64
00:13:39,070 --> 00:15:36,690
we don't have any any any black magic
and adventure bit

65
00:15:36,690 --> 00:16:47,410
right now

66
00:16:47,410 --> 00:17:19,959
is keeping it secret keep your product
and and I think about doing anything

67
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:32,640
that I can hear my heart forever

68
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,770
free album did something somethings in a
public competition would not be able to

69
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:47,810
reverse engineer with him take them
longer than the Lifebook engineer or

70
00:17:47,810 --> 00:18:11,330
more of us right I'm not sure until the
day they remind me of the flaming are

71
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:28,159
cool because they can't protect things
you can fax your fax to protect and

72
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:43,740
there's some stuff come upon a trade
secret but it still be legally protected

73
00:18:43,740 --> 00:19:52,710
you know I am actually

74
00:19:52,710 --> 00:21:00,140
structure

75
00:21:00,140 --> 00:24:43,820
ok

76
00:24:43,820 --> 00:25:22,950
of abstraction and

77
00:25:22,950 --> 00:26:34,790
obviously

78
00:26:34,790 --> 00:27:41,620
going to have burden of proof to show
that sensation similar at that point it

79
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,919
becomes the defense I'm yours forever
and there is such a thing as striking

80
00:27:48,920 --> 00:28:38,020
similarity word-for-word it's like the
way you could have come up with us

81
00:28:38,020 --> 00:29:44,850
so hard case where advertising
advertising agency hired so 3d render

82
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:58,800
but because the computer doesn't quite
render certain regions are introduced by

83
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:09,020
a straight scan in two or three weeks
even so even so hard work in the in the

84
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:16,220
equipment and a human being involved

85
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,560
help no copyright protection because
they all they had done replicated

86
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,780
something in the same idea here

87
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,160
backs in nature or not

88
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:43,530
take another couple examples
illustrations I guess is kind of protect

89
00:30:43,530 --> 00:31:28,889
the ball this is I don't know very well

90
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,190
of it matter what the whole manual
itself has become the latest one

91
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,820
individual section in its own right but
not the well yes so we can say that's

92
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:47,580
actually comes a question because what
we're looking for is very important and

93
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:58,110
highly creative need less of it to
friends or less expressive might have to

94
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,090
call me a lot more

95
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:08,250
oil but also we do some filtering we
will filter out stuff and forced to get

96
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,940
to this way the structured might be
copyright information there in there in

97
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:25,980
there this is important for the Oracle
get to know the individual public domain

98
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:33,760
but election because you're exactly
right choice arrangement is a greater

99
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:41,100
choice is copyrightable then is the
waves were new york city already we give

100
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,649
proper protection to not just ground
level expression for the vids

101
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:57,000
points of color in a painting or design
but also to larger structures and just

102
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,320
the idea of those at some point you
start cracking up

103
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:11,379
you get to a point where you go into
orbit you're no longer

104
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:18,400
I would like a copy just this page I
would wonder if I don't know who's any

105
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,720
copyright protection here because
there's probably only this is probably

106
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,500
one of the very few concise ways trying
to create a concise easy-to-understand

107
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,050
way to park featuring the park features
itself has certain criteria that are

108
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:44,620
just fun changes we just part of it so I
think this is this is subject to the

109
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:57,260
idea of the park and expression one good
way to express this part of our future

110
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:05,480
accurately fully concisely pages and in
a way that's trying to give them those

111
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:23,000
criteria merges with the idea would you
never have to call them

112
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,870
system like the fact they came up with
their own cargo

113
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,989
I think not I'll tell you why that's a
good point I'll tell you why that's not

114
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:38,049
enough to me it's just two words in
quite enough creativity isn't quite

115
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:48,840
enough imagine so creative interesting
way instead of the office of the park

116
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,950
features plays a role and explains how
the car park ranger works that would be

117
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:58,799
very creative I'm still not have
copyright to our feature worse

118
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:10,240
downpouring way of doing I didn't know
about but I don't because I think that

119
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,640
is not meant to say to you right is only
too but we don't normally

120
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:36,359
tiny things you can buy stuff in your
face yeah yeah I wonder that would

121
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:43,750
create some sort some kind of but in
terms of pure infringement yeah I don't

122
00:35:43,750 --> 00:36:06,260
think that would create a bear but I was
unfair but to me its rules of jeans a

123
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,290
lot of seems like there are other we go
I listen software tools like talking

124
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,090
about it

125
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:25,359
outside the context of software is only
one good way to code one function

126
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:46,369
around somewhere between ideas etc and
the story you don't know quite where

127
00:36:46,369 --> 00:37:09,900
learning hand raised copyright jointable
its real estate in a way they took an

128
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,630
original piece of code completely
different doesn't exist but the original

129
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,470
code that the Internet is a completely
different mutation but automatically

130
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:30,288
generated ok you know if I were to
compare to what I find similarities

131
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:39,549
Cheryl Cole through your game and
there's not a virtual ghost less

132
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:51,569
dramatically changed at all since pilots
can you reverse

133
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:59,329
exactly could make a Dr appt at that
point it becomes a translation and

134
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:04,260
that's considered an adaptation and
translation of Harry Potter is as much

135
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:13,540
or some kind of some kind of
prescription and of course also you know

136
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,370
your source code is protected and so
many compiled version of that however

137
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:26,880
bear in mind that we make copies of the
software

138
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:45,710
cases where 5259 certainly tell us that
they are used because we now here we

139
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:55,740
have a table of contents phone died and
we see that the structure to do this

140
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:06,359
this and that structure might be
protected information first part about

141
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:14,010
89 protectable at that level that local
structure just doesn't matter what if I

142
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:20,400
put in there if I follow I can use my
own words but if I follow back precise

143
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:37,370
organization might be infringing
features it's just better no creativity

144
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:53,339
actually have Supreme Court case law on
the books where the ground is weird

145
00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:07,980
creative way to organize ya gots some
categories that might be creative force

146
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,370
you have some images

147
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:16,790
the white pages or database of people's
just where they live just back to the

148
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:30,410
database we have different idea whatever
reason I that's that's a really good

149
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:38,899
point oh yes it certainly some databases
a schema

150
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,540
question can we separate the
functionality from the scheme and are

151
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,890
there more than there are ways to do it

152
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:56,060
but the schema is a structure that is
not a back questions is it purely

153
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:09,900
functional but is there more than one
way to do it and that would be a

154
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:20,000
difficult question but still sucking the
data of database just make a copy of the

155
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:47,960
whole database schema and all the code
and therefore

156
00:41:47,960 --> 00:44:39,660
everything

157
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:52,480
me know about this case involving
Sherlock Holmes and we discovered that

158
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:16,640
most humane and leader of some major
stories and the extent that the oil

159
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:41,440
would we basically put some of it is in
the public domain

160
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:56,089
2010 Steamboat Willie

161
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:03,279
merger they didn't we don't use
copyright to give

162
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:16,589
we look at software is going to solve
where there are other limits your

163
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:39,409
software over the ideas functionality

164
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:52,099
come up with a way to solve he doesn't
like the author plus 70 years right to

165
00:46:52,099 --> 00:47:03,959
that most elegantly and that you will
lose your copyright 2012 emergency money

166
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:15,259
is also something like every creator has
a kind of toy box of stuff in common to

167
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:25,589
everybody in that cost comes to play a
way to stop boastful soldier

168
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:33,578
young people these characters and
comment everybody baby to strike action

169
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:39,929
but there are two locks the same thing
with lots of basically big anybody any

170
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,150
any any technique that you're learning
today

171
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,959
coming up probably nobody has a right to
it

172
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:55,098
interoperability is actually very use
but it's important one if you have to

173
00:47:55,099 --> 00:48:01,679
borrow in order to meet you won't
program with an operating system works

174
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:16,160
were holding back to be reviews hole

175
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:24,990
very quickly now into horrible Google
abstraction you'll be surprised what it

176
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:28,410
was horrible ended up winning

177
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:41,549
let me clear and get lost in there was a
platform-independent risking that for

178
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:54,020
devices and but generally by the virtual
machine allows it to be cross-platform

179
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:02,910
there's the language itself and then the
library because your computer can eat

180
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:10,480
and he's got his own library to work and
until 2007

181
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,530
all this License this and then at some
point they license everything but the

182
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:26,500
API library under the GNU General eases
some people do you get a license I like

183
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:36,300
to open source one day going to follow

184
00:49:36,300 --> 00:50:00,000
try to make my job a big difference I
grew up there and is a little more

185
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:14,950
litigious and protect their organizing
the library

186
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:24,350
collected together two packages in the
packages into a library that has a

187
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,580
declaration

188
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,330
declaration tells the compelling

189
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:38,990
machine where to go the the path virtual
machine to the right and then the method

190
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:55,450
will and then the station is the code
that actually does

191
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:32,120
code the same that with religious thing
is that nineteen ninety-four percent of

192
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:43,759
the code is identical access no access
but nineteen ninety-four percent of the

193
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,100
covers the same tells you something you
like that in the first place

194
00:51:48,100 --> 00:52:00,670
the same thing that means to me that I
was brushing merged with one way do not

195
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:13,100
copy the problem was he still sees the
structure the code

196
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:19,290
word-for-word codes but no copying the
appeal like a breakaway with structure

197
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:24,160
because of the structure people program
in Java

198
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:41,819
nowhere and turns out I don't know how
extensive organization helps everybody's

199
00:52:41,820 --> 00:53:02,800
familiar with it binds to argue the
lower court was burned because everybody

200
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:11,370
knows that but we did it the way that I
am quite a few things does not read

201
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:20,450
because it was mostly a pack case went
to the jury and the jury found remove

202
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:28,470
your top you can't do better than jury
and almost all the money in the case

203
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:35,490
went to the tax on this point I got
Google was to set up its own

204
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:41,000
organization you probably can't at this
point back then right when they're just

205
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,980
starting a new organization might have
been killed

206
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:55,920
people could not easily program Google
now has come up their own organization

207
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:15,600
does not operate in part because I
mentioned we don't know we have very few

208
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:25,299
cases very few cases about this kind of
copy

209
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:32,780
are you mentioned it didn't copy the
simplicity of one that was used all over

210
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:44,020
to discuss the case cases is the
simplest method see his first

211
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:49,040
declaration urges

212
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:59,150
minds think the last person tells you
where to find it and how it's going to

213
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,860
be used the syntax

214
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:06,350
you just don't see how to work its
course the simple numbers you see max

215
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:20,348
but its numbers and returns the larger

216
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:32,529
we were very surprised I was my blog I
had two very excited by organizations

217
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:42,339
like but it makes sense to me and the
federal

218
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:58,808
we were looking at how they are not how
things were in 1995 1994 why it was an

219
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:07,239
issue about people needing to use job
that comes late ninety five were put

220
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:19,450
that whoever organized the job of
creating choices so what happens later

221
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:37,029
when when it comes along and back I
gotta tell you it was right you were

222
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:41,180
looking at it at the wrong time

223
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,310
organization they were talking about

224
00:56:45,310 --> 00:57:02,650
I got this from from Oracle's brief this
is what we rejoice that are not clearly

225
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:08,170
driven by functional functionality

226
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:16,410
what about the fact that gather for
themselves how can I put together a

227
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:22,230
library that is easy to use their
organizing way that people will expect

228
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,640
those are not copyrightable features

229
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:35,670
fortunately Google argued that a trial
and you can try and make sure the jury

230
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:47,870
judge a monster of an argument to me in
Google just what with the simple

231
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:56,480
argument but there is made that big and
complex is this is this was entirely

232
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,910
driven by functional concerns ease of
use intuitive miss you baby get some

233
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:08,609
experts say back ninety-five we all had
basic understanding of how libraries

234
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:13,340
organizing this is just organized way
anybody would have done it if they could

235
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,310
have made that argument then they would
have succeeded in the murder but they

236
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:27,430
did we don't know the trial

237
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:38,399
now the question now is job having
become so common that library being so

238
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:47,849
common to have a very organization so
that their products are offered with job

239
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:57,869
that has been remanded and we're still
waiting for that that the trial December

240
00:58:57,869 --> 01:03:17,730
day waiting on that in the air

241
01:03:17,730 --> 01:04:32,890
they actually fired and
