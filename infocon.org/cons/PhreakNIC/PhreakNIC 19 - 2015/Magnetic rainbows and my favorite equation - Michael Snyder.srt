1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:13,220
and also have an undergrad degree is
extremely safe universally montauk today

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,580
his name

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,560
rainbows

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,070
and making system has nothing to do with
basically up in talks over here to talk

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:33,300
about something different so into
depression

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:47,578
how would you do now of course or method

7
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:59,320
an engineer and I've had training in
both so let me just say that made any

8
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:07,530
mistakes I'm used to it it's not a big
deal would still be some contribution

9
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:21,650
even if you know first one of my coach

10
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,280
security protocol and when I want to
talk about five minutes just waiting and

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:41,760
explaining what he's doing and then I
have ordered my security protocol and

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:52,090
like I said that could be a nice I wanna
way to use next four key to and

13
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,350
hopefully the audience knows health
effects were casework

14
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:05,460
you be reduced as one and if you take
one and again so you cannot lose their

15
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,200
formation as long as you know what the
kids and the problem

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:21,649
past the server and server on with us so
many saying they see it defeats the

17
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,610
whole purpose and how I did it is

18
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:38,200
I start with a known and server and
synchronize and then server has will

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,859
call permutation so it takes a man
asking that looks a bit so that he and

20
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:54,340
it changed a few bits Department states
that he does not know so watching this

21
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,250
conversation there were things decoding
just right and suddenly it's tough so

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:10,810
the nation and how this time because it
actually created the permutation mask

23
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:18,489
and passed it to the he passed into the
server so long stories work what happens

24
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:26,500
is servers and staying licensing server
changes and he figures out that he's

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,950
been change it searches for heat that
once it finds a moment of security the

26
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,920
server head and he has a new genus never
been on the wire and at that moment you

27
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,470
use the new he passed a whole new set of
parameters to the server and that's my

28
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,490
basic concepts and will start

29
00:03:49,490 --> 00:04:15,060
reporting

30
00:04:15,060 --> 00:05:34,840
rainbows and everything

31
00:05:34,840 --> 00:06:02,599
numbers one math problem there is a
whole list mathematical problems will be

32
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:10,410
solved and instead instead of just so
let me know the factory in large numbers

33
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,660
is just the low-hanging fruit

34
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:23,360
many other choices next slide prison
encryption is like the Great Wall China

35
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,050
you know it's very tall and it's very
long and is very sweet here as Burnley's

36
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,110
you don't happen to guess the large
number

37
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:45,370
factor notice that the law is broken at
any point in

38
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,840
ambitious curitiba's penetrated any
point then it doesn't do any good

39
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,710
think the the Chinese found that out
years ago is a great idea and it does

40
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:06,310
work but it has downsides know when
things go wrong they go really wrong

41
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:15,070
with president technology the present
crucial technology

42
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:40,950
there's no one basket for all their eggs
there is a new window and we we know

43
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,390
that illusion that personally is the
solution

44
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,650
adverse and basically what that is

45
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,679
know when things are going wrong

46
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,220
you want to try every possible to lose
you and that's exactly what evolution

47
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,410
does it tried every possible solution
that's what I'm standing here right now

48
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:15,410
I'm one of them possibly through
security protocol regional there who are

49
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,790
explored exporter encoding and in
connection pool TCP which basically

50
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:29,730
means I don't want to deal with this is
packets will let the lower level and the

51
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:36,849
way envisioning this would be
transparent to all the local run your

52
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:45,990
regular VP in at one level and this will
be on on top of those two and basically

53
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:57,480
just be another layer coating next line
john wants to use correction is instead

54
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,209
of a big wall that has places

55
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,579
anywhere everybody knows where this week
that I'm using a infinite series of

56
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:14,248
speed moms where each the Christians not
that strong but its independence from

57
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,899
the next people which is independent
from the next series people in other

58
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:26,679
words if one that doesn't give you the
keys to speak to you still have to do

59
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:35,790
that work on the regular on the right
impression the breaking the castle you

60
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:44,429
get everything inside the capsule with
mine production people waiting for you

61
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:48,369
know you might get know if you can but
you're not getting the whole day the

62
00:09:48,369 --> 00:10:01,850
screen which is the next flight please
so the encryption makes them super duper

63
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:12,170
team never ever put my key security
protocol says script make a whole lot of

64
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:21,849
skis and usually turkey 101 use key so
many as 11 of illicit ok no finding the

65
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,189
stream IP packets going on and if
somebody gets is a key gets five packets

66
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:41,529
I'm not worried about nobody can get
through that they also happen

67
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:50,999
weaknesses are we have a series of small
roadblocks wolves beat box and just

68
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:59,970
because you break into one part of it
doesn't mean you get another test levels

69
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:10,230
of the video game that way next slide
please this is my busy code is not wrote

70
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:18,740
them down and see what the hell did I
won't go along the line i would tell you

71
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,800
in general which basically I'm starting
with on the server side effects of this

72
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:35,008
and I'm using it as an ex or you know
you can take a accord with the producers

73
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:43,279
value that the next 48 you'll be back
basically lose any information about

74
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,949
using an excellent he he he

75
00:11:48,949 --> 00:12:06,349
and feeling you changed and the computer
will go to the next line and this is

76
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,649
more observers will go to my side and
solutions in the next flight on a

77
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,329
client's

78
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:20,670
client launches vs permutations that
happen through the Service talking

79
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,479
and they both her instinct and then
randomly the server changes and that the

80
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,390
client has to try on the possibilities
behind this is very similar to have

81
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,439
interpretation with somebody they change
the subject and then you know you have

82
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,690
the usual all that mental processing
power to planning the soviet they're

83
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,950
talking about so this is a mighty the
server is talking to the con the servers

84
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,890
using key and the client those notices
and then the crime has to find the movie

85
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,300
that once the client funds and he does
something very special

86
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:09,010
generates home security key parameters
and in the codes for news he can

87
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,780
remember that he's never been on the
water is serving those from Newquay

88
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,040
declining revenue

89
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,469
the server changed it the client found
it uses the new she makes the whole new

90
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,880
set of security parameters including
another XRD and transmits it to serve

91
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:37,650
immediately so we have no change the key
confounded might need a new key client

92
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,340
transfers it to the server we have a lot
of good things going on here

93
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,640
the first thing being that the server
has used very little sleep now using

94
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,040
expertise and changing that Turkey is

95
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,189
minimal colin has used quite a bit and
we want that to happen now let me

96
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:06,430
explain why I'm a junior in his truck
and you're trying to figure out what the

97
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:16,680
conversations you can just listen to the
client-side and server-side and

98
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,199
herbicide takes more than one CPU minute
the client-side things once he did he

99
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:30,050
used properly has been to CPU the cold
at the wrong time but we don't want

100
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:37,569
these the driver to decode it and we
thought so the server side uses one CPU

101
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:43,189
Unit and clients losses seven seas you
then that's a whole different ballgame

102
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:52,940
because then the the eavesdropper has to
use of eight units which means if he's

103
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,269
listening to thousands of conversations
he has to pick and choose which

104
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:06,240
conversation wants to listen to your
iPhone and your other devices even if

105
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,850
their slowest CPUs bees still have
surplus CPU power so pretty crucial load

106
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:23,620
on the client's son and not on the
server side we help results in many ways

107
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,570
now just using my security protocol as
is written was four pages I think would

108
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,180
be a big change for the better but
there's a lot of things we can do that

109
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,239
we're not necessarily do so this flight
is going to extras and then we'll look

110
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,310
at the other things to do so

111
00:15:52,310 --> 00:16:00,770
one of the extras with new standardized
standardization and what that means is

112
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,710
basically we don't want to do everything
the same same way as other people do you

113
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:16,700
know that they're using a 56 we want to
use a 64 bit or no message digest in the

114
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:25,730
file you want to use as we want to do
things differently for more security and

115
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,350
one way of doing especially in my
protocol I need to pick a new mexican

116
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,209
people usually come in with a bunch of
different functions that produces

117
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:45,839
integers next slide please take the
integer

118
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,160
function of the times damn we we just
knew we would get the timestamp in

119
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,089
seconds and that's a big long numbers
and we use that as an extreme heat of

120
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:02,200
course using the timestamp as a
excellent he has the eavesdropper

121
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,220
me try and figure out what we're doing

122
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,690
take a random number between 0 and 100
but by 2008 2010 and the steak the

123
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:23,790
energy value but you know so thats a
unknown number +1 random them which

124
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:29,129
would be pretty hard to figure out what
their color choices for example let's

125
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:37,850
take the the sign of the times and it
took around the green General about and

126
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,260
I think the energy that you do decide to
the timestamp is very interesting

127
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,280
because it's over and over again and
coarse-grained members read them so

128
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,389
that's a pretty good way to reducing
enrollment key for example let's take

129
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,490
the time spent in seconds

130
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:05,460
think the screwed up which will be
invited to it and then take the integer

131
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,540
sequences can we do that yes could you
please drop her figure out you know how

132
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:19,040
you're generating extra key many good
but this is a big deal because you know

133
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,690
there may be home take the times did
raise it to the random number between 0

134
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,860
and one that will also produce

135
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:35,629
now I'm not suggesting that we use any
one of these ideas will suggesting is

136
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:42,809
having a big long library list of all
ways possible functions including user

137
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:57,889
libraries including and talk about
playing there

138
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:08,850
so basically I can imagine 23 different
functions that can generate sequence

139
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,060
sequence of integers and for an XOR keel
you know you don't want they

140
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,379
restructured to figure out which one
you're using so the solution is used one

141
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,530
line at a time so the computer says I
need a new teaser pics 115 generates and

142
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,070
then next time

143
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:36,659
21 so even if you use proper has a
record of every human is good because

144
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,580
you're using so many different
organizations from the possible

145
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:50,949
functions all the other ideas and maybe
some place based game where you fly

146
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:59,280
around spaceship spaceship is sturdy and
how it works

147
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,310
module

148
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:18,500
here and take the scooper take this put
it there now

149
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,260
reason its slide is this is a great
example of a non standardized

150
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,379
interpretation because everybody can
have a different show but it's all in

151
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,850
modules that's easy to imagine you had a
Christian interviews like this where you

152
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:44,290
can just say I want to use this sha just
drop it into the gully and then I want

153
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:52,450
to use this user library has 56 Okies
you click on that drop it into the

154
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:06,400
questions and did something to spin
around five so I'm trying to understand

155
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:15,110
so the what is happening on the right
side you're taking your same keys and

156
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,740
their decrypting it as a go at it so
it's going across the line

157
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,040
changed its time

158
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,320
ok kids

159
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:35,769
home you know you have people people on
the others so there's little and it has

160
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:44,100
to guess which character which which
equips he's got a series of recipes and

161
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,879
recipe one but I take time stamps would
be used and they were going to square

162
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,140
worry about it

163
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,520
so we're taking some sort of my and then
this client side is having to do a lot

164
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,650
of extra work to figure out what the
math is the server side so thank you to

165
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:19,860
generate about expertise to pass but
that's down the 16 digit number and all

166
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:28,100
the data is the 16th of November 16 by
using it to me then I can decode it

167
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,850
because I have two numbers of encryption
using XOR which I guess is probably the

168
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:40,240
standard is very easy if you can
synchronize your keys but how do you see

169
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,930
or not your keys without the means
driver and that's what I'm trying to fix

170
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,520
it

171
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:54,810
yes how how does it know that it
successfully decrypted that's probably

172
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:06,879
the most important task and go beyond
the last maybe that's almost got two

173
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
things you need to do you need to
synchronize the keys and you need to

174
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:20,559
figure out whether that's what my vote's
most important

175
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,480
and then the computer in with every time
he never remembers server has no

176
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:40,730
preference for what kids get past it any
longer see you next time we have no

177
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:48,970
bunch of duck decoy it's basically I'm
trying to express in my post on the

178
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,190
client side the server is using it he
and then the server changes the key and

179
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,509
the client notices and then the client
searches through all possibilities and

180
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:03,369
the client knows all the possibilities
because previously passed with

181
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:12,449
possibilities to serve clients searches
for all possible permutations and

182
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,850
doesn't find the answer what this is
like the old one possibility is just a

183
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,189
tropical feel like it never received
some really nasty thing to do the

184
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,730
eavesdropper so the eavesdropper really
doesn't know the fermentation window

185
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:38,389
doesn't help big-city permutations to
check and make the packet that does not

186
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,070
mean this

187
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,870
partners

188
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:52,989
with a value make a package that has the
warm and we value every possibility that

189
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,480
you know we will try to limit set of
choice limited choices and then after a

190
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,790
beverage choices trial keep it out but
the eavesdropper won't know that he's

191
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:28,250
trying more and more and more likely
another possibility is one of three or

192
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:37,230
four goals and then there's no using red
round robin past those the data to

193
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,000
different groups tunnels at different
times as long as the client knows what

194
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,360
to look for and how their recent data no
problem we can do this very easily

195
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,530
imagine your knees driver and human are
here to help calm things well it

196
00:25:54,530 --> 00:26:01,928
probably isn't anyone total compensation
so this is meant to be a logistical

197
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:07,650
nightmare and I know you can do the same
thing with a single by reordering the

198
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,670
packets

199
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,540
book day and that you don't care any
client knows how the recent packets the

200
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,720
new missile sequence on the one hand on
the service learning and reading order

201
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,570
to sequence on the clients with the
downside being

202
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:41,860
latency but a lot of course don't you ok
so basically you know the client makes

203
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:54,219
communication partners and passes them
to do whatever whenever he permutation

204
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,210
linda was so that brings up the question
no

205
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:05,450
can we increase our security by using
this independence most of the time you

206
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:18,810
don't have this freedom fighters about
next slide please so for example did in

207
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:28,129
the first people be 64 bits actually he
and in the next 128 this sort he did we

208
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,950
change back and forth in this year's yes
my security personal doesn't care

209
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,980
no server will with its instructions
from the coin and we use any expertise

210
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:49,390
is given any permutation met this given
basically you know it's a computer he'll

211
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,179
follow

212
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:56,019
instructions which means we can change
keys on the fly which measures how

213
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:00,869
frustrating that would be on somebody
who's trying to decode your package no

214
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:07,100
11 months not only the region's the key
chains Vicky's number one package the

215
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:16,998
next possibility is going we are inside
i mean have you ever heard of using city

216
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:23,160
three bits or qubits

217
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:31,760
53 minutes you know we use cookies and
history as he gets the cold gets a

218
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:41,260
little ugly because you haven't we met
his latest reason as a sequence of bits

219
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:47,800
instead of a sequence of bytes then we
can use a hundred and twenty seven bits

220
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:56,430
as a key which we completely mess up
your plate boundaries knows how to

221
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:04,180
reconstruct the bite boundaries it's no
big deal so now that you mention being

222
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,760
used rubber and so many to using the
same day three bits instead of a new

223
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:21,760
simple or not even though that would be
great harm to the maximum size he well

224
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:32,710
knows I'm already 1500 light packets in
the max moves his side he transmitted to

225
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:40,330
the server is surprisingly 1505 we've
needed very large cheese there's really

226
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,649
no

227
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:53,380
packets basically is the maximum queue
size 6 like this ever know why should

228
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,370
they all this effort to prevent teenage
driver from listening to work

229
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:06,300
data and history is Thursday many used
software and information is power so

230
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:12,600
imagine that you know you love your
government and he went to share all your

231
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,030
day with your government I have no
problem but it's not just your

232
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,480
government listening on the Internet

233
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,710
China there is no economic reasons to
listen there's military reasons to

234
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:37,030
listen produced a comeback that you know
information is power power corrupts

235
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,340
there's really no way around that person

236
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:48,389
world's information at your finger tips
when you use the information correctly I

237
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:57,480
probably so in a word you don't always
make the case that is to allow

238
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,190
governments to eavesdrop on you know
that if you love the use a disloyal to

239
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:14,050
let them listen to my relations and vice
versa looks like please means

240
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:21,500
is this nation of sheep will beget a
government of wolves would make is put

241
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:29,340
on the government's a nation of sheep
will beget a many governments are we

242
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,449
really need to protect your day that
this to stop the temptation of other

243
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:50,750
people to see our page report one and
basically no not all groups and has been

244
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,750
built back three large numbers those
million other ways of doing things with

245
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:05,640
my security protocol is based on the
time of the time it takes to solve this

246
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:20,030
message digest which is carefully and
then I switched mode with another turkey

247
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:27,970
and then the client has to find that
explore key by finding that you can use

248
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,520
the moment the aquarium trip

249
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:39,980
duty to serve in the process repeats so
this is a different kind of know how I

250
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:51,830
have a message digest and I have both of
them wrapped up with your eyes do you

251
00:32:51,830 --> 00:33:09,810
think the indy five then you i think is
better and you can think of the data

252
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:17,210
matrix so basically I took some ideas
from quantum mechanics and apply them to

253
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:29,820
the basic Christian this is probably the
most important slide presentation and

254
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:44,770
his just using stuff so imagine I
haven't danced and I take the Indy 500

255
00:33:44,770 --> 00:34:05,290
pretty good one to one ratio so I'm this
and I reported that the packet and then

256
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,420
I send it to

257
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:15,090
the server sent to the client and the
other thing so that the client yes it

258
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:23,790
takes to keep thinks things that should
work trust because the past few years if

259
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:36,040
the client has the wrong he lies in the
in the packet and the only way to get

260
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,540
the condition to be true is by finding
the right here so this is a very clever

261
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:57,100
way if we have a nice and if you're not
synchronized do why this is the whole

262
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:15,529
centerpiece for any questions this point

263
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:56,050
and that's the goal friendly site in
your seat in 1682 you think you can

264
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,990
dance and I look forward to seeing you
next year

265
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:11,479
thank you

266
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:26,580
faster computers are still faster more
frequently in trial keys right yes and

267
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,160
yes

268
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:36,118
always affect what we're doing but the
service properly doing the service

269
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,760
really just following instructions that
screen and we're using those moments of

270
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:54,020
security that disruptions from the
client can I doubt it's any way you can

271
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:03,359
make the presentation and there's really
no driver instructors who know this

272
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:11,950
because of course the data is encrypted
so you can have an i7 max is he on the

273
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:18,600
bright side server is has no CPU load at
all and you could have a very secure

274
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,980
connection despite turning up the CPU
power declined so in that sense it

275
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:38,060
protects it from or small because the
more powerful new clients come about

276
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:45,160
well I had a lot of training I started
many years ago

277
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:53,080
of the CCIE SP security Cisco and then
since then many other things

278
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:11,450
G 00 ideas but there's people make no
this is their lives they do this every

279
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:18,270
day they probably think but I just
wanted to show that anybody can raise

280
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:34,600
protocol there's a lot of problems
