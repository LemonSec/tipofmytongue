1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:19,179
year later he returned to the sea a
recreated for education so what is it

2
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,349
when you care

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:31,400
education program it's raised by a 12
year in high school but we want to start

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:44,680
middle school here gonna start with her
mind and you start with Lego as a

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,510
building and you're making girl parts
machine your impartial metal wanted to

6
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:06,550
get your hands on hardcore by the time
you graduate high school

7
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:22,070
your workforce program any technological
program out there

8
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,800
national

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,880
so happy about classes middle-class
families

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,990
hours to live in a rich neighborhood and
that's because of property tax they

11
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:54,280
think they can be anything they have
future retirees and this is the most

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,670
important they are likely to continue
this all the children that what this is

13
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:24,310
is a cycle continues class and i was
just curious to see what fifty plus

14
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:33,230
hours believe you can they move their
property taxes for 2008 less well-funded

15
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,929
school they're not going to be tired too

16
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:47,760
go into these careers opportunities for
higher education and they're likely to

17
00:02:47,760 --> 00:03:12,489
continue that several because we're
watching less expensive housing

18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:04:00,100
people do that in part because they're
so easy and there's so few resources

19
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,109
the other thing is they have a notion of
childhood should be about kids just be

20
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:13,430
kids and so they go out the back you are
they create games period but they don't

21
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,660
have the advantages that a child in a
little in the upper class would it's

22
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,480
cold today that it has those
opportunities

23
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,830
international financial system

24
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:37,000
unfortunately eighty percent of your
adjusted for free and New York Times as

25
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,220
well as much risk cities in America so
this is not a time shooting people like

26
00:04:46,220 --> 00:05:01,150
we have some of the richest musicians in
the country and if that's how to divide

27
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:12,520
between the city is the rest of the
country but she's going to the Tennessee

28
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,099
so

29
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:32,860
issue last year for the first five years

30
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,590
are with their education

31
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:49,159
pulling apart is hoping to change that
hurdle one of the things I learned very

32
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:55,460
very important things nobody don't know
you don't know I don't think so I know a

33
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,150
lot of things about what to do

34
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:05,179
likes a robust lettuce I don't know
anything about education and therefore I

35
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:19,889
must warn that person is say so many
years this privilege to be requested to

36
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,969
be on this team and this started as a
hack so I'm very pro hac this is a hat

37
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,750
Tennessee should and we had forty
different teams around the room people

38
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,560
the patient different ideas and she
pitched the idea of building robots and

39
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,089
I'm so they're taught the best robotics
team and our school and it's just been

40
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:53,409
amazing and so i thought well ok how we
gonna scare kids for success so we're

41
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:57,190
going to talk about microcontrollers is
one of our students

42
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,340
this construct with making make make
make he was the first thing that we

43
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,880
weren't with its so good because you
don't have to actually do it

44
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,219
the program is basically already there
is a small places to play he is and he

45
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,860
could play and below their website and
then the buttons become whatever it is

46
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,580
you downloaded from its so simple as
something to do that at the same and so

47
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:35,340
we were when we were creating this
amazing thing he was building so we had

48
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:54,049
20 adults lot of adversity that comes
back but we just so you know it just as

49
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:02,620
quickly created a minecraft roller and
so he was able to show this is something

50
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,430
that a child could do my daughter got
involved with it they were playing

51
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,050
microcontrollers all week and that's
where we start and then I was speaking

52
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,150
to the Arduino alert about pick ax so
I'm still in the process of building

53
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,549
that help kids know absolutely nothing

54
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,350
go from here lerman democrat-controlled
Reyes do something with the

55
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,200
microcontroller that works and then
build them up so they're able to program

56
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:38,319
for advanced things so pick ax maybe
madeline is there like 10 bucks are 41

57
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,030
last I should have a bill so we may
actually the building our own Arduino

58
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,040
for its record is another thing that we
were looking at the days when you pair

59
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,540
up it's almost like putting a brain with
nervous system you can make something

60
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,250
very intelligent and very capable at
least capable enough taking out the

61
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,100
trash which is coming from my goals at
home if you want to just will launch

62
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,740
when ever had to do it again so I'm in
the process of learning myself and it's

63
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,020
an awful lot so we're going to teach
along with his introduction to

64
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,810
programming being used is that we're
taking engineer which is what she is

65
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,430
doing way if a child has nothing else to
do and you see the boxer brought to

66
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,530
figure out how to stay in this house
without falling over there gonna build a

67
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:39,439
bridge out anything that they came when
you do the engineering to be able to

68
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,720
bring him over two disciplines like tech
blog

69
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,180
meds when you're working with our play
no one of the languages used routinely

70
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,250
the C++ so that's going to be a great
way to give kids an introduction to what

71
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,860
the ceiling and then we're going to have
a whole other straight and programming

72
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,270
is one of my passions are learning it
when he's the hottest secret until the

73
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,560
source operating room haha oh we used to
little bit of it this weekend it was a

74
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:26,099
great success and which means it's over
you're planning to say this is the

75
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,600
highways rebuilding the skull

76
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:40,860
how to plan out a program that was
really working this is the most

77
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,230
important thing that ever happened to
his house

78
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:56,220
programming language and that's what
happens when alert documentation and

79
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,980
understand the basics of how so

80
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,550
almost every discipline with this you
got engineering you've got you've got

81
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,260
technology the only thing that we're
lacking in we're gonna figure out how to

82
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,890
break it is a little bit of science we
do it covered the engineering design

83
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,390
process which really is just good play
like I did three computers you were

84
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,790
probably doing things like you know I
was upset she constantly trying to build

85
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:38,250
a machine we got trouble and try to
watch it is really the process that a

86
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,590
child goes through when they're playing
investigating we may have to read teach

87
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:47,190
kids how to do this and so we have this
available first historically investigate

88
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,930
what the problem is I want to build
applying should you decide to think that

89
00:11:50,930 --> 00:12:00,239
works created hopefully there's a little
friends say no he will not jump off the

90
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,970
roof of that process is so the

91
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,000
BC of using it in various programs
around the city that engineering process

92
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,680
when I talk robotics is really very
helpful for dealing with all kinds of

93
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,540
problems that can translate over in the
success later recovered basic

94
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,110
engineering has said that we've got some
electronics are going to be part of our

95
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,790
way no other redwoods and things like
that happen we have positive and

96
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,110
negative you're gonna have to understand
how much lower can tell me that's part

97
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,339
of your closest things up first but
hopefully we get the man to understand

98
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,300
what they want you to come pastor why
you need the other electronic components

99
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:56,569
there's gonna be physics and mathematics
all part of this program and not talk

100
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:04,339
the way you know we're not going to give
us our test is going to be can you build

101
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:11,139
a device that links three-wide makes us
a robot

102
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:23,439
or something that will come about
college so it could be just trying to

103
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:36,699
help so no failure and that she would
like to see opportunities to become kind

104
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:46,309
of hackers and you are to be makers and
so is just fine you create these things

105
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,669
and they do something like that was the
entire hack trying to figure out how to

106
00:13:50,669 --> 00:14:01,199
get to do it for 80 years eighteen 18
hours into this and David

107
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,748
we also share is it landed on the moon
was amazing I want that for these kids

108
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:14,029
it's like this robotics but unable to
rate so many other students so makes me

109
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,809
really happy so how can you help us out

110
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,800
well coming up this spring and

111
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,779
lot about teeth so if you want to join
us and help us out we know basic

112
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:38,189
electronics basic programming basic
engineering and are able to help us

113
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,250
build this curriculum could help his
friend today on the component parts I

114
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,459
don't know

115
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,890
process of building my skills I've been
working on it for several years before

116
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,500
will try to me and things are so having
people to understand that have a

117
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:11,700
teacher's heart elvis careful these
jurors so you can do it hardly knows

118
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:20,829
electronics parts of Lagos fantastic
because we want them to let go and we

119
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:27,329
can also remarkably

120
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:36,179
also because we've learned last night
that we can build things going on in

121
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:49,629
justifying so you're not using or may
know somebody quite the opposite in

122
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,279
their house we go out and buy another
one they had 25 might be willing to give

123
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:06,910
us three years but not to make this
privately funded government funds which

124
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:25,889
was one of the largest homeless people
it's and I got after it

125
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:39,519
we saw one that I was their parents and
teachers may differ to some of those

126
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,649
passionate it's very hard to be
passionate about the subject to these

127
00:16:44,649 --> 00:17:00,350
just just thought you ask somebody
please tell should be so yeah we want to

128
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:08,890
be able to make this success where these
kids and 222 forces from 13 hands on

129
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:17,010
these problems that were actually and
that is accomplished

130
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:24,119
where they're cheering and jumping up
and down about something that they must

131
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:33,489
know somebody who knows somebody will
help us out you know somebody who knows

132
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,560
somebody who probably has a casual but
those larger than anything goes for you

133
00:17:39,560 --> 00:18:00,169
probably know somebody needs to be the
coolest willing to give us probably read

134
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:15,640
the work place so I will make sure we
are facing the USA and that they love

135
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,460
the way they plan

136
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,710
a dream that they are using this thing
off the ground and he had her daughters

137
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,039
if you're willing to talk their way you
can become film makers base we have

138
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,210
people who are willing to match the
donations and there for this to be a

139
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,250
part of their makers that's pretty to be
able to partner with them but it's also

140
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,070
really important that we had a great
city should have when they say they will

141
00:18:43,070 --> 00:19:03,439
let me have become so we want to be able
to take her seven say what can we do to

142
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:15,570
play with this creating together to
study

143
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,470
way

144
