1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:14,809
unit on Tuesday and I ingress it is it
is more than just the language so we're

2
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:20,929
going to be talking about how cool
glasses originally painted some of the

3
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:30,659
data they use got a new items ninety
they were playing so how many you are

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,380
familiar why

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,740
actually and the reason is not an
accident visit Google glass they want to

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:48,640
find other places like they want to buy
this

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,950
well as you say that you have our youth
leader something like that he wanted

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:02,560
people to come there and gathered there
and so people making your points a game

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,880
worthy of that location that you can go
even going to be registered so they want

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,429
to get into

11
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:35,869
so far as I can tell the bus and blue
team beans team inside yes it's actually

12
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:45,440
like our

13
00:01:45,440 --> 00:02:57,829
what are you trying to say here this
morning actually starts so we will

14
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:17,240
audience participation as you like to
talk to you live more about adding and

15
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:34,340
lay down or I'll tell you that we
totally are and then came on Tuesdays

16
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:58,900
and Fridays so I can guarantee was no
excuse you should have been here for you

17
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,310
always

18
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:15,530
he he he he is the leader of the group

19
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,940
realistically since that Mars not gonna
be here for about 25 minutes will

20
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,340
hopefully start again the official
English panel by thirty for those of you

21
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,119
who would like to embarrassed at more
for being late we will continue to do

22
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,930
this portion will edit it in the most
amusing life and I would love to help

23
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:49,620
audience participation in question of
course we'll ask everyone this is what

24
00:04:49,620 --> 00:05:00,370
happened if you aren't on time for your
free page was ok so I was being dead

25
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,700
serious about being there is the
rebellion or something like that induces

26
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:30,270
the inspired power and they've always
known about this and it resisted knows

27
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,020
that they have to give him

28
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:43,150
and you're able to give these points
results or situations actually was

29
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:56,020
organized in New York one thing that is
true is that it was created as a way of

30
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:06,258
buying data last week Mr John Podesta
president resigned as want to play out

31
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,770
back is 100% completely totally
irrationally growing light months I

32
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:42,448
think that margot should be resisted I
think so we really think about yourself

33
00:06:42,449 --> 00:07:15,470
question is did to me

34
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:26,480
120 years in the job approval of it when
you want to know about how I actually

35
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:51,370
believed to be greedy I showed a little
bit for the nightmare is the worst ever

36
00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:11,969
read it had to add your this is really
great

37
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:41,188
laughing boy dat rights for I started
doing whether dole when I was 15 I had

38
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:59,500
it was another fourteen year olds and I
major in something totally unrelated and

39
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,410
I really think that is one of the best
things and the reason is that it makes

40
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,120
things in tactically

41
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:23,309
basically instead of adding but if it
did you know these things we did say

42
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:44,600
drop down or you can say whatever they
may be one reason for John

43
00:09:44,600 --> 00:10:05,319
and so since these are basically had and
he can stand of 72 Tom BUIS 18 thinking

44
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:21,660
of something like that and you know i
three great so if you want to get into

45
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,149
that game you look forward for the
Internet should be we had a hand out

46
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:36,769
these 5 alright well this is a tool that
we have and we're doing this we're

47
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,750
really looking backwards while you are
driving and you looking in the rearview

48
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,480
mirror

49
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:59,540
basically breasts are people actually
improving standards are you get a new

50
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,370
number plate

51
00:11:00,370 --> 00:12:27,209
literally means that they do so that's
why you should say that it hasn't

52
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:37,449
changed and it's always been true for
you

53
00:12:37,450 --> 00:13:22,040

the exist and duties and is there any

58
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:09,870

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:51,970
together sometime my his course you know
giant black and chocolate and I was

125
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,270

127
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:35,390
job sites

128
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:45,000
you know johnny has yeah he's always had
living on thirty basically we got

129
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:57,549
together for a while how did we start
getting to classical music and DJs for

130
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:20,130
some time to he was trying to take WAV
files and such classics like he wanted

131
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:55,269
and that's fine that's not the only one
so I was just trying to record digitally

132
00:40:55,269 --> 00:41:10,689
and fifteen years there's nobody in this
and we've been doing this for years so I

133
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:44,979
recently we started out on the HP 20 to
see just to please say yes we must work

134
00:41:44,979 --> 00:42:08,859
in 10 years

135
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:49,680
point together and there was actually I
think it was much more so when I have

136
00:42:49,680 --> 00:43:12,779
wifi card and social network called Fox
32 download files from it doesn't have

137
00:43:12,779 --> 00:43:30,680
nearly enough capability to be used
textbooks

138
00:43:30,680 --> 00:46:10,460
ok

139
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:58,050
