5
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:27,629

it and did it again and so I had the

6
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:44,620
type that never have actually had to
give it to someone to her older version

7
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:52,319

10
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:45,760

11
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,450
saw one down on my computer

12
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:03,290

at the computer and won the cables loose

13
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:15,940
ball game could push it back in the red

14
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,440
and this legislation just happening
later

15
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:36,600

that because I was down about three
years it's sort of like and the egg up

17
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:32,770

18
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:42,969
different machine and

19
00:05:42,969 --> 00:06:20,219
