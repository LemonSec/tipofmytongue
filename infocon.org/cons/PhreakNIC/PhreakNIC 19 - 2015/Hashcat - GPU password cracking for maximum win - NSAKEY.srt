1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:10,490
enhance your enthusiasm for those who
don't know what that is is very cheesy

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:22,100
example of aids yard and all along
because I think true warnings need to be

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,810
made fun of like boilerplate language
included a trigger warning in this and

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,930
probably will in all future
presentations all this talk was designed

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:45,230
in the following the passwords user Andy
pulling selectors John users and

6
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:52,059
developers you have no other groups
while another year but there's more to

7
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:53,019
do with it

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:02,430
John River yes I actually enjoyed his
job development diet thing like the bill

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:13,299
so yeah we make fun of John it's like a
regular Joes on IRC me has dado tester

10
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,260
who are so doing this

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,950
doing the research that under this
presentation I actually found a couple

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:28,490
and and of the main developer whose life
here is Esther you're finding stuff we

13
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,610
should have found on her own

14
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,030
more idols and the problem I also really
torch relay and bridges if you were in

15
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,550
the XMPP talked earlier

16
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:48,410
team next year you already heard about
the plan not affiliated with the NSA oh

17
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,090
that's not some kind of weird double
plus I barely there were 48 miles

18
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:04,530
because I'm awesome director here and
the guys and they pretty much told him

19
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,550
he can't come because my handle is
safety in my email addresses room speed

20
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,300
up calling and in the same time your
program at the factory to let their

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:28,730
bowels provocation I told you so voters
spooks and their enablers and all of

22
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,440
that committee pretty hard and he
actually told me on Twitter that he

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,400
thinks I'm a troll

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:47,650
i dont trust anybody when I Dutra we're
going to do to get at Roland job let me

25
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:56,959
know this is the telephone talents lie
unspoiled the basics of what he would

26
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:10,250
bother doing this and generally how
about that because I really needs and

27
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,630
you can you can download the slides
later but more time to do some analysis

28
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,890
taking any questions

29
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:29,958
this is this is the scariest season ok
exploration to do battle field is

30
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:38,360
released in 2011 I actually did all my
testing all that feature at the time

31
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,590
that was like three years old

32
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:49,290
there's no chance he'll new password on
the bones I didn't so there is no bonus

33
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:59,130
lied on his dresser that done early last
year or early this year in January this

34
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:09,049
year actually and they were deviance and
store all their passes next year 2011

35
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:19,620
2014 top 10 classed as they mostly top
25 most common passwords and as a little

36
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,080
pastors lot of states this is terrified
I know but only about this is the

37
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:44,479
dumbest person like you have the you and
they don't like 23456 everyone else is

38
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:53,568
slightly more intelligent but that's
what president presentations

39
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:59,599
I was going to talk about why the hell
anyone would bother doing any of this

40
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,360
oh there's security research whether
it's for your company internally like

41
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,020
did later or externally like this
investigation or anything like that

42
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,568
oh there's a guy or are stable Nate
Anderson

43
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:26,300
article about my experience getting
hands that's how I became a password

44
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,649
cracker there are various cruelty
committed a lot of people would probably

45
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:37,770
without they didn't read this article
but he covers a lot of good drill and

46
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,948
then there's his password recovery which
is basically geared for law enforcement

47
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:50,860
asking for a show of hands or anything
you do not need any backdoor run tours

48
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:58,519
arranged this legal framework of that
just brute force everybody feels that's

49
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:11,519
just plain bad reason this is one of my
favorites lies checking mostly so send

50
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,689
me an email that they will first thing
else

51
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:31,209
in just 15 and yeah that that's a thing
and then my personal favorite earnings

52
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:51,619
which really just using striptease for
sure and public service this is the

53
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:58,499
first time around what is a password

54
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:06,569
basically it's 110 in this situation is
just organized words just heading plain

55
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:15,110
text structure idiots basically the
whole idea is that it could spread then

56
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:22,069
passes are reusable and advice for users
a little bit of time change your passes

57
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:28,569
unless you're really stupid knew
something like something william was

58
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:38,689
born just like straight

59
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,629
echo a string and again be five some of
those of you who are Linux users and

60
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:49,529
yeah that's just not good at all that
sort of behavior was acceptable back in

61
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,379
the seventies don't do it

62
00:07:53,379 --> 00:08:02,449
salting started to become thing i dont
removal in the brain the tables were

63
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:08,950
designed basically just to preview the
budget passes and then

64
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,620
waiting CPU time 'cause nobody's video
tour of the files in their play text

65
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:26,390
equivalents in the problem being that I
am rainbow tables kind of God's Word by

66
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:33,080
salt which low-level standpoint you have
a string of texts that gets into the

67
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:52,250
word and then 2012 and generate a lot of
the better algorithms he's also just how

68
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:00,840
many times runs before you get the
correct as well just really worried as

69
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:17,410
true that there's nothing that's like he
did to the algorithm they don't use guns

70
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:28,400
some examples that are all color slide
ok but the light blue that's just so

71
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:39,980
bright green is salt and where I have
read zero day is actually just the

72
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,240
number of iterations now that is
actually an exponent that actually runs

73
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:56,030
256 times by three times so on and all
of these days of work out oh and in case

74
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,670
anyone is going ask later

75
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,370
standard for beetroot these days is a
workout

76
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:15,620
twill gotten all the news has cancer
password cracker

77
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:26,440
plain Jane SKU CPUs and I know you're
not going to use Facebook actually asked

78
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,330
that I just feel like telling it in case
you need you actually go download it and

79
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:40,360
you don't have to endure and made some
offer whatever oziel hands is the AMD

80
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:51,470
version for graphics cards desk and he's
the Nvidia version Indies implementation

81
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,640
of its terrible that's probably all
purpose because they're so there are

82
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:12,949
there to buy CD but still 140 so change
and anybody who likes you can build a

83
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:29,200
single cluster fuck 228 you can do so
doesn't care

84
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,770
title of the talks had better find
original slide the way it was presented

85
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,600
in eight by twenty five characters talk
about the GPU versions because only the

86
00:11:44,600 --> 00:12:00,870
CD version which brings me to exploit
this is Joe Black Cat the movie the rest

87
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,550
of you you didn't miss

88
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:17,519
so you're going to sleep here that you
see director really has no basis in

89
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:34,510
reality this may have been in 1993 I can
probably as nicely as all of these five

90
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:46,560
and just basically to the mall and its
employees into longer than its alright

91
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:58,619
cool store that the real reason is GPUs
have lots of little dumb just see you

92
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:07,399
were more complicated functions really
can be broken out and that's where the

93
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:17,990
speaking real world example I don't have
no

94
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:38,880
alright I've got it and ended a
three-day do I tried to 400 million

95
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,750
tries per second with TV video card
that's really not advocate for the job

96
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:55,770
it's inadequate but it still vastly
better than my CPU hardware because i

97
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:05,829
dont really fantastic right 00 there's
also talk by evil dirty on he said this

98
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,470
hilarious had john is talking about
extending rigs on fire

99
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,050
Laureus

100
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,779
passwords dogs but it's it's definitely
worth watching I think it's about half

101
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:32,220
hour but I will touch on this is what we
call of reference design car that's

102
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,670
basically what you would find on the
website now these are actually the same

103
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:50,829
card when it's just that in this case I
think they took and $50 difference

104
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:57,310
I can't remember which doesn't belong
there is just corner cutting for gamers

105
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:06,010
will assume you're gonna be running 24 7
365 and you want to spend $50 on the

106
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,930
real thing

107
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:15,729
assembly otherwise you end up with fires
like brand new cars go with India and

108
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:23,970
Indians you remember about two years ago
when do you mind was thing before the

109
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:33,570
difficulty when everybody by in the body
of the TLDR version takes their

110
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,720
architectural deficiencies and at the
same time with the same cars in Newark

111
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,980
takes to that end to the power in half
over what agencies knew about the same

112
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,390
for its own use as much electricity
which means no burnout PCI slots no

113
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,250
fires

114
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:03,230
most of the baby is it the thing though
is there only like 3 beta testers for

115
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:10,380
video cards as last time I checked one
of the first one is a guy who made our

116
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,250
stay ago few years back for making
insurance IDP rig that forget how many

117
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,449
billions of has percent

118
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:26,479
and then there's me yeah it's kinda sad
state of affairs but these were slowly

119
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:39,649
story by ok this is this is my new free
means that I get the burden stairwell it

120
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,359
will meet this slide right here and what
I have to say

121
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:53,350
mining rig that is just collecting dust
and you use it for cracking passwords

122
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,309
you have to follow certain steps take
every person take everything out of the

123
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:06,408
military or parades take the train back
to the gas station from yes unless you

124
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:12,679
have another use for any separated into
two files takes your breath cards and

125
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,529
things that was not cheesy everything
else another bottle you build your

126
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:32,010
trading room that that fire because it's
burned anyways and you might slow down

127
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,190
or earlier

128
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:41,610
substance for the days when dinosaurs
roamed the earth he was given he was

129
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:55,620
fighting for and he got 87 percent they
were so everything every truncated

130
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,830
and was easily deceived you with John
River

131
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:13,418
for specific optimizations he got about
10,000 tries for second in and around

132
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:19,380
our forward-looking multiple blamed on
to something that really start to pay

133
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,529
attention to the last couple of years

134
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:32,769
alright for only benchmark funds are
used any invoice with the combined for

135
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:39,340
my car died Aug 16 PTI which is anyone
has heard about it is hilariously

136
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:47,720
inadequate for the job it was like 150
bucks two years ago its words and hiring

137
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,289
mentioned I would love that because
there were so many unique in these files

138
00:18:53,289 --> 00:19:01,360
it says here idk but there's always like
there's like 423,000 which still it

139
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:11,289
wasn't this the Syrian electronic army
and didn't feel like I did you like you

140
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:18,320
like that was significant roles as
promised that I just used socks until

141
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,919
later when I see what I could create

142
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:29,950
I'm used to carrying which is really
popular it's kind of the go to work

143
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,670
until something else comes close

144
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,520
sites they're not publish it

145
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:48,150
human only guy his name is Taylor or me
he knows that 2010 could text passwords

146
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:56,190
passwords and I'll have the ties them
it's ok it's kind of like taking a

147
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:10,230
shotgun to inspire them but words and
they have certain restrictions and

148
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:22,670
guidelines and 2012 has done and I
forget the name of the other site this

149
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:35,010
really matter and greg did 2014 2010 and
hold them difference between the two is

150
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,470
hopeful about the original Holywell
competitions which turned out to be

151
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,270
noisy and you'll see I got brian
Sandoval percent higher by using the two

152
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:59,660
over probably talked about attack types
in general this is an area which

153
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,640
basically that the best way and said

154
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,830
is to take any passes for previous data
breaches

155
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:17,340
even when you do that kind of decision
your car still runs high temperature

156
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,909
still the justices just saying it won't
be a part of all it's it's pretty much

157
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:35,570
like space heater over but valid a
thousand words after I don't trust has

158
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,320
to find things correctly which I
actually heard that and that's the whole

159
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:49,399
reason I'm instead of beta tester
earlier and validate my style is pretty

160
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,120
much how I came to ask me later but
surely

161
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,260
condition that is adding changing
capitalization and truncating the last 2

162
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:12,970
characters and it was only like one in
every 10,000 passwords in with your

163
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:19,370
health and if I complete my forty
glasses sold for just a minute you're

164
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:30,350
into the dc-area tanks are going to be
betrayed me only way to even do anything

165
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:38,699
until his password cracking because once
a dictionary attacks against all the for

166
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,450
example the Ashley Madison featured as a
no lose our stories some functions

167
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:52,760
Elite eight decades just around the
rocky centuries to run iraq attacks than

168
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,379
that so many reasons future anyways

169
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:17,769
28 2012 and 35.7 he made his base in
progress since most people don't use

170
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:31,929
passwords for 600 even know what has
gotten way better we will actually get

171
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:45,600
28 told us it just takes place had a
similar problem I'm gonna talk about

172
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,689
commentators you must accept that it
tried every combo of words judiciary you

173
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,559
can also carries with something protest
hate utils

174
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,908
show of hands he's heard I swear

175
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:10,789
making the best workers ok two people
died in the year it's about a half hour

176
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:17,549
it's really comprehensive guide covers
it will and he also thinks its research

177
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,470
dot com which is just like a repository
of white neighbors passwords for those

178
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,950
who are into reading next big thing

179
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,850
commentators you can apply what has or
the other half

180
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:38,469
the dictionaries and then there's a rule
of thumb in a little higher than special

181
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:45,350
characters all in other fun stuff just
getting things together

182
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:54,530
testing and i think im just say taking
entirely too long the next lie detector

183
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:03,480
alot of fun by systems right now you're
like me and track their words basically

184
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,140
and simply won't do is change the
dictionary and something else then tries

185
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,750
that and you can find a lot more stuff
just doing that you can also combine

186
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:27,059
multiple leads to be a little more rules
than others similarly the rules as well

187
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:34,629
something else making wise but of course
the time grows exponentially as you do

188
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:50,929
that Adam is John river cruise news best
rules rules are John and passwords probe

189
00:25:50,929 --> 00:26:00,289
has the same will I think john thinks I
think I have some examples at the bottom

190
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:07,260
just using the polish dries all over
these past modification I think you guys

191
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,679
to read i guess im trying to move won't
hear all of these passwords were from

192
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:21,830
the start you why do you use GPUs I
really have to explain this because I

193
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,559
had like five lbs

194
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:44,509
to NZ grass or terror group's name
sometimes it's more the rules and never

195
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:51,639
even bothered to do this and list their
names and doesn't care

196
00:26:51,639 --> 00:27:07,139
alright a 64 is also a little over by
contrast you have done download the top

197
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:17,969
just under two hours before I guess it
will be up for download the whole

198
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:28,909
reversal for those who analyzed the day
he's a little bit of you calculate the

199
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:35,840
percentage was until all of the stuff
across town

200
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:48,850
26 tracks I got an 81 points to close to
meeting the challenge but a more money

201
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:59,080
says the first eighty percent of the
last twenty percent that's just as a

202
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:10,389
rule about this year they were wrong to
make sure I will talk to really

203
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:17,850
understand it just clueless preview

204
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:27,350
got hit on the head with a large last 20
years because we have such a rich body

205
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:43,870
of knowledge with how passes we can make
this strength that explained that detail

206
00:28:43,870 --> 00:29:00,840
and the other day I will just be no one
else and said well as lower case and the

207
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:10,820
DS digit in mind about working
environment minimum required for

208
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,429
passwords

209
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:30,090
this is your gym right here that ok
uppercase lowercase simulator that but

210
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:41,840
mostly they're so you can change as hell
and you're good to go

211
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:50,379
increment and decrement the number of
cells century 24 cents you can also if

212
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,150
you feel like doing other languages you
can specify custom character sets for

213
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:17,330
your into they need maybe don't there so
I asked a comes with us in that sense by

214
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,439
the best buy the fall I landed the first
three because by the time like that and

215
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,520
I realized the other three would take me
forever and I actually read these and

216
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:38,940
this was done last year another movie
finished I start another way to go to

217
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,360
bed

218
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:50,310
starting back to the I determine the
proxy rules it was going to take

219
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,700
entirely too long

220
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:58,380
and I say let's run the numbers and then
challenged decided screw it I'm moving

221
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:31,900
north didn't you like less drama winner
starting electric bills

222
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:54,990
we'll get to that later

223
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:07,070
schedule he had to cancel out he is
doing this presentation and you're all I

224
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:20,970
will be a good addition he said
treasurer 87 is now that I've gotten

225
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:32,380
that out of the way I was kind of lost
her moans and I thought what can I do

226
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,940
next

227
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:42,720
so I don't know that both the holy wow
this too would and I generate custom

228
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:51,910
rules the first rule was first holy
wells the bites and Holywell to generate

229
00:32:51,910 --> 00:33:02,860
I sorted by popularity and instruct me
to 48 gigs and will be respected and

230
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,350
then start for those few the uninitiated
as a lot of the UNIX that's pretty much

231
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,790
what kind of environment

232
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:21,879
yeah yeah yeah I can sleep I see this
sunset standing

233
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:33,990
terminal in my brain even with all of
that I still so you can really tell I

234
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,210
really really getting into the land of
diminishing returns and there are rules

235
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:46,090
bridge alright this is an entirely
different explanation

236
00:33:46,090 --> 00:34:02,350
third column prime percentage is that's
before this is just using rock is the

237
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:10,000
leading unchanged was rules like the
least one person has died down rules the

238
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,840
same number of lines and i just want to
see if I can do

239
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:21,970
line-by-line what was designed to exceed
what has kept the 64 that was

240
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,040
hilariously terrible

241
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,949
64 was hydride optimized and competition
from the community so I didn't really

242
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:41,168
expect to see did just a few fractions
of a percent again

243
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:46,279
v2 is a lot smaller the better because
it doesn't have transformed

244
00:34:46,280 --> 00:35:03,760
decisions and not understand you raised
the stories of love trust is all about

245
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,570
that I decided maybe I should do this
with Massachusetts too so I used the

246
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:23,720
script and i dont no less than a
thousand matches just don't just jump in

247
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:36,629
Norway's so really Lawrence says case
and I think I don't think twenty years

248
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:47,940
518 million combinations kind of tells
says on there and there's no power plant

249
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,330
it

250
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:57,520
33317 which is what it would take to try
all of those six Mons is no fault in

251
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,990
here

252
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:09,680
ok no more lasting love boat about these
numbers he was true he used a couple of

253
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,490
school 3 a.m. in the morning

254
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:28,490
I decided oh hey I'm just so

255
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:41,209
universe Holywell 125 right now what's
really funny is lots of intelligence

256
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:50,780
will lead to her less time and I say
that because the deal has overnight you

257
00:36:50,780 --> 00:37:01,810
since 2001 was another reason I think
I'm glad you mentioned earlier or easily

258
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:10,160
chances of finding something really at
risk and that turned out to be true

259
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:25,410
doing something a little dated but then
they would take everything they found

260
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:31,779
the attacks again which might probably
in single-digit numbers just from my

261
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:38,410
personal experience when they do the
nineties and communities heading now and

262
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:47,799
use is also a test yet already in there
actually strips out there for doing just

263
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,590
that

264
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:56,960
generating dictionary with you more
losses they are rather glory selling

265
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,820
project were held which one that does ok
let's say you I don't know what's going

266
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,239
on

267
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:14,689
websites that was seriously I don't
bother but I'm sure there was a website

268
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:22,949
for the website it once treatable the
words for example battlefields you

269
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:29,269
remember all the top 10 slide that was
one of the top 10 passes and you do it

270
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:39,468
was any specific things has a common
thing that's related to the science that

271
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:46,289
they used that Abdullah with Ashley
Madison they used the report is coming

272
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:59,359
passes that was a grueling who cares
what is at stake here he comes from

273
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:14,659
Berlin of a person like that that's why
I didn't surprise her guiding this by

274
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:15,799
toxic is done

275
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:21,119
talks about it's basically just
inserting other words I kind of color

276
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:30,819
that so I don't have to explain it as
trends and then you guys ask me

277
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:38,279
questions and hopefully able to answer
them I just hope it and there's no

278
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:51,639
presentations kind of blamed as you can
see all of your passwords and my

279
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,069
personal experience

280
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:59,190
six character passwords

281
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,319
it just seems really involved well in
this case six to 10 because the users

282
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:16,819
were slightly dumber than your average
users just error since used lower than

283
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:29,839
something you can look at it from
getting pictures you have time to 3% is

284
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:42,339
kind of depressing this is one of my
favorites I love this so much so

285
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:57,349
birds just just didn't understand that
earlier that is just my personal

286
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:17,630
favorite is the bird is live in shoulder
service I guess so when can we explain

287
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:29,930
that this is just another way of going
on here this is like running past prime

288
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:36,890
pollen and just make you file I was
advised

289
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,969
talk somewhere else that I should do
some pollutants so here is the

290
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:54,289
obligatory if you're a developer used to
always tell your other managers and

291
00:41:54,289 --> 00:42:04,039
developers til the end he doing

292
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:16,749
developers with users regularly generate
all major organs to text file this case

293
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:29,808
mainland you guys were given to so maybe
they talking about their other

294
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:42,530
undesirables nature something like that
would be good and in just a year

295
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:52,610
you guys know that sucks does 4096 round
shot by the fall on the password for the

296
00:42:52,610 --> 00:43:04,560
container you can adjust that is kinda
scary is basically just screwed on the

297
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:19,200
Bible productions year ago I do I do I
test and then I did so in 2006 so I went

business cards so they had they done

302
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:04,590
alice is a little bit of beauty here or
there are references to stop and get

303
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:13,690
into the very bottom easy sex lies and
lies about firing developers and others

304
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,500
before coming here but yeah all of this
stuff

305
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,779

sites down in the past and take the job

310
00:45:43,069 --> 00:46:49,509
I do not own

311
00:46:49,509 --> 00:47:48,039
presentation and cultures but it's not
like they're really good enough just

312
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:53,479
like one-liners basically but but but
unlike an actual effort

313
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:58,009
doing something that's worth using
multiple people are not aware of this

314
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:11,739
but if you find something like that let
me know those guys rule as hell is my
