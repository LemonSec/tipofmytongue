1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,560

yeah were showing up for a free day and
for viewing

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,710
the maybe you should see injury was mean
age

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,309
I'm before I actually

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,810
come by my a so obviously a lot of
interesting things have happened over

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,590
the past couple months then

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,380
but perhaps someone relevant you think
comets that I may or may not have made

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,710
this conference over the longer term
time

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,090
that happens be here a but before I i
talk about those things

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,700
I have is other a haha comment

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,190
you need me up I each you

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,370
I asked the audience porno one-member
all

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,530
it's good to have a backup excellent
thank you sir I'm

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,340
so well I i wanna talk about something
else

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,160
I am the show I think that some Lawrence
Lessig

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,959
preagreed comments has started this
group called

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,579
re strikers Andrew strikers is basically

18
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,980
that they're still good is that for
everyone to have to get the bridge is a

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,050
people there are like you very few that
are strictly in

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,020
okay and and his contacts for that
observation

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,500
is the idea that the root of the problem
is that our democratic processes

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,090
broke a that the politicians that we are
electing are not necessarily responsive

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,980
to be morning

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,840
and their at the reason for that is that
it's very expensive to run for office

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,890
you're going to run for office you have
to raise money

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,390
fortunately does not the case that
there's a direct correlation between the

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,810
amount of money that you spend

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,230
in your home a billion people but there
is some bees like that you have to reach

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,440
in order to be a viable hear them and
that the site is very high

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,009
and and so you were to reach that in
fortunate leaders replica

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,260
nurtures the Weatherbys like he's going
higher and higher and so murderous that

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,880
baseline

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,640
you have to go out and raise money from

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,770
from wealthy donors who are investing in

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,660
controlling government none and you know
even when you get into office

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,610
you know your first day your YouTube
voters start raising money no

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,679
international action are not be relied

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,700
and so you the reality is that money has
a huge

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,399
includes online you were twins just and
so

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,230
you know the question is what can we do
about that and I think that

41
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,179
that time we need to teach people

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,459
about you tried she value wage

43
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,080
%uh YouTube he added are emerging
timmy's us

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,720
and I'm you know that the reality is
that there are

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,790
multiple in is the show up under ballot
and you should look into that orange

46
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,829
a lot about I you should spend some time
researching office evidence

47
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,239
you make the decision about your in
order to do that you need objective

48
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,500
information resources

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,060
you need to use them so a couple years
ago

50
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,750
bonehead and bring the measure does the
call will be murdered right now sitting

51
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,420
here

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,829
I'm and what you better drive his

53
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,730
I'll basically go to our website great
years it was for

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,149
and we'll tell you who's running for
office in your next election I'm

55
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,650
and then you click on their names
together we can hear from our so you can

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,530
use to you

57
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,260
document you know different politicians
running for office and so

58
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,140
is a is a it surprised I think that you
know in spite of all the drama

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,559
around with the media that action does a
good job I'm actual information on

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,870
sewn I i think is a good resource is a
resource that is not

61
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,110
controlled by a particular persons
agenda

62
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,950
album in behind you dead and

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,170
there's actually a subs there's no
there's another he said we were going to

64
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,890
have to %um

65
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,958
a try to provide protect the users with
human beings

66
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,350
as a as a long popping into my community
was also talking to Bri

67
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,620
years I'm much I am anyway the

68
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,989
the yeah to I I don't know

69
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,420
recent events have 'em I cost me to be
even more cynical and jaded about

70
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,010
politics that I was redrawn

71
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,858
itself I don't talk about that butter

72
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,040
you know I still think that you know
with you tonight has some potential in

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,048
terms of creating

74
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,269
a resource that he will be used to
research political and reason to reach

75
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,040
free even

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,690
do we the people think it's really about
you know he wants a different kind of

77
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,029
country is really about us

78
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,219
is it's not about them process we have
to change the way we approach things

79
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,690
we'd be every month and so we've got to
find out the right model is for people

80
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,290
to follow

81
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,690
provide a week ball so I'm so I'm

82
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,610
I'm running this day and I celebs 501 3c
on Cherry

83
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,940
and you can actually I'm so infuriated
some work during my interview no one has

84
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,690
ever done that

85
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,540
they could write that tradition of is a
as a tax deduction I have a tax ID

86
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,240
number

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,300
and i actually up I'm some here's the
problem in order to redeem my

88
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,520
513 status I have to raise a certain
amount of money

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,770
problem a and I I actually haven't
bothered to do not because I'm buying

90
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,340
everything and it's not very expensive
for me to do what I'm doing

91
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,020
but I have you ever been a really nice
task ahead

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,940
that has to be important for for things
that I'm to you future

93
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,620
show

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,860
I know this is lame but I'm gonna sit
around watching if you have a couple

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,610
blocks

96
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,170
and you understand your humor I and
you're willing to you to use for my

97
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,910
efforts he would really be appreciated

98
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,180
because up if I can tell the IRS that I
have it back

99
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,010
raising money from the public then they
will continue to allow humanitarian

100
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm edge if you wanna make a
tax-deductible donation he won't mind

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,969

105
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,120
also be donated to Project Vote Smart
right most part is a very important

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,510
non-profit charity

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,080
that that I have a %uh they the higher
budget intruders who actually go out and

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,050
not the people that are running for
office

109
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,390
different histories all across the
country and every central database of

110
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,580
all this information

111
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,070
who's running for office so it's a
really great object resource about his

112
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,020
right robbers

113
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,280
and the hadith talent they were
operating under

114
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,460
and then gave all a bit to burn email is
over teammate of

115
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,659
was running a pyramid scheme and lost
all the money that was being used to

116
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,720
operate proposed

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,979
so they are in a bad financial position
up so you know I said a percentage of

118
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,169
the money that I am

119
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,299
collecting will go to propose martini
any

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,010
additional money that we have about our
expenses over 100 bucks for

121
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,449
and purchase price is very high

122
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,979
users I'm so anyway that's my that's my

123
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,150
dreary bars there's a couple people to
their heads up some stuff for six

124
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,438
branches are trained to

125
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,949
just really really fast cash on your
final 23

126
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,059
that you're probably journey you don't

127
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:43,509
years

128

attracted to you

171
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,980
astronaut rusty grievance committee but
I i think that the community has matured

172
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,810
to give you the past four years I think
there's a lot of people in this

173
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,410
community

174
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,350
are involved you're screwed back and are
often on seaside

175
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,620
a the trenches 01 as the

176
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,120
as they did for up assume a lot of
people in this community receives are

177
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,140
treasures as ASEAN same particularly
with respect to things like

178
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,319
Cyrus P so on Thursday yours

180
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,140
was really want to have a good
relationship why I'm March

181

on

182
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,020
busy time I think that used I wish we
don't really recognize the value this

183
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,710
community

184
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,290
does not understand why this community
is back

185
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,459
and I think this is really important and
I i think that

186
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,060
there's been this I'm there's a constant
thing that everyone brings out that if

187
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,020
you're not doing anything wrong you have
nothing to hide

188
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,949
a writers would laugh at that

189
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,950

speed run a

191
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,700
people genuinely don't understand why

192
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,730
that is a problem yeah I think that I'm
it relates shoes %uh the back to the

193
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,520
establishment doesn't understand why

194
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,990
mysterious I'm this community is not
valuable because people in this

195
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,660
community are

196
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,219
worker who's the only people in a place
that is bullshit

197
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,140
his yet we we have universities in this
country to produce

198
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,199
use words Street have to consume is not
simply backers

199
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,550
it is easy matter respected the people
in this community are valuable

200
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,839
because they are handed she all but more
so because they look at the problem from

201
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,920
a different way

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,069

you mean ceding other people couldn't
see

236
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,990
they're incredibly important and Ashley

237
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,210
once you job has given the world is by

238
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,520
feeling the squeeze opportunities for
innovation

239
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,850
that had a tremendous impact on the wall
that we we've all secured

240
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,150
and that I people are for what we all
try to do my purchases whose

241
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,939
news you try refining those places where
we can see the world from a different

242
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,510
perspective now

243
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,120
there are um some think about

244
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,700
a social here there's a line in this day
and break between

245
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,910
on what is socially acceptable behavior
is normal be

246
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,980
and be here that is not sold be here
does not work back

247
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,240
up subtle on also line between making
related

248
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,950
legal and be heard that is leave rights
let alone

249
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,860
and that we also know that there's a
line between maybe your dad is

250
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,590
is are not malicious be here that use
malicious behavior that is

251
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,370
your your back I'm we know that these
reminds

252
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,720
are in different places so you know
obviously there's a desire to make them

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,250
see

254
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,700
but it's calm so of nurses decision
between to hear that is

255
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,290
example be who that is legal leader that
is

256
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,170
whose malicious alright soon to give you
an example

257
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,530
a you know us marijuana's a great
example smoking marijuana

258
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,990
not militia smoking marijuana designer
army buddy

259
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,510
is legal clued in CS in the space
between

260
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,050
what is losing her delicious what is
what is legal

261
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,199
I'm is Joe you know there are many
things that

262
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,730
my pieces space between what is with his
so they may be leaving all the way back

263
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,790
to search for example

264
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,680
so for example you know being homosexual
was legal

265
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
fortunately but it is not necessary for
clues on on

266
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,069
some even society's desire

267
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,390
jus control bed malicious he here

268
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm often this gallon wine is

269
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,060
drawn in different places sometimes
behavior which is not inherently

270
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,000
malicious

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,160
is nonetheless the Eagle it is legal
because I used hundred-bed

272
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,170
people from human beings there that are
harmful on the masses ID often have a

273
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,180
hard time differentiating

274
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,219
between the ingredients that are
unacceptable strange or not we're home

275
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,480
maybe even the you want to warmer here

276
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,600
out there bureau things that are harmful
are you okay

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,330
suit you if you think about that for out
the reality is dad

278
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,180
so much Steve washing and many people in
this community

279
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,329
are people who live their lives in this
space

280
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,830
is outside was more more more socially
acceptable

281
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,630
but is hopeful of the inside will would
be all-inclusive

282
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,140
insider what is what is harmful or or
malicious

283
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,430
assume you when you leave why

284
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,649
been asked to use you have a great deal
to be

285
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:05,170
because a society does not do the job
telling the difference between

286
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,790
you and someone who's actually teams and
it may be a bar

00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,859
that community because under the new
perspective that comes from moving in

309
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,649
SAT

310
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,550
is able to see opportunities for
innovation and have a tremendous impact

311
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,850
on our on world okay our

312
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,429
our ability to do what we do you you how
are those two million

313
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,830
impact it has comes from its perspective
which is a perspective that

314
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,310
intense up on civil liberties forms

315
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,620
and and that's something that I don't
think

316
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,169
it so the reality is that the easily
bruised in

317
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,360
removed we see this stays between what
is legal

318
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,909
and what is socially so who will be
given to hollow's

319
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,310
buoyed by herself she is a decision
where our world is certainly Browns

320
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,520
a.m. weird you have something to hide

321
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,810
and back if our world is destroyed
there's a whole lot of value that

322
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,139
casually with there are a whole lot of
the got thrown out

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,450
that now more so

324
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,170
says Hyderabad we have had

325
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,610
a number a these happened

326
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,889
that have changed Hui bad

327
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,750
civil liberties function

a socially acceptable illegal

340
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,430
and malicious point out that there are
activities that

341
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,210

legal letter also socially acceptable

346
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,900

on inside his own pad

384
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,280
that that theory was gonna go to the
Supreme Court

385
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,290
I had the Bush administration wisely
decided not to have you must be more

386
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,800

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,760
enough tension and invited him on the
basis so that there was a piece of paper

391
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,129
that

392
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,510
inside it has your entire which you know

393
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,690

parent organization

404
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm so that anyway does not a problem
here is that this is a US citizen on US

405
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,679
soil we do you know Chargers

406
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,000
and energy sources are you supposed to
have charges

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,679
a when you see someone and it is little
hampered at six years later the image

408
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,429
returned to them

409
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,870
prime believes that the humor in six
years

I without arms down there be another
room don't know what are you most is as

411
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,049
far as I know was being without charges

412
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,350
obviously like they have decided not you
know generals halsey

413
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,870
buddy grisham somewhere disconcerting
precedent for the future

414
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:52,668
sir round without yeah if they decide to
rate I think the issue is

415
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:55,770
that's an excellent question what else

416
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,809
you will that I thought I would get
there so extortion

417
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,910
%uh show Mom Obama clearly

418
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,590
ran out of laps love I'm gonna change so
that things are happening around

419
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,570
right a I

420
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,129
yes you are you're all week a

421
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:20,270
hard and should ensure he argued that he
has stopped the passport forgery

422
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,980
he's she might about be I don't know
they have energy is the one place right

423
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,400
now so you need to you know

424
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,730
play better-known workers any

425
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,850
hopefully that issue has been resolved
process for your wireless zones is it

426
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,080
so he doesn't like you think the moment
why was your most part

427
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,679
you can argue there is a whole group of
people that a class action lawsuit about

428
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,790
this and they're all

429
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,340
yeah I'm I something's not right filing
this lawsuit if I was part of you know I

430
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,790
probably will you in the ass I

431
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,310
and a you know why I you the they're
gonna have to go through the whole

432
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,480
process in order to get an education

433
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,310
so we will you know the US government
has been prevented from traveling about

434
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,450
plus long yes a and that no fly list

435
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,850
is a filtering down into other areas
that he is

436
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,959
new jersey that recently passed a law
saying that you're on the no fly list

437
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,340
you can't believe I've got yeah
absolutely

438
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,879
yeah because you're due process free
black players the comedian at

439
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,780
is not a holler we don't know what is
your son so in the context effects for

440
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,010
lawyers what was the mall and getting
this

441
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,320
but who knows me on that one questions
process for removing

442
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,990
you noses this is different because the
resolves

443
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,990
creditors there doesn't appear to be
your process for removing

444
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,380
name I'm suspicion the searchers are
more trucks is borders II national

445
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,340
were in the back asap the don't let
anyone tell you that it's always been

446
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,909
that means it hasn't been that way

447
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,910
his first what will happen black years
ago and certainly

448
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,160
the so the amount of data people in your
room is completely different from

449
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,000
hard-working different from what the way
it was more and secondly the

450
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,830
the rules I have actually changed out
with a constitutional issue

451
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,889
obscene or not the rules have been
rather remarkable

452
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,169
us to ensure that you the who

453
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:14,769
causes Asian the hash physically destroy
things that you can bet you moan and

454
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,769
without suspicion would not be
reasonably you done anything wrong sir

455
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,080
your old guard that yesterday

456
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,529
yes that's right that's right gases

457
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,909
social rather than he where these trying
something

458
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:32,309
was with a friend so he had virtually
dinner inert gas

459
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,529
you can call its lead role in somehow
you

460
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:39,139
they they claim that they had no reason
to suspect the Spurs was responding

461
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,490
randomly decided to release their
masculine

462
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,070
lo and behold there was we dare I and so
will you be in a scene from

463
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,220
who the fuck knows better %uh you know
their argument was that we didn't really

464
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,010
was casting suspicion

465
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,110
and the Board held us and there are no
Muslim people

466
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,750
have gasoline and gas tank and even so
happen to

467
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,649
customs Asian saw your gasoline that
would not be a significant crimes the

468
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:05,739
Persians

469
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,059
really not that big a deal and I think
you down that I

470
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,200
exact that that conclusion but the
problem is that people have come to that

471
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,059
conclusion is being treated like a

472
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,570
they had up you know the gate is now
open for any harm destruction have any

473
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,010
visible property in congress across the
border

474
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,690
user could be no I'm consequence that
Madame ahead

475
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,789
that a rationalization i think is
extremely

476
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:33,100
dangerous but that is exactly what
people have had john has resulted in his

477
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,610
team

478
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:39,969
we're good to go us know yeah exactly
I'm really pleased indeed the

479
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,380
precedent that establish these issues
fine

480
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,710
but what more do you reading response
that presses

481
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,159
deeply troubling I'm a warrantless
wiretapping so he had this whole debate

482
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,990
about worms wiretapping

483
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,240
the Bush administration I don't come
back to in a minute

484
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,900
but on its own you know I i've %uh
problem solvers miss all the home number

485
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,910
you know million I'm and business
records surveillance

486
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,320
um you know we need that show printable
you dad everyone should be my home town

487
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,290
all over the world

488
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,220
New Years Eve a few years ago in Las
Vegas all other names and addresses

489
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,970
resent the FBI prosecutors be examples

490
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,800
services rendered collection that that
that have been publicly disclosed

491
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,370
I don't think anyone appreciated the

492
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,379
business record but in my view that so

493
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,570
the law says that they're allowed clash
records give those records are relevant

494
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,770
to an investigation

495
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,929
and modern interpretation around spoke
or was that

496
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,390
daddy business record actually had been
so my realm

497
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,020
done in the SEC tradition is dat

498
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,460
if the his record is therefore relevant
his own

499
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,870
they're not allowed to collect fees they
don't want to come okay bed

500
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,469
me want to collect is therefore relevant
in the can a

501
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,100
which is I'm you know a little bit
unreasonable but nonetheless is the

502
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,760
policy the property manager so

503
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,290
you brought up another morning would you
bring them then I'm

504
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,649
around a listener drug to me

505
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,299
feel Phil yeah Obama now 10-0

506
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:19,600
there's a very good policy I was the
Benjamin went to work for peace

507
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
situation and if he runs a blog called
long hair

508
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,520
and I will miss him later and

509
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,429
but on law fear gearan's a post about
the drone rationalization the

510
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:32,960
rationalization

511
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,539
yet did any their debt that he's more
eating places where they hear on the

512
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:39,330
beach

513
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,710
through other means and and

514
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,010
and there is a human interest that they
are going to attack humans

515
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,650
said best asses story %uh he's not

516
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,039
they have not argued that the drone
anybody wanna whatever

517
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,340
the heart you there's the specifics
those three bars I don't remember

518
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,059
one members who's been in contact with
which to you an entity you have to be in

519
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,840
the mountains of Afghanistan somewhere

520
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,970
and you have to be in it for the united
states here I'm

521
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,750
some other there's some other wrong and
and so

522
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,020
it there's not a lot advocacy about this
issue

523
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,260
I won't be more concerned about what
happened %uh but

524
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,779
you know the the actually or nationally
have her

525
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,299
you know you you its it's not it's time
the question is really whether

526
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,620
weather here definition things like in
minutes rather seems house

527
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,049
naturally where goods by sea day he
talked about how

528
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,250
beers good beer your changing the
definition

529
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,559
evidence there she said so you know what
we're doing is not being what it means

530
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,020
to you

531
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,450
where relevant does not mean what it
means to you use all these words be

532
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,850
using but it turns out when you delete
this your best

533
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,149
the definition with their function mom's
not definition that everyone understands

534
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,039
that

535
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,779
should be and dads at home double-speak
that is DB

536
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,760
troubling comes musicians as I'm all
agreed on a policy

537
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,029
but it back my mining machine we've
agreed was not seen as

538
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,590
everyone else is actually agreed to
susan graver why

539
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,090
you you miss the huge one about on

540
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,299
the secret interpretation of the the
Patriot Act

541
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,629
well that comes back to business records
remains

542
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,690
not exactly ok I am I love you

543
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,130
gananoque comparably solid growth in

544
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,190
hiney deals with individuals also so

545
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,310
juniors shoes

546
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,379
%uh consequences so for small actually
the morning of backline

547
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,010
I just wanna make the observation that
would be there are review ojeda

548
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,590
happened over the past two years I have
a significant impact on I'm

549
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,040
on civil liberties and so I talked about
how solutions

550
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,220
chaplain who pollutants page that allows
communities like this team's

551
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,010
you know I your brand you know I don't
threaten me because I know hey I feel

552
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,610
brand because I'm someone who stands
outside of what is

553
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,050
normal behavior and I i see the value
i've seen the value to your

554
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,970
the and I i think that that is why it's
communities sabes

555
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,800
it is you know the reality is that this
has consequences

556
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,659
the online good government's ability to
investigators and I don't think the

557
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,690
bedbugs absolutely appreciate

558
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,440
yeah whose consequences for that as well
as a reference

559
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,230
so so this is

560
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,960
ensure that so use this sky the
timelines

561
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,260
brothers 5e 30 you guys who this guy

562
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,190
forget his name is god's one statistic
seems really good sports because the

563
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,050
yeah summer wanna lose you gave us our
political

564
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,220
yeah this time since his forced
visitation

565
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,740
DD outcomes is sporting events and then
transfer back to college to be applied

566
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,990
it to you

567
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,030
politics any was

568
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,750
yet very accurate predictions for the
previous election us to use

569
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,980
W worst be reckoned with his house but
doesn't like him

570
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,490
because who is when he does is eat drink
and it doesn't

571
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,800
facility in their word it just sorta

572
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,879
like factual and so is so

573
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,190
we're for example in the previous
election

574
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,680
irrawaddy who desire the I you have this
this supposed

575
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,000
it has between Obama and I'm Romney

576
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,920
in fact like the the likely winner on
the winning the elections like

577
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,910
and the data show the house and that was
not something that you really like

578
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,910
because it didn't

579
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,940
it in creating controversy wasn't
contrast

580
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,240
it was like house done and so I'm

581
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,850
you know i i people don't like true I'm

582
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:43,270
show anyway yes right a show so he did
this post right after

583
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,840
that what's known in relation to this
post this chart is how people in the US

584
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,340
House

585
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,090
Buddha he's reacted squad you see
they're basically

586
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,370
work water rinse other people in the
house there establishment times that

587
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:57,639
much

588
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,100
congresspersons and and there are about
the rain congresspersons and it broke

589
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,469
down more allows

590
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,090
all the graces that those lines this is
this is what I'm getting

591
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,469
you get if you like so bad in the the
you know

592
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,689
5 six years ago when Bush was
wiretapping

593
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,940
more there is clear partisan the box
where

594
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,980
doing a little more up in arms about
whatever not good for their

595
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,409
their dinner delivery mileage and then
the republicans were 10

596
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,960
bother me any by terrorism you know the

597
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,179
you know you to run it was clear person
by

598
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,310
but how is Obama doing wiretapping

599
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,449
we have a completely different reaction
already is actually broken up into

600
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,529
quadrants

601
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,380
some you know the we still have the the
scene by someone haha Bush

602
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,820
are more likely to climb up there here
toons is dead

603
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,220
I you know proponents I'll see 3

604
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,350
to you have these these establishment
conservatives

605
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,890
apps that that supports released about
I'm sorry and then you have but you also

606
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,650
have an anti South Windsor

607
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,350
some these are people who supported bush
he was used by

608
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,910
but they're opposed to Obama who inspire
because they don't like Obama

609
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,069
because he's a liberal so YouTube you
you have this

610
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,300
other water to the Conservative Party
now that that's that's concerned about

611
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,920
30 stab someone soon

612

rather large cruise lines by he's on
their side to the first announcement

615
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,090
a establishment liberals a you know who

616
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,980
the DNC below seasonal you are arguing
that you know abortions

617
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,340
I was bad homicide is fine a and then
you and then you have

618
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,410
and I stuffed animals were opposed by a
man who knows

619
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,029
%uh and I'm you know they were they were
close by

620
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:58,150
more under whose time I'm there are the
fear not because you think I should be

621
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,820
you is that minute so to this is Ben the
way this is broken down

622
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,070
%uh and its is possible interesting a

623
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,080
you know are you missing me you the ER
his bday is down your dues are not that

624
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,799
interesting

625
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,840
you're looking for use I'm you remember
how good

626
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,300
government whatever a.m. the

627
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,950
arguments are the the establishment
after a little bit more interesting

628
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,480
because you have been hearing them

629
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,000
we're now hearing and the
rationalizations that Bush was doing was

630
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,630
legal

631
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,690
my Obama's to use lethal I

632
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,750
nothing could be further from the truth

633
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,770
what Obama is alleged to have done

634
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,090
is much more a untrue said anything that

635
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,020
was a letter about bush all bush was
president %uh sowwy

636
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,450
the me bush was president was about

637
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,129
I am visibility other a international
telecommunications between people

638
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,870
united's the gym known here are some
signs

639
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,770
and whether I want workers required that
has real some

640
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,320
it really was a technicality everyone
agrees that the essay should be almost

641
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,150
everyone agrees with the essay should be
spying on

642
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,570
three occasions between Americans and
more nude beach chairs

643
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,770
I understood you back the question is
whether or not the ball to process the

644
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,759
one who are you

645
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,940
and the whole process you want

646
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,060
like other additional cost for speaking
out that they don't

647
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,110
actually bachelor so that's a pretty
narrow debate

648
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,670
%uh one what Obama's stuff is firing on
all of you

649
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,150
and every single most United States all
it is an American citizens

650
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,740
that's that's a completely different
aides however the difference huh

651
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,839
much prior system and this is my is a
breaker

652
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,840
consortium eyes with your BS of this
hellhole

653
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,020
that that Bush was not getting warrants
for his

654
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,190
terms for males which RS you know for
five years no one ever was

655
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,550
you want to be pissed off that Obama is
fine everyone United States

656
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,880
furthermore the argument that Obama what
if I was to use the whole

657
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,410
is use is on is is highly possible that
I have business to

658
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,740
a people worried about the hot 'em

659
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,839
a wanna and yeah it should be reached me
when I see these people relate my

660
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,270
numbers

661
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,890
not breaking the law I'm so jim
sensenbrenner is the guy who wrote that

662
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,069
he'd react

663
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,599
I

664
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,069
as a you know that danger you know that

665
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:26,670
I offered to please react to this is
usually the law only by only

666
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,049
up for a class %uh the ACLU's lawsuit
over this issue

667
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:34,410
a couple weeks ago when he said that he
was not aware

668
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,519
video surveillance million reauthorize
the beach react 2011

669
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,689
anyway if he was aware that that you
would not have voted

670
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,210
numero use so you have congressman
arguing that was like you

671
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,960
he would not have voted for the
legislation devoted to you the truth

672
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,160
alright 'em soon so you know

673
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,339
put that in your pipe and smoke it a

674
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,869
I'm or inheritors a I

675
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,549
Bieber officers on the planet he's an
expert on fourth amendment %uh

676
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,759
rage eloquently about it all the time at
you know he said it was surprising

677
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:08,460
troubling you

678
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,569
the longest future in the way they are
very dreamy it has

679
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:14,960
you can criticize the way the government
dribbling

680
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,579
so I mention benjamin Wade us whom

681
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:23,839
who supports the drone program okay so
certainly not a left-wing liberal

682
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,049
benjamin Wade says it is really
different records companies don't for

683
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:28,749
many

684
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:32,189
he had bought one long message should be
really nice

685
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,469
qualified we've saved but the legal
alright

686
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:39,049
ahead again you know not a left-wing
liberals say

687
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:43,029
something like that answer to this guy
is is a and certainly AM

688
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:46,259
Highland Mall expert on national
security policy

689
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,500
Air Force so you know General Greg and
and

690
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,670
Christopher us burden our you know
jeffrey Brown and worse yet Basu no

691
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,630
upside down

692
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,839
right so you use condoms if you want but
the

693
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,990
the I have been very clear that you know

694
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,560
%uh statute expressly authorized
management your opinion is that Obama

695
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,700
did not break the law

696
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,540
there's a lot of very smart move across
the political spectrum not really bad

697
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,859
and the owner long nap was there Russian

698
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:16,799
did you or your across the the

699
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,220
her hardware views way how you
government

700
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,240
baller outlaw no because I don't know
what that is

701
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,799
I'm so yeah artwork

702
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,720
yeah the other side at this point and
that is kinda frustrating museum nice

703
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,189
out

704
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,220
lab that is %uh dead I absolutely no
signs point is

705
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,859
so clearly used services injury on here
that the government was to you should be

706
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:42,299
doing

707
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,070
bad but people want to have as they are
to be not about the government did but

708
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,060
bounced noted

709
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,390
and I I actually don't give a fuck about
you did because I didn't vote for him in

710
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,348
a non-controlled

711
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,040
actions it doesn't really matter I share
with the government did

712
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,589
because that's the institution that were
you know all inherently Aparna

713
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:03,890
a you know if stone intercut be an
asshole

714
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:09,480
doesn't really matter the but everyone
is concerned over the size euro workroom

715
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,599
in and I don't think ago alright

716
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,089
why I don't think in some no I think
future

717
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:20,450
there's a reasonable I your disposal do
you think we should just loves

718
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,790
so consumers programmable the rumors
program is exactly what you would expect

719
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,680
that if you understood

720
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,290
policy gas they're going to be slow in
getting the

721
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,460
Facebook Council people worse suspected
terrorists and you'd expect people to be

722
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,109
collaborating with them

723
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,529
as and the problem is that the chart
shows

724
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,810
which social networking sites they have
strong connections with so

725
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,960
10 wage working hard with our schedules

726
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,280
%um you can choose to use the Site
injuries there there was a whole

727
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,750
guard I so well

728
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,030
yeah proceedings going so I'm

729
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,359
be home for the house of cards are the
essential to my house ones

730
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,950
injured yeah

731
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:09,129
places on earth hey ho guard

732
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,670
okay you will hold may have gone I just
be sarcastic

733
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,230
eso me so that 'em

734
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,380
so I mean I didn't believe her cherished
you should i use facebook gives you some

735
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,300
little something ever decided to drop
well as an affirmation is useful to

736
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,040
those people

737
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,470
so who really likes using yahoo users

738
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,740
so it is indisputable verbally have
reasonable

739
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,118
same time his blues seems that the
government is really should be doing

740
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,640
measure you will be hungry
government-backed it is possible to both

741
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,470
what he had was organising

742
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,109
I am I would be more more think it
matters that much

743
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:49,880
you'll be black or white must good or
bad ahead

744
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,750
you know the people who know I a you
know comprehend the idea that would be a

745
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,170
complicated name to users both human and
Noble

746
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,480

747

754
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,519
at work still is so there's two problems
that occur and actual you haven't

755
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,828
one is that all conspiracy theories are
now room

756
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:44,059
okay yeah

757
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,749

numbers of people were like you values
used by everybody why are you acting as

760
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,150
a surprise

761
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,829
is because under the in good company
when did not admit such things

762

okay %uh previously there a hundred
people let's discuss some was going on

763
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,788
there a lot of people who believe that
it's true that nobody had any

764
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:14,039
through is open proper company what did
not admit that some things were going on

765

1035
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:39,029
the data from these principles are were
not be that we have institutions

1036

you very much um

1046
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,558
it is these are being very important
values are means court has to be class

1047
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,400
aligncenter

1048
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,549
researchers a smaller and it is huge

1049
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:26,589
10 material about the actual received
important

1050
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:30,190
on cubans bones were not at home so

1051
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:33,480
anyone tells you this hasn't had a
consequence from a legal standpoint here

1052
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,109
bored

1053
01:01:34,109 --> 01:01:38,788
and has had a huge consequences it has
made the process more transparent

1054
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:41,690
it has allowed us to have more
visibility I don't know officially

1055
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,339
changed

1056
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:47,349
what's happening but at least I am you
know you're no longer have importance is

1057
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,769
the

1058
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:51,390
miss the arguments that are being made
on the basis that the back then secretly

1059
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:51,940
been

1060
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,810
showed me

1061
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:58,480
as a consequence all this stuff coming
out we'll resume way

1062
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,850
where we are where we actually have a
sit down somewhere

1063
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:06,120
the Supreme Court decided this was not
the whole and and we get there then

1064
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,580
that will that will be apartments down a

1065
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:13,170
you know injury to be seen at his

people who were basically like

damage your eyes to bring to your house
is

1087
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,620
blue purple halls were among the one
because

1088
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,299
all there to use isn't the only reason
and

1089
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:51,100
day Soleil so where does black he you
had as we broke even but my office is

1090
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,210

1091
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:55,339
harding's remembers you got fucked up
okay

1092
01:03:55,339 --> 01:03:59,700

fucking try to me she said

1093
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,390
Friday because you know yeah they were
bringing in all these foreign powers and

1094
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:07,950
miss the night before a beginner
opposing political parties offices

1095
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:11,060
so so that's what happened n in the

1096
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,920
the the sunny included so do things
happen personally has been more relieved

1097
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,089
than sad that

1098
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:21,480
intelligence activity that is pretty
happy people that are

1099
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,820
wall your or how we're going to your
supply that works for me try to use that

1100
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,070
I conspiring with al

1101
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:31,570
warrant that it or American I cannot I
have you want is fine

1102
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:36,250
you nearby do you for national security
reasons so naturally from 1972

1103
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:40,690
in the house three months I found a guy
who's a professor at the more college

1104
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:41,650
are you remove that

1105
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,240
jewelry mercy wrong and is the hair come
with everything

1106
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,990
and that you know our our systems
require more effort I don't think your

1107
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,390
internet Americans

1108
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:54,069
there are there are people who really
are Adrian there should be more

1109
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,750
requires the whole g0 really hard

1110
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,770
there there is a fashionably so a

1111
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:05,550
you don't understand I'm a life support
was basically is the congress saying

1112
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,220
okay the Constitution

1113
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,930
allows the CIA perspire I'm foreign
powers that we want to create

1114
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:16,609
a process that way because I was the one
who borrowed so that's one bad

1115
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:20,630
that's what the buzz is what is there to
do you think so Constitution

1116
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:25,180
so square when with with bush was
charged with spying humility

1117
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,560
there was argument that was
constitutional but legal

1118
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,160
soon constitutional idea is that is the
constitutional

1119
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,710
for evidence

1120
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,010
arrangements polluters law that requires
you to get to work my

1121
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,180
word be brutal long soon legal

1122
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,490
did it was constitutional so so the

1123
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,589
I Ormsby each from really in the home
page

1124
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:51,470
and require that the Longhorns Stadium
this is what we're doing slam during in

1125
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:55,250

1128
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:03,690
stuff that's going on holiday

1129
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:08,020
is an but the problem is that clearly in
their little secret chamber where no one

1130
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,660
goes to review what they're saying

1131
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,220
the related to the point where
relinquish losing

1132

1137
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:34,500

1146
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:05,849
in tone as usual would be a positive
thing and maybe

1147

we are not a yeah I i so

1166
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,500
I I fears in the top part

1167
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,120
II so I used the word resilience

1168
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,189
as my job and I did that pretty well you
know

1169
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:29,450
21 contact I corporate surveillance I

1170
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:33,609
didn't you the fancy who %uh will not be
human

1171
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,799
um though I want to have anything one
room here the more mature and I want to

1172
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,950
do well I wondered why I wanted to

1173
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,660
I I wanted to talk about like the mind
set up surveillance

1174
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:47,029
as there are some arguments I'll

1175
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:52,689
or I'll a blase attitude in the bases
around I don't think anyone here in this

1176
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:53,410
remake

1177
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:57,630
think a lot of people have encountered a
bird ample the

1178
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:01,450
on might oh why we didn't why would
anybody espy

1179
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,729
on he has my life is really boring and

1180
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:07,899
so my experience is doing surveillance
are in that

1181
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:12,399
there are people I'm really enjoyed
watching

1182
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,479
your the wine and they're just people
who he

1183
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,490
who is really yes the mom like why I'm

1184
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,889
private life private I'm many people
like that

1185
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,490
and I also in her track in their
profession

1186
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:31,300
right and so when you surveillance is
really easy to

1187
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,040
not do anything you have a job doing
surveillance

1188
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,250
you can you buy me nothing and say well
I didn't see anything interesting

1189
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:43,640
anything you that all players are yeah
you that for a long time

1190
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,330
and so the people that work doing
surveillance I'll will

1191
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:51,279
other than will made %uh things the bomb

1192
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,130
they will their jobs are so worried then
they will

1193
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:59,450
they they will come up with a story on
or and applied them to the beings they

1194
01:09:59,450 --> 01:09:59,920
see

1195
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,700
because your life is so boring and so
that way if they're

1196
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,920
if they're wrong on Beijing goes into

1197
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,330
their boss and well-known if they're
right they can be.

1198
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:13,330
The Hangover their box in dade look what
I found wilhelm

1199
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:17,650
village and I am look how good I am in
surveillance and impress their house

1200
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:18,679
supervisor

1201
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,910
with their diligence doing surveillance
and if they're wrong they can say

1202
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:27,070
well I was wrong but at least I
documented in the logs and I didn't you

1203
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,870
I any I didn't do anything against our
policy and legal

1204
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:34,300
and maybe they find something else line

1205
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,110
something that and then getting somebody
fired out which I saw were if it doesn't

1206
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,540
get somebody fired he ends up becoming
gossip within this around

1207
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,930
Marvin and negatively impact people's
careers

1208
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:49,620
he has that gaza end up going to you

1209
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,660
the leadership in the company and

1210
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:57,710
merson question never find out that they
are being Gaza

1211
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:01,110
about days on surveillance about them

1212
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:04,559
and so on and so

1213
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,000
so I just wanted to point out

1214
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,320
that I you know when

1215
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,910
when when the bombing comes out you know
it yeah like about

1216
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:16,480
the

1217
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,230
the 2000 use only Olympics someone said

1218
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:25,089
%uh oh that must be so hard looking for
all those text messages well no because

1219
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:28,550
there are people that are super
interested in this text messages

1220
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,180
and come up with stories about why this
text messages are increasing

1221
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:38,070
and so you don't get to decide her story
is the you do your mark so I'd be dead

1222
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,160
a huge thing that people need to
contemplate is

1223
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,820
the self-perpetuating major the stage
where

1224
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,110
if your job is to be used for you one
guy I'm that you have to justify

1225
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:53,769
the cost that you have to this is done
by finding these better

1226
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:58,370
interest at rationalizing the idea of
its beginning what it is that you do

1227
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:02,760
up just as so you know in in the
commercial marketplace be more trying to

1228
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,180
to 10 you build there there

1229
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,560
there there companies grow with you
doing you know people he's using to be a

1230
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,040
crime

1231
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,570
right while so

1232
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,990
resumes you you

1233
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:19,070
you know each one you know find these
just

1234
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:22,170
by X that has been ACA

1235
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,460
a movie and I'm seeing this is an
argument that was made by

1236
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,740
a solar reporters at the new york times
your

1237
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:32,019
trappings taking over the past decade
that you know

1238
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:35,850
believe there's a lot of different ways
terrorism this is the one

1239
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,180
really know how to do well a.m. we we
understand how to do a movie

1240
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:44,120
Kristin M by then and a usually there
were three

1241
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,230
articulated congress them we do it

1242
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:51,019
so that's that's what we're gonna
getting any surveillance because they're

1243
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,540
were gonna I'm and and there are there
any other things that were

1244
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,870
an honest man at that would be impacted
as well them when I'm guessing

1245
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:03,440
message shop people that are out there

1246
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,860
I'm on am

1247
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,950
yeah yeah I what's the exit you're
getting Shaikh says

1248
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:15,019
tell you to mention NY

1249
01:13:15,019 --> 01:13:18,359
rights or okay lost an extra might be

1250
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:21,949
yep rights that were we have to do with
your

1251
01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:25,169
soon unity on the Internet so that you
could

1252
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:28,648
participate in discussions online
without necessarily having your true

1253
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:29,939
name associated with those

1254
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:33,139
looms the incident me so

1255
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:38,139
everyone know who you talkin strap

1256
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:44,260
only he did he stated so so I worry that
this conference so I have and

1257
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,389
many human genius I have right now %um

1258
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,679
so it turns out that some would be used
to bring know that your corner to the

1259
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:54,849
to the class and other people praying
part because initially the professor

1260
01:13:54,849 --> 01:13:55,409
Raymond

1261
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:59,058
second-year players with class and the
guy shows up in every

1262
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:02,619
there's no few million readers daily
players do important

1263
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:05,669
and so with the stage now presenting
remotely

1264
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:10,279
I you know I i fear that that eventually
this will be a commercial

1265
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:14,519
conference a

1266
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:17,190
him refunds

1267
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:20,169
where Israel my yeah

1268
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:25,140
that should be the slogan for free yeah

1269
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,570

1270
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:32,120

1290
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:46,470
yeah we'll all be worth it you know you

his three goals I are you freaking out
about it you know it is your major

1302
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:31,250
partisanship about people with you or
for the actual argument well washed it

1303
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,900
the reality is that because the people
involved in this topic the people that

1304
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,179
were in montana before

01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,630
partisanship weekend winner

1309

people make that argument I haven't done
anything wrong I don't have anything can

1310
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:58,440

will be invaluable in bad mood and the

1318
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,390
reno partisanship you know what you
doing

1319
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:33,250
you back to your birthday is normal

1320
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,260
and his legal establishes

1321
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:40,260
but it's working in somebody else's in
the

1322
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,790
partisanship yeah then all of a sudden

1323
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:47,430
you were buying 100 s another dozen
other line

1324
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:51,179
him yes you know you

1325
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:57,060
yeah yeah Street like humorous

1326
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,290
right

1327
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:03,830
as

1328
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,780
wannabes service

1329
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,750
shows no I am people's bigger

1330
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,780
me I make I'll have anything I get word
out

1331
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,009
by a talk about but never

1332
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:19,480
waters mind talking about you ago you
know

1333
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:23,169
now we know that %um by now who home

1334
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:27,670
rights abuses this is so let me talk
about

1335
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:31,150
talk about that permitted us via there's
actually like it monogram

1336
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:34,700
to the operation Spain and that is so um

1337
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,030
there's this whole or the minute
discussion about whether

1338
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,370
you know this is so my guess is the word
to Big Bird prohibits unreasonable

1339
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:41,970
searches

1340
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:45,560
so we have to decide whether or not we
think this is reasonable or unreasonable

1341
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,540
and an S O you know there's a lot of why

1342
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:53,250
there's a wide variety of different
values thank you debut

1343
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,330
that could come under the banner when
using the word reasonable or

1344
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:57,120
unreasonable

1345
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,300
these up show solution but there's
another aspect to this which is the

1346
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,380
first amendment issue

1347
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:06,020
which is that the first amendment 0

1348
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:10,470
projects your right to real Association
and so

1349
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:13,540
what is admittedly database is helpful
calls

1350
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,900
actually yes is not really your is
flashing

1351
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,170
is your associations you're
communicating with

1352
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:24,449
is with questions is here

1353
01:19:24,449 --> 01:19:28,239
can you have a situation where it's
possible for the government to hold you

1354
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:28,759
give me some

1355
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,090
every person associated with but you
simultaneously him

1356
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:37,270
freedom Association is possible to
conceive that but is

1357
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:40,489
is is it's a little is who really

1358
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,889
I'm online intrudes on a truism

1359
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:48,610
a what you can accept the generally
speaking with respect to the First

1360
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:49,269
Amendment

1361
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:52,580
we discuss and chilling where you know

1362
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,830
if you people are afraid to speak their
minds or

1363
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:59,809
you know if i if i dont wanna go on to
bring didn't seem ideal because I think

1364
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,210
they're gonna be consequences about the
National

1365
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:05,380
problem regime into you give them said

1366
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:09,900
I'm gonna say I'm not prohibited from
actually doing now if I'm afraid to

1367
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,849
speak my mind the whole process breaks
down because I here

1368
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:16,640
I have to be allowed to view long as a
bottom line are you allowed to come here

1369
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,890
to see some shit then

1370
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:22,429
later on I might be having a possible
should I was wrong euros AM I can't do

1371
01:20:22,429 --> 01:20:23,030
that

1372
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:26,320
in my home graders say something that I
later rebranded

1373
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,679
yeah you know because people are gonna
concrete house was for me

1374
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,160
worry if I'm afraid to say something
that is true and I don't regret but

1375
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,849
know you know because people are gonna
free house was from a nap there

1376
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:40,199
that limits our ability to have these
conversations and so

1377
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:44,059
I heard about it this way play you know
must say dat

1378
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:47,250
you know you decide to associate with
someone who's involved in a political

1379
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,070
issue

1380
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:51,309
because you you know I agree with that
but then later

1381
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:55,500
usually go on misleading farm income
radicalized be given some

1382
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,370
crime

1383
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,599
um you know now you're associated with
that because you call that you talk to

1384
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,900
them is in the database

1385
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,059
something ominous I started asking that
because

1386
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:09,300
they became radicalized do something
crazy you're gonna come up with your day

1387
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,630
it so now you gotta be I'm not only you
know is it okay for me to talk to that

1388
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:13,950
person

1389
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,989
now because we aren't day you have been

1390
01:21:16,989 --> 01:21:20,889
five years from now is absolutely
something she and and you are really

1391
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:24,290
want to be associated to her since five
years from now they do something stupid

1392
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:27,719
you might decide some surgery might
decide I'm not gonna

1393
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:31,290
on their contract that you because I
don't know where were his me go

1394
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:34,750
you know I'm saying and add that that
has a negative impact

1395
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:39,050
on your freedom of association wonder
some sense for years is usually more

1396
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,540
because you're concerned about the
consequences that can happen for

1397
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,780
something happens in the future

1398
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:46,679
and I V that to me is busy

1399
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,070
you are constitutional issue we have

1400
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:53,280
the conserve the Medina records
retention

1401
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,120
yeah the fourth amendment I think that
there's a lot of people who have decided

1402
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,780
that

1403
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,130
the medina is not fun its own number the
other reasonable

1404
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:04,810
privacy expectations %um and peace out
there are diminished I'm

1405
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:08,440
I don't necessarily something I would
you believe we do that doesn't that

1406
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,650
doesn't eliminate this

1407
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,150
more first amendment concerns which is
that I ought to be able to talk to

1408
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,080
whoever I want to you and I hope not

1409
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,820
don't have to be breathing so they'd
bring that up his

1410
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,429
is a pretty big issues actually a lot
attempt to Anderson whose

1411
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:25,810
that usually usually kid now there's
there's a there's a

1412
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:30,760
there's no core I hope one other so the
usual he was a lawsuit for the volume

1413
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:34,300
write a review for our because they made
me that first man arguments about

1414
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,440
good um considered by the court system

1415
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,690
through the process so it'll be
interesting to see how

1416
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,820
now one-to-one my

1417
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:46,670
was up you mentioned you know I G

1418
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:51,850
flattening you we testified he said not
willingly

1419
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:55,230
we should go merger very much so im

1420
01:22:55,230 --> 01:23:00,839
five years ago senator prosecute him you
know the 100 we have it would like we

1421
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,540
understand

1422
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,630
no problem sorry to bother you me how
could we

1423
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:07,630
on our elected leaders that they don't

1424
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,910
be there in bed with their own accord in
his new account

1425
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,250
a me most are elected leaders are so mr.

1426
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:20,780
and the masses %uh question is how much
better than they have on XYZ elected

1427
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,650
leader in the design

1428
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:25,799
which is another's a serious concern I i
you know

1429
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,240
alright I guess is is everything up
there

1430
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,809
you know we love formulated you know
we're we're doing what we want a better

1431
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,280
life

1432
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,420
no Kid Hungry no problems or bother you

1433
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:43,590
another problem lying then re I didn't
get my collaborative you break already

1434
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:45,970
in a bad situation it doesn't matter

1435
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:50,400
you clearly committed perjury infirmary
where the country's varied as the mall

1436
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,639
we hear about to log you out the other
the judge made a decision that

1437
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,910
in order to stop motorists the end dad
I'm

1438
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:01,590
I'm very concerned about the idea that
we're just prosecutor that

1439
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:04,810
cuz alright and that's what we do
there's no homo

1440
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:07,909
when you reach your hardware is OK the
charges

1441
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:11,049
you know why congress and Ashley my
landlord

1442
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:14,340
is OK the white ones and Ed Martelle

1443
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,969
what they do use action I understand
yeah this is due to hold

1444
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:21,310
yeah you know i mean the reality is that
dead that

1445
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:24,320
they have you believe are popping up
everywhere he went

1446
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,880
but you know the this going to do whole
challenge

1447
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,510
and decided not we're not going to hold
the rule of thumb the red button his

1448
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,110
shirt match

1449
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:36,799
to go back to the topic what he was
talking about the freemen position

1450
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,739
you bring that into the real world not
doing one of their dog your mom's

1451
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:44,388
and so you might associate with someone
that person so she was someone else you

1452
01:24:44,389 --> 01:24:45,699
don't know this other person

1453
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:49,750
adventure but what errors and now you're
your dragged and yeah

1454
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:54,090
journey three degrees of separation I
guess is how it's partly sunny with no

1455
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:57,960
way to tell which is absolutely confirm
you're all agree for me

1456
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,290
as you're ok your worst nightmare yeah
um

1457
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:05,119
yeah I'm talking to self censorship in
here you should not issue

1458
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:06,339
when shelter

1459
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:09,370
is excellent website until next time
we're guessing yeah

1460
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:13,480
that's a good has a lot of good stories
about us he doesn't

1461
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,660
meant end-users pass a fertile

1462
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:20,750
maybe believe of value yeah

1463
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:26,340
their intrinsic to hear about got my
name is also on that website

1464
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:29,850
I'm who a certain

1465
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:32,960
electronics manufacturer was receiving
any nicer

1466
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,050
on so who in

1467
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:41,660
around disease when no SS the Iowa
something started they found no

1468
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,480
day Indonesia they did gated the whole
culture

1469
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,089
as far as the political leaders going
mom

1470
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:52,490
on based on line and based on yeah

1471
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:56,130
having all the secrets the fifth and the
horses I would have

1472
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:59,030
say school document that way

1473
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:03,880
terminate the other he politician
history millionaires

1474
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,280
based on on dark secret the stranger

1475
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,550
tense and it seems like what happened
lately

1476
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:14,370
that our homes ID's routed internally

1477
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:18,019
individual this day we can do that you

1478
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,820
based on storing all your data in in
deadly

1479
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:26,500
future on but another thing i think is
very important i wanna talk about the

1480
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,460
Constitution talking about all this is
done his chores

1481
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,460
you know belongs to you government

1482
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:38,990
self-governing man is that the the
Bermuda Constitution resides within the

1483
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:39,700
ball

1484
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:44,340
and B it's very unclear that they don't
there's not even already

1485
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,680
including an eighty is the home that
ruth has

1486
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:52,500
everybody in the military and read that
doesn't come from humble beginnings

1487
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,960
government that an already you have that
maybe

1488
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:01,430
in hand according to going up nearly you
know the exact just my hand

1489
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,850
what we believe is right I'm and I get
100

1490
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,389
not working it out in the back 30

1491
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:12,030
we're still empowered we're gonna
someone who hasn't answered you

1492
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:15,400
that because that is clearly gone Rome

1493
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,949
in is clearly going in a direction that
into %um

1494
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:22,489
isn't just so soldiers the idea

1495
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:27,150
guys promoted by certain people that
that is the ideal unitary

1496
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:30,440
secular the idea that the executive
branch

1497
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:34,480
and then there is some truth in the back
these are you brave he's being moody

1498
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,879
intelligent newsworthiness that's ghetto
and

1499
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,389
baby a certain amount wanna be
independence with respect to decision

1500
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:42,960
making important

1501
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,349
I like to be the weaknesses in the
church's balances in a pinch right to

1502
01:27:47,349 --> 01:27:48,420
left something here

1503
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,889
believe the other side the point is the
argument that in order to be impacting

1504
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:52,829
the execu-

1505
01:27:52,829 --> 01:27:57,579
be world's independent respect this
year's things although that might be

1506
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:00,780
line he execuse constrained by you

1507
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,079
you jackie was genuinely novel

1508
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:07,449
all them to the right people I use was
back to where we started

1509
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:11,739
which is the concern bad then our
political system has become so

1510
01:28:11,739 --> 01:28:14,438
dominated by the

1511
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:18,050
the the finance here he is

1512
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:22,849
%uh dad and we don't really have here
last chance for you learning objectives

1513
01:28:22,849 --> 01:28:23,999
choices about Lee wanta

1514
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:27,570
office we have a situation where people
were well funded have the

1515
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,329
ways to reach the people and people or
not opener not able to

1516
01:28:31,329 --> 01:28:34,380
I be and so as a consequence

1517
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,289
you know the people that are getting
elected or not really be chosen by the

1518
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:39,159
people there he chose my partner's

1519
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:42,188
if that is the case with minors are
really didn't roll

1520
01:28:42,189 --> 01:28:46,510
its own and so again this is exactly you
supposed to be beholden to the most

1521
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:47,059
awful

1522
01:28:47,059 --> 01:28:50,590
people he's beholden to these to these
used honors

1523
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:54,159
Thessaly spotters are really the ones
were deciding what is means I sent the

1524
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:57,909
one from intelligence simply they're the
ones with grease consequences if they

1525
01:28:57,909 --> 01:28:58,860
decide that

1526
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:03,130
that is that the the the executive has
gone too far

1527
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,579
try I might be more willing to
countenance a certain amount of

1528
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:08,209
Independence please thank you

1529
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:11,320
back to Intel's Core and I'm really it's
very important

1530
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,999
but but but my concern is that we we
simultaneously

1531
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:19,329
all this debate about about civil
liberties and hold electric isn't a

1532
01:29:19,329 --> 01:29:22,090
problem that we have here is not
entirely clear

1533
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,019
the blue

1534
01:29:23,019 --> 01:29:27,799
leadership have visited fall is the
people and that and that problem is

1535
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:30,999
is really important and that's where
less are you talking about reach

1536
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:31,629
trackers

1537
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:35,119
he's really good that is really a
horrible Italy

1538
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,478
all the political system generally
horizontal your

1539
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,489
that perhaps moody comparable with that
would be

1540
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:45,539
do that is with me right and what i'm
saying is that we don't have the answer

1541
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:46,978
to that said

1542
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:51,029
is good what

1543
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:54,299
what I'm sayin yeah

1544
01:29:54,299 --> 01:29:57,539
the that no I'm beholden to the people

1545
01:29:57,539 --> 01:30:01,529
the people we are beholden to ourselves
%um then yeah

1546
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:05,329
is or is that like that that's something
in her world

1547
01:30:05,329 --> 01:30:08,478
and I didn't find the hearing he players

1548
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:12,229
being Lindsey Graham John McCain Obama
and Hillary

1549
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:16,760
whoever you want to get their life to
that we the entire world

1550
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,469
that environment here and it's not about
the individual people that are out here

1551
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:22,609
being forced to

1552
01:30:22,609 --> 01:30:25,679
you know the divide and conquer

1553
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,630
we're we have our own leaders in my

1554
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:31,870
we're gonna absolutely show you

1555
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:37,550
a lot OVA 42 way go out here right

1556
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:41,080
I hope they are willing to the house
important to you with respect to this I

1557
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,390
hope that people are not

1558
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:46,960
I don't think people understand that
then there's been a virgin pollution has

1559
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,810
been shut down their brother they're
willing to say that I don't want to be

1560

lied to you by these people the day that

1561
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,390
I hope that people say that they want to
be in charge and I it remains to be seen

1562
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:59,590
with an ace over again is a is probably

1563
