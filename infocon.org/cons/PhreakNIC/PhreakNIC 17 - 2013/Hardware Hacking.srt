1
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:05,779
remain your

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:09,059
I am going over and my him

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,219
her and might think okay iraq in the cup
soldering iron

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,580
article isn't for the program his
all-star

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,759
and process all starts out with idea

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,400
got are there doesn't get this cuz
hardware

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,609
doesn't use thing I want to do like them
their yard

8
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,390
from there you gotta go for you percent
in the air

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,650
are going to hack around words the

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,699
by some happened designer Ron

11
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:43,220
sign everything else round bad billet

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,280
your function real network the whole
process

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,299
realize it doesn't work written girls
all over again

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,580
and eventually get work numbers that the
idea burst that with the idea

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,089
a model and I have no clue what about
you that were created

16
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,170
up that you know like art creativity
really gets the whole

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,890
while me them

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,310
so you know about rumors and your so you
go about reverse engineering

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,590
here are few things to help you figure
out where

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,590
is more first thing is my

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,000
out there just about anything out my
he's

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
it might be invited usually if I i one

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm usually get some idea of what are
circuits them

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,790
the up from that billion

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,880
ways around it or get all mad about
grazing on board to get all

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Lok pasa are not around resistors you
might run

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,460
oliver's I'll knowing how the hell are
you I'll

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,000
values are the only way servicemen one

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,659
night surface mount ones are done with
numbers you know

30
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,600
very well generally known our where you
knowing how

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,649
learn other God

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,690
very and point maybe we're am

33
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,390
are trying to work through you know
parts are what they mean

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,070
you start lookin at work signal you
gotta mopping up

35
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,190
rules you guys monetary bolted

36
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,560
players Iran resistance

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,870
things even more useful

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,890
even more useful missiles good

39
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,670
down pretty expensive their lot up

40
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,299
but there are lotsa get up

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,380
with low-paying about a hundred bucks I
mean he was then we can start cooking

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,840
and

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,320
exactly what signals are your wall
runnin

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,410
very very home your

45
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,579
all 30 all with GPIO might be

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,970
like that

47
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,410
and then the next step years

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,209
I can go on for about five years you

49
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,689
line Marion or but eventually you come
up with their

50
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,700
but eventually you have a blizzard that
you think

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,260
that all annex that willing

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,409
other all the modern I last saw
tournament

53
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,890
when you but going after what's that
work

54
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,089
going for another night what makes
ironing good is that

55
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,400
you up XO you out re ok

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,579
banded soldering iron its hard

57
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,829
plugin minutes later it's finally hot
your

58
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,069
would you gonna clean it up on this
month

59
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,290
Libya suck all the way to the mind

60
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,260
wait another five minutes hear about

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,489
sell something like this morning about
100 when it gets

62
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,319
his attempt for perot God and it'll run

63
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,069
Oblast orgasm happen here all I'd

64
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:00,970
result I have a work blockbuster like

65
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,970
he I we had in the techniques

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,770
a we had and for you this is my

67
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,130
yes we wires and

68
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,660
they're all wires Norway they're always
Blue Heelers

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,680
whatever always a reason use

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,750
always beware I I'm

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,990
that's usually about that nice usually
about

72
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,030
their kids wired back on an icy

73
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,380
goes back to the good old days work for
you to wire wrap

74
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,010
rota war he said you can't do that
anymore

75
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,170
his get not have circuit boards wired
you

76
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,180
now or for the wires valuable for

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,560
dispel the on its on our

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,880
yes small re-hired back

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,700
while right on lag really step getting
backdoor

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,020
the its own forcing and

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,919
date and all journalist and lace moment

82
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,349
higher all on the floor and a four-month
wires all other aboard

83
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,789
and hopefully stop everything back in
the case

84
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,659
did me

85
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,580
it down wire are thing

86
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,770
are after its all done was involved on

87
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,139
once it's all done you back your back

88
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,789
into the same time is your user flavors
and near the product birthplace

89
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,659
your your on you know how you think
you're hot you're selling

90
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,490
dinner at probably not going to work her
improving

91
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,050
so your into problems you're not what
the hell you to run back to

92
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,479
fixing the going back into the fixing

93
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,969
hopefully yeah and hopefully your

94
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,430
as an office or something started out as
an office all your

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,919
large really didn't do a final crazy
idea

96
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,669
we line isn't crazy idea what you think
I should be able to go

97
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,990
other and I got it back together thing

98
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,180
that does something really awesome up

99
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,700
to I don't have any questions

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,240
comments

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
I have questions would

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,760
with types the project worked on writers

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,719
another example a work as a good example

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,600
ever work we've got the waiter yes

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,060
poet William yell a way UAVs

106
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,280
heavy play want so

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,289
like you process II I'll

108
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,730
at In N you can build process so

109
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,950
processes way the HOMO at

110
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,200
lady Danville good replace that ongoing

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,650
their heating element that apartment

112
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,280
at all and ultimately interface it all
back you

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,559
really runners you

114
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,129
you on

115
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,509
and example mind here

116
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,509
now you that your totally different

117
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,799
were grip

118
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:25,799
I work with the CNC at equipment

119
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,129
I guess another thing really I guess
another

120
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,210
evening really makes this all yep

121
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,299
is yep column

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,840
what makes us all I your there

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,359
there's so many different broke their

124
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,379
out there him you know you know you

125
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,550
and hardware if your gonna long jackets
and hardware

126
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,900
I no longer up design a circuit board

127
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,878
like units lacking a liar

128
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,780
like a wire whatever else here

129
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,219
has become a lot easier I think that's
wise a lot more problem

130
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,129
yes that

131
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,199
one you would

132
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,570
usually those who dis

133
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,080
arrived games

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,728
are good

135
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,969
mc1 way

136
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,459
him special or length

137
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,119
we could your

138
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,320
in

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,480
there

140
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,630
what

141
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:59,630
for one location

142
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,550
right now

143
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,358
with

144
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,680
then

145
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,120
well progress well

146
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,550
here as an urban having our

147
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,670
up or iraq

148
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,560
IP lookup where Neglia that usually

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
and load say look

150
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,349
what for larger yield we'll start with
lard

151
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,779
way down less here yes me

152
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,459
all its you many boy around might have
my god

153
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,829
hands got my dollar base where 9

154
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,920
process our as my by and

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,329
online are based on are numbered

156
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,050
mine dated handle without

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,859
certain the power said

158
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,060
10 based on what

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,229
at based on what you want and

160
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,240
yes and I'll have another X I'll

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,560
said of

162
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,479
more than really began their I get the
serial

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,310
run like dollars yep

164
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,099
other said ride serial ass and did

165
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,040
hands you now know what

166
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,329

172
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,070
nothing up on every argument about

173
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,240
soldering iron hall

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
were also makes

175
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,329

all up now that was all set up

203
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,680
now got this dollars on I see with a
circuit board will like it

204
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,949
thank God like getting they'll send you
that

205

and around outed program this

218
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,170
you know the code existing library
roller that

219

the source code as has with

234
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,310
all the logic Ron higher his life

235
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,689

16 did higher our

237
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,339
you read on higher parallel park all

238
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,880
once who's going yet and

239
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,399

yeah any

243
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,279
data bus board

244
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,210
out

245
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,230
