167
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:50,880
or for a useful

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,790
the communications back to me he is the

169
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,819
be is are the whole moment process

170
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,400
were you made it home or successful

171
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,930
you don't have a white communications
with users

172
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,609
your screw room I'm

173
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,010
hey perfectly good the Hornets

174
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,270
or and I'm mistakenly thought are

175
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,439
is or install no users are issues with
it

176
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,580
or seven-point an odd

177
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,740
people furious and and I was like I
don't worry that the wall

178
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,450
and with all the car User Communications
the

179
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,980
your ass enne de think I have social

180
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,680
are you because you know

181
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,819
and you did do your job and you don't
need a

182
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,460
you're gonna have met people weather is
it does or not

183
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,830
and then after I it's certainly my
communications I mean I had one that

184
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,500
instead

185
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,010
was disaster because I didn't really
have a shoot another with everyone

186
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,030
no one was my hair understanding it was
a

187
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,160
statement was made and correctly

188
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,760
and with no wrong and at all because I
had good communication with use

189
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,290
that's why I highly stress this

190
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,180
the most important part on the whole

191
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,399
one process as you have a Google

192
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,269

193
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,459
good if you don't you know

194
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,140

348
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,949
lhasa check have actually are designed

349
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,190
standardized installer or orenthal

350
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,749

352
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:31,340
software that install Hessenthaler built
into it so you can actually

353
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,418
use the eight and install or uninstall
does bother

yearly or monthly basis actually the new

642
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,040
the new approach we're taking the Dobie

643
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,980

647
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,040
several engineers me you know him
rendering

648
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,120

get a license that we buy whole for Mom
the other

650
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,810
workers yeah and afterwards

651
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:34,140
that spirit and with burnout the big
issues were big enough

652
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,359
worm that its hard to manage all those

653
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,000
you know when we get like because when
you have Adobe

654
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,630
poisonous you know watch their it's a
recurrence

655
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,150

659
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,950

660
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,060
it now that it has he said that they
have come room with a new package

661
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,690
management pack they had and we're gonna
try to educate her a zone that

662
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,560
