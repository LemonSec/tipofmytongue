78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,460
sideways and editing a video Kb he would
have guaranteed

79

93
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm it does anyone else like really
identifying with what it is and I played

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,320
a game that this is

95
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,810
this is partly why Sam if a lot is on
the front sounds rather be interested in

96
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,490
your head feel free to jack you know
what happened that sounds and

97
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,040

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,130
okay thank and

99
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,919
yeah I was a Indiana something cell

100
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,650
other all the same how location-based
games which means

101
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,200
you where you are physically matters

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,849
in the game that's not like

103
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:12,469
by AP playing nintendo ds I really
doesn't matter if you're playing

104
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,360
and why or playing in Arizona use the
planes ingame

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,009
these independent where you are not done
and said

106
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,770
that means and how fast you were moving
at the time sammy's and

107
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,998
and exact location doesn't matter
selections that you're moving

108
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,969
at the time you yes I doing things that
restrains the game

109
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:38,349
it tells the story and you can put it on
your smartphone and it has a new music

110
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:43,449
and it's almost like and DJ in place on
them to you linden story in place on

111
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,659
feel the story and the story in the
world was overrun by zombies in every so

112
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,188
often that we start chasing its own
incentivize you to run a little faster

113
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,939
because

114
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,349
is an easy casing and he'll be here it
is like be

115
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,909
CRB E BB be even an addy ran

116
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,330
is the saudis catching that you lose
gear and other things

117
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,479
is there and bring and there's different

118
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,399
chapters in the chapters and our line
you can get the main part of the story

119
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,759
or just landed and just doesn't work and
gym in 30 with people really a mother in

120
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,529
zombies and

121
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,199
and but I'll be going no more that

122
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,069
so the earliest location is im really
does create satellites now be

123
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:26,979
letterboxing

124
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,058
and Afghanistan in England in the
eighteen hundreds

125
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,860
%uh obviously they didn't have the exact
managing large teams lol

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,249
into lose and he would say something
wrong %uh

127
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:41,009
you starred at this table prissy

128
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,779
I want my along the stream look for the
tree

129
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,279
the Three Sisters tree which would mean
a tree that had maybe three trucks that

130
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,289
were trying to get it

131
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,509
and awesome letterboxing is

132
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,029
they would normally be some are working
class citizen rubber-stamp

133
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,860
so when you have a litter box and a
reason

134
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,490
every a reason I like this but in the
united states now

135
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,610
letterboxing in partnership you get
their news

136
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,680
parts and used to stamp your book to
prove that you been to that letter box

137
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,909
and you have your own personal stamp you
can car

138
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,960
some people find answers it you then is
the sample it's in letterbox

139
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,270
through you were there and west by Max

140
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,729
you and stamps and then with the back
stack wherever it was

141
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,659
you go on I know the boxes thank you
yeah a geocache

142
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,838
generally very similar you go somewhere
you imagine logic warranty crime

143
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,349
minus cash other never dared they rose
above ground but sometimes they can be

144
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,250
camouflaged

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,089
and once you find it inside this box

146
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,180
will usually be a logbook you sign would
you name

147
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,689
uses him me but the dayton down in and
then

148
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,380
global back cash with that usually
Austin

149
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,620
always mom in the larger caches

150
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,610
and children loved you hashing the rule
is they're lacking a two-way

151
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,300
Ranjan dash as long as they put
something back and this indeed was

152
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,430
greater value

153
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,880
tree surgery as the general rooms
passions

154
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,079
are generally going to be and now she's

being run you know and then gather some
way kind

206
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,410
visualizing the zombie energy

207
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,730

people are very pricey oriented and you
don't want the government watching you

216
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,410
you don't want anybody to know where you
are what you doing

217
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,449
location-based you want people to know
exactly where you are

218
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,699
by the location to be as precise as
possible said

492
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,110
some people inviting themselves over to
a guys house and watching this is not

493
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,600
because it happens very much

494
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,230
or less yeah and

495
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,260
cell here's another day ahead and I just
heard about this

496
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,370
drag that someone came in and told me
that after my time

497
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,539
didn't mention it I like it and let you
know that I'm construct and what it is

498

499
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,780
everything's dark in the city and as you
walk the street at City

one of the interstates are all that he
has a trip down the interstate

503
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,070

trails

504
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,850
and going at it into different areas min

505

be associated you

508
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,780
yeah she noted 100 mg specifically its

510
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,980
a tag like this somewhere and you user

511
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,600
well yeah you scan it and then you get a
point for it

512
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,899
I places you can print out a bench fewer
goods and hide them in different places

513
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,940
and activated again

514
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,100

517
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,199
because people were mass players usually
also geocache is and it can help

518
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,710
by any looking for cash I

good shop doing

532
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,010
helpline things like that yeah

533
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,470
p.m. and nothing about a million small
is

534
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,140
but if you go to a website called GPS
finally dot com

535
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,020
and people are mapping trails which I
find raining here in this

536
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,110
like really big park area and you're not
mention the trails are

537
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,350
someone who love God really don't like
to wait wait stamps

538
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,639
and some trail and then they uploaded
then you can download these trail maps

539
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,970
to your GPS

540
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,960
second your last yr same I can use caps
they all look is it gonna be a trap that

541
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,630
he

542
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,140
that way %uh and that I don't have been
so my taxes all I need is

543
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,710
time to get some sort of a satellite
lock and used it many many times

544
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,450
so yeah that people are going open
sourcing all these locations

545
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,330
is awesome casting so a

546
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,580
going and you cashing in a little more
detail there's very different sites

547
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,740
that will that they have cash is there's
old and caching

548
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,910
and and these can be changed their own
database

549
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,140
bed the really the big one on the block
is your cash

550
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,070
the house so that's that's rather be
spending was my time talking about it I

551
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,679
is run by have become perhaps the

552
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,280
at a Seattle I there are I'm here
National Capital Region on geocache is

553
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,389
around the world right now

554
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,720
only 2.2 million geocache in over five
million people playing the game

555
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,670
and you can look energy yeah I mean you
can pull up

556
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,680
a manner that is murphysboro here and
each one of these

557
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,210
up like us here is a cash you can see
someone gets home goor

558
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,910
really is there they actually made a
little picture in the car

559
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,040
by placing caches

560
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,149
is to draw the outline and the school VW
bug out there

561
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,659
see go to anyone in those caches say
goodbye niskayuna solve this puzzle

562
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,250
noted this location

563
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,270
so the only way to see this thing is I
can't match

564
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,889
not have the people that are good Eagle
there's one in Idaho or they just an

565
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:24,720
area

566
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,339
desert this many many miles across the
whole picture the trainers like checking

567
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,980
on

568
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,679
and another thing that really good
locations in

569
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,790
to so this is an example the cash pages
the cash I placed in her own way

570
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,399
%uh me yeah so cash will have a name

571
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,370
this case I it was their detention
centers I call a meeting of the minds

572
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,279
in having difficulty in ensuring
difficulty will be on a scale 1-10 by

573
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,250
and the jury will be on a scale 1-5 give
me an idea of how much

574
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,370
effort is going to be required to get
you cash so I sure AM one

575
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,770
means very simple wheelchair-accessible
literally

576
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,000
with someone in a wheelchair to get to
this cash change to

577
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,440
in people who candidate exactly what
change in his bed

578
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,530
generally means not wheelchair
accessible but say someone was small

579
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,400
children

580
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,360
a stronger really good chance your mom
get to this cash

581
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,600
stranger I jury 3 you're trying to be
like push

582
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,779
leaves after the way the doing some push
back in

583
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,000
a jury in four him you need to be
prepared for being outdoorsy

584
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,990
hassle supplies probably one don't wanna
be making little kids on a train

585
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,040
or 35 you need special equipment

586
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,070
I it's you're getting a scuba gear
you're gonna be

587
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,840
rebel I'm here and you get a kayak I'm

588
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,320
there's a a cash advance the station
that was placed by Richard Garriott were

589
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,960
British

590
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,790
so that securing I

591
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:59,790
especially to rock a rather here

592
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,870
I'll difficulty what you're buying the
same thing in the building when he needs

593
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,359
the cash

594
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,820
its in pretty much plain sight change
you

595
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,900
means experience cash it by ear within

596
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,960
half hour I'm searching half hours
actually a lot in

597
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,150
releasing harry groaned but that didn't
happen three and that they got

598
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,290
the difficulty by something serious
mental effort

599
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,680
and and there's some really interesting
because it caches are coming up in the

600
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,299
geocache

601
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,370
senior sidebars homes you have to sell

602
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:35,259
I we have time I'm gonna show you what I
was created by someone

603
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,290
murphysboro and it's a very techie

604
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,509
at he's obviously a computer hacker as
needed

605
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,650
people to go and tell that somewhere and
he be able to go in and look at age you

606
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,460
know stores

607
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,740
I and organic corn its unaudited to find
the cash

608
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,669
her but when I'm gonna marry at well
generally viewed as I get listed the

609
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,340
cash is better in the area and I'm
soared

610
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,570
I what's called favorite place and

611
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,460
over here this little blue ribbon is
your you can sort on any these comes

612
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,570
with a blue ribbon

613
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,770
someone who's a a paying member geocache

614
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,450
35 us here I'll bet your premium member

point and you can sign that a point to a

616
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,620
cash

617
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,460
bpm and then it's very useful to have
sort by all the cash is an area by which

618
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,620
have the most favored

619
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,640
points and cash is there are rocket

620
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,810
are going to have hundreds a favor
points usually word seems earlier today

621
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,080
and geo caching

622
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,290
and I did the same thing I said what's
the highest Avery Point cash

623
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,250
in Murphysboro I'm

624
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,890
an instance and a cashier the library

625
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,830
he started ornaments minutes isn't a
church in ninety degrees and 36 faces an

626
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,160
interview this in turn

627
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,350
whom were cases going through this door
and what it's dragging you

628
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,029
into the library it your town square and
it directs you to

629
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,810
as a civic shell and whether the books
on the shelf is a big book

630
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,680
and then you open it up and inside
there's a lot happening inside my body

631
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,230
but you put the book back on the job

632
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,770
now they have information on the library
in all this and what I want to do it

633
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,840
they recommend him he was laughing and
he doesn't look that is not letting

634
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,220
signage is like 10 years on people that
in mind that these caches

635
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,470
sign your name and contact now %uh

636
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,899
you may have noticed people for cash

637
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,000
is a good idea you don't wanna am saying
is many kids in the area they see you

638
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,160

yeah cash in hand you can just take a
look at

665

cash am Sam now

667
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,859
and passion maybe many different types
gashes goes back to what you were saying

668
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,140
earlier that virtual cash

669
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,930
the most miss stanton yeah a tradition
in cash

670
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,470
which means the boxes catalog
incitements its size shoe box and Hannah

671
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,700
bill while all these are traditional
caches

672
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,830
even if it's really makers passion
delaware call there he hatched

673
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,160
which is am you go to the court in San

674
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,359
you find a small James had his eyes to
the park and that's a chain link fence

675
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,480
you open it up in again isn't he in says

676
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,200
little chances use the side door and
your

677
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,810
parking lot and there's one of these big
fan heating ventilation

678
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,380
air conditioning there and yet he over
the side to work

679
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,100
light comes on and it's like a little
other in

680
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,589
there the entire they have is the cash
they didn't like it

681
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,320
morial someone's there's that little
writing yes log book

682
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,250
and there's a little boxes the moment
but slack to trade and its

683
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,490
is maybe so as big as that yes though
it's still a traditional cache

684
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,410
its its object no more the hash is one
where

685
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,910
when you go to the corn is ready cash
page you're only getting

686
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,350
who to where the cashiers for your next
who's going to be

687
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,890
these can have as many as ten different
hops firm on the cash

688
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:37,029
virtual cash as he described it might
there may be a physical object that many

689
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,710
information sometimes again in a virtual
cash earlier today

690
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,580
a chance where upward everything was
there they

691
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,740
was very partial going on with you
vintage cars but

692
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,859
had to walk around I'm certain
historical plaques

693
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,850
and finds a way answer questions what
was here

694
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,920
from 1816 1823

695

in so you learn more about Mary virtual
cash hugely important sir

697
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,759
puzzling mystery caches i knows I have
ciphers codes

698
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,190
trivia questions to answer a jigsaw
puzzle sorrow

699
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,520

owner

701
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,930
there is a certain review process there
is no you really shouldn't be saying

702
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,600
that will check the cache to make sure
there's nothing really stupid and like

703
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,990
when you put it on a railroad track
renewal an interstate highway

help our trails are those that it when
roadwork ashes like every 10

712
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,270
mile and he will raise have any cash is
a combined using

713
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,640
really time yeah a gathering

714
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,920
for cash inside a virtual cash but its

751
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,610
is the actual cm the one on the left is
the one cache page

752
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,820
so exited the

753
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,250
now is different the actual samples 24
cents

00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:02,089
ale yellow slash where you find that GE

761
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:08,240
so anyone that has no protocol SMTP is
mail protocol yellow is also mail

762
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,078
protocol

763
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,730
and evasion and yeah it was awesome very

looking at anything they have a a

990
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:18,650

passions as

1103
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,500
in order to block this cash there's a
camera in cash you take pictures I'll

1104
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:00,910
I and you don't take pictures on the

1106
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:10,129
cash in on grounds he actually a ruling
saying is let's call it a large

1107
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:10,960
additional I'm

1108
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,580
requirement it is not require only thing
you need to get credit for cash is

1109
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,540
needed by now but we need to sign in

1110
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:21,100
with the exception to the challenge cash
is how I like to do more

1111
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,480
but they can take picture yourself they
they can't make you mine

1112
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,070
you go out in your move a rock in a
certain way those those are our allies

1113
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,610
and those are all illegal

1114
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:34,760
virtual caches they no longer allow
people to place them in stock several

1115
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,550
years ago

1116
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:39,000
because be more cynical I really don't
ritual caches

1117
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,080
had like yeah drawing attention to the
words and say no

1118
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:47,380
I and the generation tell me what brand
is the 10 ish yes it was a virtual cash

1119
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,220
it was very

1120
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,000
using virtual cash so because it was
causing so much

1121
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,480
angst is that okay number rituals album

1122
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,150
NRK cash and cash for the cash in his is

1123
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:04,109
I no longer maintain his cash and
archiving is that it doesn't show up one

1124
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:05,150
day they say more

1125

1128
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:20,480
going to find the cash in a sign a lot
