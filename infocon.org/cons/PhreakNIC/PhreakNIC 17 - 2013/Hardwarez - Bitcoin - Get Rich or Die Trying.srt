1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,359
we're going to get rich or die tryin

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
neck slightly these them

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,369
what is the big 12 could apparently
money based on open-source cryptographic

4
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,259
protocol is in the pudding a central
authority

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,820
no don't know what it means

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,759
thank you we above course we have
practice cuz

7
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:28,289
%um practice so well

8
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,279
its special currency with the following
you need attributes which course

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,440
I can was probably 50 or 100 open but
saw

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,789
some things about it this morning when I
was right the speech in

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,680
my

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,040
I didn't deliver lieberman in

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,149
numbers so there will be 20 1,000,000

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,280
bighorns seeded I know when it's
completed

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,559
um they're not inflatable this is

16
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,790
um a big deal on people that have never
I'm

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,019
concert monetary policy later in the
speech hopefully when I'm

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,310
with no the thirty kicks it now I ramble
about that some more

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,190
I'm the course the limit is built
intentionally interviewed more than

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,009
later

21
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,509
there's no central authority accounts
cannot be frozen

22
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,360
transaction avoiding legacy banking
industry

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,520
no transaction limited

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,649
transactions cannot be reversed

25
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,200
Bruce increasing difficulty

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,630
to mine which course own given that and

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,990
it's the visible by a decimal places as
in 20 2000

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,679
alright next but how does it work

29
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:51,420
it's all about the blocks luck today
does run through an hour in a bubble

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,789
message 86 encryption is really quick
time would be

31
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,470
experts in the room okay

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,640
and in Salem requires

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,259
as you are knew you know encryption
requires a lot of %uh see people's power

34
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:09,859
did

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,020
turned red and that was situated b6

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,290
hires an extreme amount CPU to turn
through

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,040
good blocks contain the petr hash for
all previous blocks

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,780
and that's not him as some systems based
on a proven

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,400
word approval word species though that
was difficult to produce soon

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,510
as spies says about certain requirements
producing improve worker can be a random

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,160
process with loan

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,750
probability see what I've tried over the
years required on average before a valid

43
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,030
proof

44
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,930
were is generated next

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,170
prison word use the big point four lott
generation

46
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,238
crew so we're but I went to the data

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,810
each block are required for the box to
be accepted

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,080
ru probability of success with
generation this makes

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,489
it unpredictable which worker will be
able to generate the next block

50
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,590
that slime each block contains

51
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,330
the hasher the preceding blog the seats
blog has a

52
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,090
chein locks that together to take a
large amount of word

53
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,500
changing a blog which can be

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,010
but by making a new blog containing the
same person

55
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,599
requires generating all successors in
reviewing the work they can pay

56
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,810
this protects the watching damn

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,260
so you have always history going back in
time

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,380
but use a mind-boggling another
population

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,560
for exemplary redone to break it so

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,790
at and I'll get into well assured

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,030
so may not be thinking yeah I'm

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,720
so this is one of those so part so the
you know

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,230
puzzle there the so far have made it so

64
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,018
unbreakable and let's start businesses
that was

65
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,420
speaking yesterday then I think he's
working on time machine or something

66
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,500
it's the quantum computing going and
then you could he could probably work it

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,709
next month lease

68
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,230
one

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,530
room I'm

70
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,469
open I'm had among nodes issues with
personal or

71
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,460
with his or her points toward your
wallet may have multiple addresses to

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,239
receive

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,280
was simultaneously and additional
admissions can mean

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,869
green on demand for free that's also
important aspect how many people in this

75
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,740
room have been Cornwallis

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,550
1234567890987654321

77
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,620
14 15-16 you but also between them

78
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,580
so we've got about seventy percent in
the room I would say

79
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,760
does have a big Cornwall right um

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,070
you for if I get any if anybody that
knows more than I do and you could see

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,290
it was wrong of course

82
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,230
you come out here and at the very end
but slightly some

83
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,320
so the Cornwall its so those are you
good

84
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,480
but don't have one haven't seen when
there is an example address

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,050
that was my very first time

86
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,640
I big corina wallet address

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
what's can receive payments while of
lime

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,330
traditional wallets were quite databases
the a baby from peer to peer transaction

89
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,680
list will reseed

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,800
something about this town a PC was gonna
pop male

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,320
even when it's all it comes back online

92
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,610
and then it gets the it but they
wouldn't email popped onto it right

93
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,640
so um individual PCs that ran this
traditional wall

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,780
client but actually keep an entire block
Jane history I was talking about earlier

95
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,309
they will actually we synchronize rear
be at pew pew scheme

96
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,390
and download all these blocks that
slightly this

97
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,840
um Wembley but there's a lot don't fall

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,030
people that are in the big point
community as soon

99
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,669
room and people there in the big one
community relies

100
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,780
is the anonymity Tracy appoints history
can be used to connect to do these two

101
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,580
addresses

102
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,820
main problem is that every transaction
is publicly law

103
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,219
everyone can see the PLO points

104
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,820
from address to address this information
can identify anyone because the

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,700
addresses are just random numbers

106
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,900
what the 1i showed in the previous offer
when he addresses in the transaction to

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,590
be tied to an identity

108
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,060
it might be impossible the word from
that point in Denver who owns

109
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,240
all the other addresses this

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,890
I did the information might come from
network analysis surveillance are just

111
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,210
doing the address

112
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,760
there are some more than one website the
key

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,120
I transaction histories and post them

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,760
and if you just go with a look at it
it's

115
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,070
just the budget numbers but you can know

116
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,590
you can go back and you can see

117
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,049
this address at this address money over
and over and over and over the amount so

118
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm there is that that they'd available
officially players practice I'm using a

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,050
new

120
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,250
address for every transaction is
designed to make this attack more

121
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,140
difficult

122
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,289
and like I said previously the UN

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,800
um you been on demand for free inside
the mall at Green ditional addresses

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,660
are unique in history respect both

125
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,170
a lot of people that he meant not
participate with big points

126
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,100
um aren't aware of this said history

127
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,910
'em missin

128
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,300
includes from the saffir poke lewiston
movement the 1990s

129
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,680
officially recalled being at the

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,170
beyond hope conference in New York City
in the 1990s

131
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,330
in there was a very well very prevalent
thinking

132
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,580
arm I remember during from speakers

133
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,080
influential people in the room and that
was

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,219
we should not just Packers

135
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,540
but every private citizens should be
encrypting

136
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,640
everything whether it's in sliver it's
not sensitive

137
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,559
um and of course at that time when the
beyond hope conference took place

138
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,650
um this was no longer a pipe dream
because everybody that time had 32-bit

139
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,730
processors

140
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,610
and the PGP software was available to
everybody

141
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,630
um the time with this once

142
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,930
that the suffer pointless to move my

143
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,689
there was a white paper published on the
site report mailing list

144
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,710
proposing a digital currency

145
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,000
be money later be

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,160
dash mone why I this

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,380
is the precursor to bighorns um some
people known as some people don't know

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,910
that someone to take time

149
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,350
beginning with this um in by the bus

150
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,020
that's curious about this I wanna heard
YouTube Google well

151
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,490
mesh money and we look at more about
this thanks love please

152
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,380
why care

153
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,350
big point has advantages for both buyer
and seller was convenience

154
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,640
online shopping is he's really a credit
card the

155
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,800
for the seller there's a huge advantage
with no transactions be

156
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,870
and the irreversible transactions
transactions could be anonymous

157
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,480
keys to the extent I talked about
previously most importantly big point

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,210
has achieved critical mass

159
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,030
there are many users participating just
what you saw

160
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:00,030
70s show the rain has big one wallet
I'll we can now find them

161
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,520
the big points adrift economy developing

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,199
that slut please Tom

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,340
moved into my home

164
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,930
I'll oh yeah

165
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,310
let's let's let's go in this is a bit
slow their

166
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:28,310
him

167
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,189
me members to you

168
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:37,189
one big slime

169
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,510
mining

170
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,260
um this is one thing I get a lot in

171
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,480
yeah go ahead this with good food

172
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,360
work

173
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,069
ribbon William I'm

174
00:10:54,069 --> 00:11:00,740
thats Lively's what does that mean the

175
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,079
what is it doing money is a process
abusing your boss

176
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,939
computer power to process transactions
your network and keep all that

177
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,360
synchronize together in

178
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
is been designed to be fully
decentralized

179
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,870
mining will still be required after the
last big win is the issue but his own

180
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,699
the transaction verification in addition

181
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:26,410
to the need the very popular
transactions obviously

182
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,730
so backing up a similar between the

183
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,810
made it a point to be in CDN and the

184
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,689
so after all the big points remind
they're still be

185
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:43,189
money going on home for the necessity a
verified transactions

186
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:48,040
and there's micro transaction fees
billed to the network

187
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,339
so sometimes when you say and

188
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,930
bighorns you ask you if you wanna pay a
fee

189
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,329
sometimes the last ask you to pay a
mandatory

190
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,000
be it's in in essence a nominal fee

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,610
that be get swole back in

192
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,769
to service the miners their airplane
transactions next month lease

193
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,290
now it gets interesting

194
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,319
those the arms race

195
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:23,240
women here mines bitcoins 123

196
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,550
45 I got those two

197
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,880
like thats yeah

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,810
yet more this is a big 10 like I just
this message via

199
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,800
by um that sideways

200
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
you taking place

201
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,780
the New York you're not making them

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,740
reminds report inside the local PC
wallet be a

203
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,760
CPU performing hashing there was a
quantum leap

204
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,790
with the move to gps-based mining at the
same time there was a rising money

205
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,130
rises mining pools so

206
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,780
I remember I don't remember how Excel
use covering the corn years ago

207
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,270
setting up my wallet starting the CPU
Mar I'm

208
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,980
and didn't get a big coins

209
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,480
and it was really running for weeks like
three weeks or something

210
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,940
and I had mine 0 declines

211
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,430
and I was about to quit and I was
talking to a buddy of mine so wanna give

212
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,219
a shoutout two outlets car

213
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,380
I actually called must not use in
California right now as the hey man I'm

214
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,770
14 your name out there and said oh
thanks

215
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,010
and he said man there's no need to Cebu
my me GP mine

216
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,390
said okay so I got so the Jeep you money

217
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,550
and the I was very very lucky man
because I had

218
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,670
next slide please I had

219
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,490
eighty yeah 6850 now this is not my

220
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,210
witnesses the course image harvested of
the internet for the second slot that

221
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,590
course I intentionally rid of all these

222
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,640
images in merge the dirty here are being
presented to you

223
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,490
but them I had been ATI radion

224
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,740
6850 the ATI radion 6 heat

225
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,430
50 up it is because haiti

226
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,410
it's badass video card so I thought oh
well

227
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,110
miss three games so I don't buy that one
day only going to upgrade the hard

228
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,529
with friends now ATI in the

229
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:47,240
the emerging technology video cards in
video verses eighteen yeah

230
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,920
media created these insanely powerful
CPU's

231
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,349
you use an 80 on Wed

232
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,639
in the opposite direction were there we
create

233
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,209
payroll processing GP use so the ATI
cards

234
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,209
have shaker units the survey as yours

235
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,229
CPG you this process a 68-50

236
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,980
has 860 shoulder units

237
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,980
so if you could imagine processing and

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,160
%uh the job and that will step up

239
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,189
and the payroll process out across in
essence

240
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:31,550
866 views so it's insanely powerful

241
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,560
and then of course you get into

242
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,609
are hungry manipulation hey you
overclock

243
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,610
the CPU and

244
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,529
you get more and more performance at
avid and backup

245
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,300
so there's this whole arms race and the

246
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,459
years ago um there was this

247
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,099
drive to acquire these ATI GPUs

248
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,170
cards for the sacred doing this

249
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,689
setting up a dedicated monitors in the
basement your house that would provide

250
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:05,959
free he

251
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,229
all winter

252
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,760
and where does that work now

253
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,819
all those are red flags their part yes
those are power cords

254
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,100
so those boys right there are polling

255
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,490
probably 200 200 to 300 Watts

256
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,280
each so intercourse

257
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,180
you know hack that's been targets like a
100 watt light bulb it's hard as hell

258
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,089
it's been turned right and he

259
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,860
so you can imagine how much he stuff
makes

260
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,100
then slide please area

261
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,590
so home spinner out on their own and
reviews

262
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,910
secret imagine a step from CPU 2gb you

263
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,910
and them I'm

264
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,290
the taint of here this also while

265
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,339
means a lot a lot more

266
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,700
to other things besides the coen yeah um

267
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,090
computational sciences and math that
require

268
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,439
that benefit from payroll processing

269
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,860
all this Ted that's being perfected

270
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,310
in the last few years from to make these
GP use do this

271
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,030
you know up rating yeah the drivers and
I'm

272
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:29,050
and the yarn open CEO it is run Michael

273
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,899
um all this will feed into the future I
have

274
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,100
up computational may sciences and math

275
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,379
um the arms race the arteries

276
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,970
the arms race the arms race continues
I'm fuckin

277
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,020
yeah be

278
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,080
the arm raised

279
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,419
arms race continues to ramp up LPGA who
knows what that is

280
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,300
means I'll never forget me get some work
on 97 hear you talk on

281
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,540
the year old programmable gate arrays

282
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,740
and I was like holy Shi'ite

283
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,660
this is not the end in the next three
years

284
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,090
next three years this will take over
everything I'll be

285
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,320
RB Jonathan program is no programa in
resolving

286
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,260
awesome I'm some work on summer 1997

287
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,390
so um we do have our

288
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,630
certain applications like I was
previously talking about

289
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,480
with no computations up there being used
we're gonna course

290
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,240
there yet to become a commodity in the
everybody's home

291
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,050
but of course the great used to get
superior

292
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,280
before mister G you because you got less

293
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,610
power usage less heat

294
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,879
now the H-bomb

295
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,550
a6 you could tell me what a six then
swore

296
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,129
applications the integrated circuit you
will have been dreaming of this morning

297
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,610
thanks

298
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,409
and six RBIs

299
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,500
new weapon of choice a6 make the program
will be raise

300
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
wordless knowing and

301
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,950
well yeah their lab nobody's by the
program obliterated

302
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,340
me but that was it later Monday morning

303
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,139
the mind me a call we thank you during

304
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,340
I turn um

305
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,629
there is a there is a progression

306
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,790
a the most interesting aspect to me
right now

307
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,870
is this that progression a difficulty

308
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,540
as I more more people my name

309
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,840
the network in essence tries to balance
its cell

310
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,129
about giving away corning's and makes it
more difficult

311
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,890
so there's your arms race you always

312
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,650
you always need something more powerful
to keep up this revenue stream when

313
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,300
you're

314
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,350
a big point minor in so I see

315
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,780
with then then foreseeable future the
next 12 months

316
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,170
it may get to the point for some people

317
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,320

424
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,350
sup you say there's new transaction be

425
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,429
no that by convention or

426
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,380
um that by convention Obama

427
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,060
they heard earlier in the past often has
been no transaction

428
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,780
baby um there are

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,690
they're always were micro voluntary
transaction Res

430
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,640
and now at this point that we've all
been a little bit

431
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,490
to the future big point there are
occasionally

432
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,400
micromanage foreign transaction fees
there so nominal

433
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,100
he just it paid you go in but does that
add up

434
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,689
that open up people who are going to be
supporting the economy

435
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,370
my big one done moonbeam

436
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,209
created here best question them

437
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,660
announced this month um the incentive
other than

438
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,170
so just or if we yepper

439
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,280
so if we go back and revisit the idea

440
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,180
that I am he gets more and more
difficult than that arms race to my name

441
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,350
and word to mean anything because the
arms race

442
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,699
for the here the other um

443
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,610
open if they that goes under that view
topic is

444
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,080
what is the value bit corny because that
bob mining points

445
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,439
and I say words cost in Maine

446
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,630
ten dollars a month on my electric bill

447
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:58,240
to run when I'm running well obviously
did better pay

448
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,330
20 percent more than its costing me

449
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,300
on how I'm wasting my time right well

450
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,740
if whenever you go by that would be when
all these numbers

451
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,340
and you say okay we'll pick one is
exchanging at this rate today

452
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,800
any now it Austin me ten dollars to mine

453
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,720
and its is paying me twenty two dollars
so

454
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
monarchy mining for the next year run

455
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,010
with well we don't know we don't have
heard information about the future

456
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,240
is well we possibly point beyond 90 days

457
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,330
120 days 12 months 14 months

458
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,110
you predict that the course obviously
everybody would warden

459
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,590
in Sellwood side those bubbles so

460
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,760
the only way for this to possibly be bop

461
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,010
you in the future use if the

462
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,370
price a big point keeps working its way

463
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,320
up so as some point

464
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,730
right now if you think about okay

465
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,620
good points that a hundred dollars
declines led a hundred forty dollars

466
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,939
well what what does that mean even when
big warning is an exchange rate back to

467
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,990
the US dollar

468
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,539
a hundred dollars what does that mean

469
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,559
with a6 change rate have twenty-five
hundred dollars

470
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,190
then you've heard that aspect of the
pointy

471
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,429
0000 while

472
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,559
a big boy name its

473
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,600
a hundred dollars you know is now what
actually worth something tangible

474
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,658
so um that's where that comes into play

475
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:44,429
if the future if the big point exchange
rate keeps working now

476
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,230
then it will pay and

477
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,139
in cerebellum its human it's something
that has to happen

478
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:55,979
and that's hard to get rich or die
trying the prize

479
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,580
pass the word up because the way across
the mind the Coens keeps going up

480
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,480
and so if it doesn't it's over it's it's
all gonna collapse

481
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,399
obviously um but the network is set to
do well

482
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:15,439
the scale the difficulty so a lot of
people that

483
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,179
and I'm I'm I do not read forums

484
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,610
I hate or arms everybody sits on the
forums

485
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,229
indigenous constantly in a world where
in

486
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,020
in a worth investing in my name

487
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,870
room hydrogen bomb because

488
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,370
difficulty eight months from now is
gonna be so great

489
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,469
he even paid religious the run the damn
thing

490
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,340
so as my handsome

491
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,590
anything else said yeah I got a question

492
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,810
II other how you are

493
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,429
you and that message is not blocking I
do not know

494
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:02,430
you want an answer for him well

495
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,600
this question a question yes

496
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,290
as him measures e-journal on ice

497
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,520
and other I can imagine a signal

498
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,020
costing ten dollars right I'm with you
is currently we're

499
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,129
124 hole on sale again that big boy
whose parents were

500
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,510
124 a I'd imagine that their mission and
you

501
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,169
how do you make a just wonder on

502
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,940
sorry doesn't by a desk

503
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,799
so you can gradually so just like p

504
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,040
you have and the girl in the penny in
the bottle in your pocket right now

505
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,799
and it use it with vision that

506
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,809
I'll dollar currency to the 100

507
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,820
re um midpoint is not visible to the 100
it's not visible

508
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,960
a decimal places the 10 000

509
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,090
so I'm thats one huge advantage it has

510
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,309
is it is under deflationary pressure

511
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,330
at problem at the very beginning is not
inflatable limited with $21 million

512
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,199
points

513
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,490
so that's something that play listen to

514
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,650
this future we don't know about will one
day the exchange rate be

515
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,740
801 and at that point when you say

516
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,790
honey by I'm went to knows where the big
points to pay for mine

517
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,950
seato doling out boosting from Thailand
or where you're stealing them think room

518
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,030
then I used soul one big going

519
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,030
you need only revealed it

520
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,580
no I guess I'm giving you the market
like me

521
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,620
way raised is online

522
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,668
way more about the British about her
though

523
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,309
you know what you think in the end I'm
an absolute slightly its

524
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,370
a copper penny and you want the

525
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,439
you want to you want to take a stainless
steel knife and saw the copper penny in

526
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,820
half um

527
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,389
with big coin which that one of things

528
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:16,270
I'm this talk I'll sound good in 12
hours long there's a whole it was just a

529
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,480
fuck lost over

530
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,810
intentionally try to keep this work it's
some questions

531
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,369
I'm there's a unit of measure

532
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:28,820
called the Toshi we jus horny

533
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,879
0 0 0 00

534
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,199
0 the room mornin

535
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,339
good points so it's the possible down to
that level

536
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:46,500
so that would be better Hindi then is
your question

537
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,989
being okay net had a clear and

538
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:54,199
human there

539
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,279
that would be the him for 10

540
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,819
right there down

541
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:10,220
interview maneuvered what's going to
happen after there's no work more reward

542
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,669
for solving walks

543
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,010
although we %uh that's the point when
all 21

544
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,030
importance I was sleeping and

545
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,589
and the public holds them Maria a

546
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:27,680
leather well rising-rate having
background last november

547
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,500
November the %um solar

548
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,530
if we get we time travel bag boy now Los

549
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,680
talking about being young and happy and
having a good point all installed new

550
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,339
CPU mining and logging Inc

551
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:45,069
three weeks Bighorn in with me

552
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:50,180
the block reward so that were true they
get paid well my name

553
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,549
yearns he out would-be

554
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:57,530
if the big points which

555
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,039
you know but today's standards is a lot
is %uh

556
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,200
these in trouble money so

557
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,359
as we get deeper and deeper into this
process

558
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,910
I'm or the aspect is the block reward is

559
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,609
yeah on regular intervals happening with

560
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:20,170
from you twenty-five in November yeah
it's not every

561
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,839
2,800 pounds loss there's yeah here

562
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,150
me and minutes so using

563
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,490
back for and

564
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,189
on a date him difficult to change but if
you're trying to figure out what

565
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,950
happened to the prize winners no more
rewards

566
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,310
transactions their right half

567
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,869
and should

568
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,670
mind

569
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,800
truth at that point why

570
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,540
how much harm minors William

571
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,170
so ganges him

572
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,450
K where you will be the new price

573
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,250
greg's about $21 million number where we
at

574
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,380
that's what I play halfway good things
like a

575
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,880
I think another yeah um it's a up

576
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,310
now that we're getting the soldier has
had a slightly disrupted her

577
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,750
so you with arm you have a graph I love

578
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,680
me up now being ceded that looks like a
rock logarithmic Carter

579
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,100
a its room it's greatly because I mean

580
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,480
as we get here near the end so there's
less and less

581
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,100
ones coming in love poem

582
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,880
that while years as know it

583
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,240
um withstood you to deliver the number
years

584
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,939
modern um

585
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,030
is a that may be true is

586
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,920
some is weird year near to that point

587
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,080
the mountpoint CD and keep going Yahoo
less and less

588
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,420
so the it might be over 100 users a.m.
before they're all under

589
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,260
it will her

590
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,960
him right hitting on them

591
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,150
about will have no those implement my
questions and was

592
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,480
lip balm do you mind I'll arm

593
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,040
we all the lou processing power required

594
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,430
transactions live remains the or Willie

595
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,919
in per year transaction the question the
processing power

596
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,440
is the ended up on with the

597
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,640
mining network is a I back to so it
actually keeps breaking up didn't call

598
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,140
the

599
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,589
and then there's the other the other X
Factor is

600
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:48,100
the waterworld you see it happen as you
did

601
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,200
burned more than for the UN so

602
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,930
the ball goes up reward use them but in
technology use

603
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,009
bastard bastard learns the arms race to
the hydrogen bomb run

604
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:05,000
you don't want to argue morning your
difficulty can also decrease

605
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,520
if you have hidden power leaving yeah he
is this

606
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,740
it is that in the set the load they

607
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,500
the the difficulty a

608
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,270
system based on the mining so your money

609
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,670
right now work yeah and

610
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,150
except for you every hearing with you
were

611
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,190
you sell a home 400 right

612
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,550
for you home your greater your comment

613
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,010
yeah yeah yeah arrest the world

614
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,880
yeah 00 that lol he

615
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,700
yeah who commit a knife into internet
cable

616
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,490
angles you here

617
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,729
anything else looks like ima millions
times are

618
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,750
what on shotgun

619
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,900
I on 100 110

620
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,920
yes I delusional madman

621
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,480
a bernard nussbaum

622
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,400
go know where it is there is a finite
number and it warns

623
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,200
me billion which leaders be gone forever

624
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,819
that is correct as the overlying that if
that is correct

625
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,980
so we're or under a system

626
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,050
because a your their wallet

627
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,790
is an ass is your you should he the
whole those born

hard drive died don't have a backup all
the normal stuff he knows what happened

632
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,150
you have no reporters

633
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,430
rear pain your wallet while
