188
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,340
you know real rolled out there

189
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,940

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,760
things the whole the the we yet

194
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,300
you weaken bones to preserve the peace
you

195
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,670
here nation with more rewarding shares
these two

196
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,890
you peanin bomb

197

198
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,860
because it loses the well or so

199
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,209
we love baseball don't sit around

200
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,930
so is bare is the admitted think they
will

201
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,550
the classic study on this mother's a
loss tools billion

202
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,529
rhythm they looted the so the civil
service

203
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,410
and basically look yeah people who were
yarns

204
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,540
versus the Brewers buzzers on

205
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,370
you know the boats that were did not get
involved with this means that have to do

206
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,879
with other people the more

207
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,699
you know sort is done home they replace
the recipients who are very

208
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,740
a heart disease the diabetes I'll

209
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,910
all the bad things happen their rings
were much much higher

210
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,069
then the people who supervised who
control the last in there for him mujer

211
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:58,829
so there's wouldn't be the goals they
who's that the experience

212
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,229
goals their bodies the ball so

213
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,279
that we will always we will do fix them

214
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,459
we get always avoided well the situation
with some hail snow

215
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,670
so I wouldn't stay yes a bad things we

216
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,449
up time to your golden years to repair
things that cause inflammation is

217
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,079
present

218
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,540
so these are not the only situation

280
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,309
sugars or organism I'll

281
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,869
our bodies that think that father
maintain homeostasis is the solution

282
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,030
goes global does not release insulin

283
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,860

288
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,700
all the houses on the newsletter puts it
back but forceful

289
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,050
was leaving their homes because we don't
know who so

290
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,370
this so that we can he is like air
pollution

291
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,939
just keeps the we're there now rey de
Flore the

292
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,059
dorm room on that's the

293
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,920
eventually I'm we love you when it
happens

294
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,030
the Google's movies do that goal we got
a bunch

295
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,660
should which a person to whom Yahoo and
of course there is room supra

296
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,990
movie you drew so who usually

297
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,050
an hour later you you're rootless goals

298
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,730
what's your way I way though in

299
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,760
we were trying to the CD-rom

300
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,420
so the really bad thing is is that we do
this is certainly has a slight we've got

301
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,900
you know

302
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,540
you know good with so many bullets in
well

303
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,840
back to issues on the table is are
insulin

304
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,470
release but the sales don't respond to
it

305
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,650
its or less sugar the just is not being
able to be regular

306
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,790
you that if you should really look at
least also think that

307
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,460
problems by means on planet without
losing actually reason

308
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,300
those you thankfully yes with me so you
know it when I would that be through

309
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,899
there

310
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,500
day so it also leads to won't be

311
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,100

313
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,880
so how do they work these days dole

314
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,330
during use so evil routines have all the
kids to think about and use the shooter

315
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:25,990
left new

316

I think you have one use Mon shop

329
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,970
rises pure to the level is mostly
because of the Sun

330
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,560
rose wait mister that doesn't use then
that's not reliable

331
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,810
the other pole we want the whole because
it's got this the

332
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,080
your no sources best which is the fire

333

334
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,860
the wall so the greatest value

335
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,280

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,520
is my a closer look at a guy who they
are the house and alcohol in them

342
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,139
because you perform

343
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,480
it but that would be an unwritten rule
but that we're so

344
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,550
only gotten worse olmos is the answers

345
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,360
is no you don't need to most other
probably don't believe now that he like

346
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,889
so I'm doubts over life mu don't know

347
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,720
little I will you be there is always the
warehouses

348
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,470
they didn't well

349
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,300
the southern not so the is not
particularly really there's a lot of

350
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,180
their lives there

351
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,370

always does need more room

354
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,090
so you'll actually see the new things
I'll

355
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,240
because that's what our businesses with
these birds the

356

401
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,840
you you know you don't have to

402
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,199

412
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,080
were all we're all watching the movie
years was doing

413
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,820

416
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,240
you was this station that John Wall

417
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,490
has 0 we need to burn you're the first
the

418
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,080
for a you you know don't know that have
they didn't know

419
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,460
you may be the perfect booze overuse

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,560
because they have all these include who

423
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,280
you know class that these shit stand as
well as all the cluster on the bath well

424
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,899

a whole lot of correlation between

428
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,840
the actual less true or not but all that
was

429
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,639
since our bodies manufactured was
rollover so

430
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,670
