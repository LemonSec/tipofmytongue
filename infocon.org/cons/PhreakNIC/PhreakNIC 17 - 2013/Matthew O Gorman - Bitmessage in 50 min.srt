ninety-nine percent I'm pretty

and as trash and through service is
likely if you ever touch the PSTN

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,770
you're going to be tracked contract arm

82
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,090
so where is also who cheer life

83
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,500
up on a farm back I get out

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,009
I always

85
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,400
I the semaphore was my

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,900
I that princess

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,089
I around bernau

88
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,399
his open is ok but who knows how to read
it I

89
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,589
gourd

90
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:38,589
under my yeah well rather okay so maybe
some of course but yeah

91
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,419
shit red as in before aficionados

92
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,669
I'm so businesses I busted

93
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,039
is a started a summer months ago

94
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,089
on right before all the Sun is a star
actually happened the

95
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,249
her know the main developer of it was
kinda obsessed with

96
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:59,300
big one and ones make messaging service

97
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,360
that pap smears on the disastrous and
zone

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,589
here's why it is possible arm of your

99
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,240
here I'll currently there is a

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,020
Asino that is handing out you know where
all the beers are

101
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,818
as well as a point of failure on but the
but does not feature a protocol is just

102
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,240
be sure that the single client base
right now

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,469
you'll be trivial to just like how it
works not have a different

104
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,819
a to put in a difference see noticed our

105
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,229
connected to the owners on the it's very
pure

106
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,449
beyond that wants to bridge traffic your
totally disconnected

107
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,269
it includes the entire message so York
June

108
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,399
you're from your subject the bottom is
all

109
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,839
I'll one included envelope so there's no
information beat

110
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,449
there's no way I wanted someone
obtaining the businesses

111
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,610
happen to know who you're talking to who
they were trying to talk to you

112
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,240
and what was being said the only idea
they would have this is the pocket-sized

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,379
message on but the Obama there there's
no way of knowing what message was

114
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,499
on

115
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,979
the it uses up from work scheme to limit
spam

116
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,248
a much like not the point does its loss

117
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:18,269
the every this message is signed

118
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,229
with a it a double shot of thought well
bomb

119
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,139
block the authorizes

120
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,639
message to be on the number so for spam
aren't you

121
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,949
to inject no garbage in here system

122
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:35,050
is very expensive compared currently
where

123
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,389
Obama for for businesses would be very
expensive

124
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,669
verses Obama for you know and South

125
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,938
awesome it has I'll

126
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,340
currently there are SMTP and of a

127
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,479
providers that will send messages
injured message at work

128
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,229
in and out of business includes the use
all your favorite you know you're like

129
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:55,800
yeah

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,360
evolution or U-mass yeah

131
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,810
whatever he is really not I outlook but
that would be

132
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,340
possible begin a software free today nah
nah

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,628
we call it logged out you know yeah
Nathan

134
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,060
I while you were in the room said

135
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,129
energy no 12 hours ago and I bernard et

136
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,139
yeah of

137
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,419
one feature on the protocol eventually
is the

138
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,520
the blida mailing lists built into the

139
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,909
system so you can subscribe to you a
mailing list just by knowing I thought

140
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,029
man was like me

141
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,328
any receive all the emails sent to them
aside the

142
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:43,380
so up forms things like Twitter and
stuff to be implemented on top of that

143
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,890
message

144
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,810
prematurely because I om it works over
towards all TCP

145
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,229
so you wanna be even more models you can
set up to your business is planned never

146
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,949
touches

147
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,329
the real Internet directly and you will
never

148
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,359
never be cosby DNR's

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,620
up free software you

150
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,389
of a

151
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,420
MIT license do whatever you want with
them you made it

152
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,120
not free software that on the dow well

153
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,250
so now I'm talking about how the

154
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,430
the Pro Bowl actually works I'm so there
are

155
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,189
5 yeah five major messages um

156
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,550
each a email address

157
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,008
in bit in bed message is the is a hash

158
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,449
a public key so my fitness is ID is
being dashed

159
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,899
birch and so when you are

160
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,920
joining the network for the first time
you transmit your public key into the

161
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,479
to the nodes of other people can find
and send your message

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,189
so the first time messages they've is a
POS your public key

163
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:52,240
and then use and that appears did you
really connected

164
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,110
and Asian can read it and they send it
along and everyone of kinda

165
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,139
absorb your public key into the network
arm

166
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,189
which is a is beneficial because not
many

167
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:07,139
then it doesn't want to send a message
to you when they finally do it

168
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,059
you want saying on me here's my you know
my GGG

169
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,319
there's no action you take to them to
find

170
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:18,040
you on the network and send your message
and so

171
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,529
you know the opposite in apologies don't
get public you buy something

172
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,420
somehow find out the nation's business
address because you know

173
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,860
wanna readers in a message wasn't

174
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,759
give me his public key and I'm put down
the network

175
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,819
and after his puppy I didn't send a
message

176
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:40,259
so message is a take

177
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,500
the the resilience public key

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,649
and %um ripped your message on

179
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,350
your subject to Bonnie mom you for that

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,990
and then you run this bird work scheme
on my laptop

181
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,259
it takes about four minutes for computer
to work I'm slow laptop

182
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,660
but it does take time to send a message
arm

183
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,509
and then you with the message out all
the fears and the message is just

184
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,679
incredible long

185
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,980
%uh that gnome do anything with but they
keep asking a woman at work

186
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,730
and then the opposite side which is
kinda optional did

187
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,189
it is optional but no it's very
beneficial in the network

188
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,238
as I said of my blog into the into the
clout

189
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:27,059
and it's just been running around around
and

190
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,290
eventually it will hit me computer om

191
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,719
and he by the fall right now

192
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,089
he will happen message back so than that
my client knows

193
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,100
the are visually the act that my final
no use in message I'm

194
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,040
recent message because otherwise I have
no idea if any keep resetting the

195
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,629
message

196
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:49,309
because I don't hear about it so and
mayors a

197
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,209
the bit message is a broadcast message
and

198
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,268
this is the this how subscriptions

199
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,100
other mailing list support workers so

200
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,779
mailing list you know you have the
public key

201
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,970
member so the mailing list is a let's
say

202
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,759
there's a one if you're interested and
transferable

203
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,209
is a group that opposes twice through
this message

204
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,878
and so they advertise work for us and
this is our IT

205
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,980
you take IB and but they have this new
jersey 21 I wasn't that were

206
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,420
about the an emergency these you know

207
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,649
it so you will take the

208
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,019
you know the 9 it legal whatever the
neighbors engines in

209
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,639
and you will send it to you this public
address

210
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,170
and then it knows that's going to be a
broadcast message to those lists and

211
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,420
some third printing and

212
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,839
with the private he ho milton was the
Crimson the public yet

213
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,439
and so anyone that knows the policies I
D

214
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,629
can reverse it and i'm for that message

215
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,139
everything did you and that's on however

216
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:03,290
good the only real difference we
broadcast a message

217
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,730
is you know there's not going to happen
on the broadcast you will see the

218
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,589
processes I'll

219
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,170
up

220
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,599
round-trip I'm so

221
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,660
it the the a message

222
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,010
like nothing before %uh you have to do
this for work

223
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,700
so I the from work are native to the
good work

224
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,940
whenever yeah and it's %uh a 12 minutes
for him

225
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,660
it did the message to me so know someone
who's been worked I'm

226
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,880
and the move it was him sending his
message to his the know that he was

227
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,180
going to do memes and there is no the
nation as

228
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,449
outward and then I virtually my god

229
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,649
did looked at the forgive law so it was
for me

230
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,290
depicted and then descends the Act back
out to the network

231
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,740
today in and so worst case I would say
that given how long to hear

232
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,360
was 30 minutes between message that
message

233
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,060
accuracy them so I

234
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,290
that's how another the major part to the
protocol

235
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,980
and then this is how the number to sell
I'm

236
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,010
so aggressive Williams be stressed
however that shows you where

237
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,449
all your peers are going too far and

238
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,719
beth behrs offers unseeded

239
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,459
you get appears in the future man then

240
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,529
you I'm the peers start sending you all
the messages they have

241
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,990
the every you know blog comes endeavor
gridlock

242
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,540
it send it to you you market in a
database you know that you've seen this

243
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,500
blog for

244
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,730
down did you have to send it along keep
going to network

245
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,120
%uh CA

246
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,320
in the mesosphere you verify I'm before
you do that

247
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,440
different messages about as the villain
ever sohbet

248
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,300
business at hand doesn't have a in
Venice la chaine like big one

249
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,729
other certain rules for a mess be
allowed on the network so

250
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,089
one message can be from the future so
the messages

251
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,560
dated or data we didn't in the future it
in and out

252
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,199
asking the wrong one if the message is
more than two days all

253
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,240
did internet now has been presented
drove away

254
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,960
mom dude approval work for the message
doesn't match the rest

255
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,720
storms throw arm so

256
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,230
you have to do that works is it messed
up as well as things develop

257
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,030
you're going to relay that message on
your other peers don't see that message

258
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,280
flown to the network

259
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,280
no you do that even as messages intended
for you don't check

260
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,600
at that point because if you did if the
time it will be obvious that it will be

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,940
came with the sea well he's not sending
long

262
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,090
the messages that said to him businesses
and set him straight actors

263
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,110
up so I have done all this you

264
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,850
you have your public hearing well your
identities

265
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,880
as well as the engine is in
subscriptions that you a

266
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,730
the man was used to drive you these
Japanese trying to break the law

267
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,870
and the description goes exactly it's
for you

268
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,890
you can read the message and it is not
it starts to you at this point

269
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,850
drove away arm and so that's

270
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,240
that's very much how that works um

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
so because it is very few it's your
point

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
Greenpoint five now and so it has

273
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,160
no a lot issues like anything else %uh

274
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,750
want big issues is the address is are

275
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,940
by Bigpoint addresses they are birch

276
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,360
people don't like to hand out birch so

277
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,740
its def not been pressure mom or your
dad did you know you could pick

278
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,000
you could be good then I like getting
mail

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,490
yes you've got mail I've gotten

280
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,760
adjourned alum yeah i think is be like
we're talking about this is a slower

281
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,069
on a service that you now I'll even

282
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,920
a just when is not instant messaging
request

283
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,209
%uh it is on the time it was

284
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,680
30 minutes I'm between June then went
back and forth

285
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,800
is then a but it is also pair

286
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,159
on

287
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,460
just what about issues game going in

288
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,160
this is all here you you had

289
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,120
for new users Mike wins humor right
that's actually one of the big problems

290
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,659
that they are currently

291
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,140
um addressing I think they have a plan
to some degree of it already

292
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,280
so every bit as address is

293
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,620
is the public key as well as the some

294
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,719
the focus our

295
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,230
love it so with than ever has the
ability to shorten

296
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,090
so that you can say only give me the
shards i care about.

297
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,980
because the largely a problem because if
you subscribe to see

298
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,020
no other subscription that another
shards that night because the list them

299
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,000
all others are

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,530
and also it is losing some in n

301
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,750
anonymity so I'm right now I'm short one
because I'm

302
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,800
the owner leadoff everybody's launcher
one but let's say five years now mister

303
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,220
charen and you get sharp 13 its obvious
that you are you are a member of the

304
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,780
network

305
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,670
and I'm and so nice development and so
there's not working on a

306
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,920
the best ways with the number arms that
you are receiving

307
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,920
every message on our the way it's
probably implemented

308
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,070
is ever national network gives to every
importer has a

309
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,689
the best effort to get a different one
arm Howell

310
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,380
to what degree the increase the wrong
message

311
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,409
side

312
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,210
rent it

313
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,570
it doesn't hurt that much at all the the
way he messages are

314
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,408
arm included a which bob is a criticism
I G G S

315
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:50,619
and so you have a a

316
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,619
a one-time had incursion over over this
law

317
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,399
and not have one-time pad is included
I'm

318
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,379
with a look at her crib to out to them
so the

319
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:04,830
the the pad is the only

320
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,769
only thing the taxes being expand in the
process

321
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:12,059
everything else is there is bob
McDonnell's so

322
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,070
the miles I think it doesn't matter that
actually is

323
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,129
are I'm something that would affect the
speed as well

324
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,189
%uh the larger your messages

325
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,409
the warmer it's going to take your
computers do shots while

326
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,559
dose of art from over the long the pond

327
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,549
the work and so message probably allows
for max file size 100 many many thanks

328
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,440
to be sent

329
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,779
known as an outlaw across an hour Megan
that would take on this laptop

330
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,499
three years computer good yeah

331
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,700
is gonna leo

332
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,330
how many arming them you know

333
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,330
time no somebody one

334
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,750
morning traffic you know

335
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,990
miss home have mall

336
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,870
the morn are 0

337
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,919
ok well the way that's kinda avoided um
Andrew talk about

338
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,660
much but we never use whenever you're
doing it actions want to call transmit a

339
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,490
message

340
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,930
the way it works right now is it applies
a friend on the way

341
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,120
so up to 10 seconds on sending back now

342
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,879
an ass you are operating as rebounds

343
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,450
wager too much humility that were you
can be acting as like a

344
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,810
real pure certainly wrong connections in
an hour and the others were more

345
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,720
what clients are behind a firewall and
strong make connections to many beers

346
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,770
adrenaline not going backup

347
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,790
um but if you're into the whole peer
here

348
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,450
mo you can have your messages you can't
wait

349
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,960
and so you receive a a block bet you're
missing out the

350
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,240
did not walk together made it look like
did you want do you think this is all

351
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,360
that will happen

352
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,030
but the way they'd most messages are the
network right now

353
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,540
is this the rain delay 52 in and as long
as the

354
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,700
network is how you want it must be long
process anyways

355
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,960
the it's hard to see the germans um

356
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,270
and my cousin for you cuz

357
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,470
everything over for so evolved

358
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,930
long make Nations volunteers bus so

359
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,300
it because it is I'll just uses for

360
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,480
party what a lot of other apps Tom there
are

361
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,910
there are high desert war

362
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,050
on various ways that install arm I'm

363
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,290
United absence of or a I imagine on
Windows

364
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,310
there's a bundle resolve the gym

365
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,629
install that will give you the proxy
punishing oh and for others were bop

366
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,570
a which is a for climb that you can ron
brown

367
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,730
and threatened for on things were run

368
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,820
yet or via okay yes or a or

369
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,990
Boog and it isn't droid which is the
Free Software

370
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,810
Android store everybody's use it lot of
reading their

371
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,470
I 3-all arms the other

372
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,680
tho when was in parent houses

373
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,950
our members are not that exact is Bama

374
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,390
so it works or not all the messages from
an hour go through

375
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,640
um yesterday I S via approach

376
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,670
sleep and I process a just about 10,000
messages

377
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,620
so it really wasn't that much but we
have real good internet been sent

378
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,350
everyone Anna China

379
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,550
nyse: bandana I'm dreaming about a

380
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,909
yeah

381
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,010
with endovascular but it would be bad
for funds for example

382
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,820
I post probably a few hundred metres
traffic don't let your honor

383
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,560
your phone running this it was not done
you might have about

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,580
not busy you cannot answer

385
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,169
so is in a message that long or

386
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,010
the the other big workload the people
produce on

387
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,640
is everything a mess comes and you to
see this form

388
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
you try to be printed that's expensive

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,770
and can add up arm what was going on all
of our

390
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,420
a when I first fired up concert was
demoted messages

391
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,760
don't think my CPU for a few minutes
look at is no

392
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,580
and it's fun but none that's not as big
an issue for

393
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,240
is that b/c we're usually always run is
the message is coming to the number

394
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,200
not so fast that she nom

395
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,960
not let this it never really will be
well basically singer

396
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,260
on so come watch terms

397
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,370
right you want gmail it's not you know
nom

398
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,830
not overall there there's a bill is
enacted for Android right now

399
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,659
a but but as important as always
problems that movie

400
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,160
problematic on Andrew arm it people
wanna

401
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,510
mobile a issues I think misuse the

402
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,960
email here's a student reserved just for

403
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,280
center on concern for round trip back
for but obviously that will work

404
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,220
Brent you're not going to miss am people
did

405
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,410
to do that problema um

406
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,830
yeah everything is like is it worth GA
10 so

407
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,110
given it people most people you that
even

408
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,899
are using everyday yet a hard one

409
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,350
so my said this is Nathan and he doesn't
sign on to the next few days because

410
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,159
he's lazy

411
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,980
and moral and law up

412
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,470
for Fife you thank you my CD is hot

official.st die and I love three
different words on the nasdaq again

414
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,649
and the even more online he never
answers yes

415
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,928
well you get confirmation miss debt like

416
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,570

417
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,620
its this bank clock no

418
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,969
no and as time progresses lose yeah

419
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,870
all back of a lot of good and bad know
there's there's not another central

420
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,969
networks I'm

421
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,240
thought you were gonna this it's just
dead

422
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,330
you just assume that is that that one um

423
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,260
the other way you would know is that the
nation is being what the security

424
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,490
doesn't happen s

425
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,570
back I would know you got my message
when he replies to

426
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:36,129
or I talk to an out-of-band wasn't

431
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,590

432
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,179
heard a

433
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,110
yeah still be a problem yeah

434
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,899
so there was recently I'm business and i

hundred thousand people now

436

bedroom

469
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,980
and the reason their credit this is like
a good thing

470
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,780
is all messages on our have the
possibility

471
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,549
going to every note on the network so
did you think the NSA

472
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:33,690
home network and storm every message
till the end of time

473
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,210
Mina as though they're doing a and at
someone

474
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,539
I think equally probably will return to

475
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,669
and I will have but

476
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,159
the reason why I still think this is a
very sleek concern is

477
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,909
this at that point will have trillions
and trillions

478
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:57,169
I'll loss there is eager to different
people

479
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,510
without any idea in each side of who
their own crib 22

480
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,590
so to sift through it and say okay I
find all nations messages

481
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,539
because he's a horrible person and
they're gonna go through

482
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,309
and so first they're not just find all
nathan's outbound messages

483
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:17,250
because those are the only ones that arm
or not about inbound messages the find

484
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,240
alternate messages that were sent to
Nathan

485
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,559
then they will have to look at each
single message that said Nathan C

486
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,270
who was sent from and then there have to
go find that person ski

487
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,830
and go through all the messages find all
those those that

488
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,620
corley so to cut collapse all the
information about

489
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,939
Nathan the would be ridiculously
difficult

490
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,270
from even if you have even if you can
break the encryption very quickly

491
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,540
a going to the web all the messages is
ridiculous

492
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,020
and on top of that if Nathan is just for
fun besides

493
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,440
I wanna pick one a new bit message dress
its about

494
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,660
and his knee but misses dress so that
the whole nother

495
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,660
rabbit hole for them to chase down
Android discover

496
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,230
his messages so the actual computer time

497
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,280
even if breaking the crypto was trio it

498
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,520
it's not worth doing that they're gonna
go break his hands

499
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,250
stills laptop and hope for the best but

500
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,620
I don't have some people it's about that

501
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:24,620
the I was mean a but

502
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,490
there there are some people that are a I
think a little ridiculous and that every

503
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,640
message they send out they create a new
identity in

504
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,880
and do that just like you can do with
pick one um

505
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,730
I think that makes it very difficult to
continue conversations with people

506
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,820
this their email address keeps changing

507
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,750
but but the other thing you can also do
that but they

508
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,140
I'm recommend as well you maintain as
many identities as you want

509
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,880
so I have amor I have an identity that I
only talk to Nathan with

510
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,290
because I don't want any of our other
conversations getting leaked out Best

511
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,530
Pop

512
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,860
I recommend you all do the same as well
both

513
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:10,860
keep one special just for me

514
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:18,059
up early as possible

515
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,849
but the all showing up in a minute but
the bent message client when you send a

516
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:22,369
message

517
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,439
it's a drop-down of people you wanna
send it as

518
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,509
arm see him

519
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:32,099
%um pick and choose um d'amato

520
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,249
so

521
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:39,859
months other yeah what topic

522
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:44,239
I I

523
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,019
so this is the the main application

524
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,049
um it's really small didn't realize that

525
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:55,079
a so when you when you first sign in for
the first time

526
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,408
it's going to pop you up to the stab

527
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:02,049
this is your activities tab so I've
created a few identities I have a

528
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,129
my fricken Academy Burgess created the
other night

529
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:09,619
I have my mark on still friends and I
have my test identity

530
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,879
so arm the way create these identities
that this

531
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:16,539
new tab has popped up and you're
actually two options

532
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,779
you can used random data to create your
identity which is

533
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:22,929
the only option shiver click this other
option

534
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:28,269
steep this allows you to use it pass
phrase to make your address so you can

535
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,379
deterministically

536
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,678
creature dress arm the advantage up
doing that

537
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,469
if you do this is you have a password

538
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:40,690
but you could go on to another computer
and from scratch

539
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,879
recreate your business a tragedy the
downside if this is you have a password

540
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,449
the people can take and recreate your
buttons his identity

541
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,419
it is a greatly reduces

542
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,919
the randomness you are not as random as
a random number generator arm

543
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:03,309
say a US don't have real random number
generator isn't sued over an assurance

544
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,629
detectives arm so

545
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:11,859
then you have the option a here this
verse to forget that the shard so you

546
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,239
can

547
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:15,409
use the most available stream which is
what they call charts

548
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:19,269
arm or you can use a shard into shards

549
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:22,349
list you re-cap so I could tight wanted
these

550
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:25,220
so that I'm not getting as many messages
in

551
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,650
and I can reduce my Bama footprint um
this

552
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,460
makes it work faster and is nicer this
makes more anonymous

553
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,570
but right now it kinda move because
there is only the one chart

554
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,658
and then has this nice little thing
where it'll

555
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:41,799
do you keep creating that message
dresses

556
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,250
until it finds one where the

557
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,179
address collision that the hasher the
address is slightly smaller

558
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,460
so like your dad is here the spit
message dress is shorter than the first

559
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,230
1i generated

560
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,010
atop I

561
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,990
actually they'd just started to

562
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,590
integrate an API a

563
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,719
here said go to Settings they added
support for name corn integration

564
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,399
people that like name coined it's a

565
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,549
distributed DNS ish thing

566
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,210
like picco in remind for names I don't
really understand how

567
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,500
name-calling works I don't really like
banquet but the idea is

568
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,469
you can create the name cohen address
that's mall get mobbed acecomm

569
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,239
and then you could tell people hey email
me at market mark to come a bit message

570
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,029
in a bit message will do the query to
see who is mark mark dot com

571
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,800
but the problem with that is if you
don't have the name dot com

572
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,859
hash table on your machine you're making
a Corey out

573
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:53,089
to than the Namek 1tb saying whose mom
AGA com

574
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:56,119
which kinda repeats everything we've
just been talking about

575
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,180
you've identified everything so

576
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,279
I kinda don't like this feature that
they've been adding arm

577
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,500
but some people really hate sending
messages 2 p.m. dash

578
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,099
love our yeah exactly

579
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:14,390
um CSA you have these identities arm and
then this is like your time you watch

580
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,740
them drown on stream one

581
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,209
arm and so than it looks a lot like a
normal

582
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,470
email client you have inbox a

583
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:27,509
so here this message from Nathan that
received she said

584
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,130
what are we doing for the bachelor party
that's all

585
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,430
but not good a month ago

586
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,149
are we live that's true

587
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,120
ok.so I will send a reply to Nathan um

588
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,560
so we will by yeah

589
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,820
and I will send it from the Freaknik
identity

590
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,000
we've been talking about and then Tom

591
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,930
I can broadcast this their aims to
spread my address book but we really

592
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,000
just once and it made them

593
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,380
are and the way you could add more
dresses or so I the emails my other than

594
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,920
open

595
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,740
akimbo mode more justice from my address
book but not good either

596
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,549
concern now so you hear the the senate
processes

597
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,860
sent so now it's doing the necessary
work to send a message

598
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,200
so this will take just a little bit are
computed

599
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,700
and send it arm what else

600
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,750
a so

601
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,200
if you're sending out to

602
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,220
multiple people who aren't on a male
nurse yes you to do each dress

603
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,500
but like that option Assange there's the
option that

604
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,850
let's say I wanted to send a message to
everyone in my address book

605
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,850
who cares enough about me to subscribe
to me I can say sent to everybody in my

606
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,580
arm address book and I'll send a i mean
tender breaded subscribe mail sender

607
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,509
address is frightening

608
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,940
at that were sent so um

609
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,560
out to sea I sent the message and I'm
waiting on acknowledgement that work was

610
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,110
done

611
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:09,010
Naveen is going to get the message in a
little bit but he also %um box o

612
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,500
this is one other the public that
message down lists

613
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,960
apparently e-cigarettes guys smoke

614
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:22,960
ever right don't drink smoke

615
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,099
double down to both

616
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm CS sometimes there's weird stuff on
a list

617
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,029
but if I was work to reply to this
mailing list I'm reply to this message

618
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,980
I'm not replying to the party that sent
the message I'm replying back to the

619
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,859
whole list

620
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,680
so everyone that had subscribe to this
list will get this message

621
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,029
um and the way we manage subscriptions

622
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,060
is you will become aware

623
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,839
over and I D out a band just like in and
real mountain issue

624
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,339
the find out about Mentalist the
advertise their business address

625
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,490
and you're just admission scription this
will be

626
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,000
barb and Payson business address and
that subscribes to you

627
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,200
so but there are there are some bit
message forms

628
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,230
there's actually a very good one arm on
reddit there's are

629
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,130
bit message and people there talk about
a bit message development as well as

630
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,470
some other mailing lists that are there

631
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,649
arm there are the ones I suspect most
they are just about

632
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,290
that message before I deleted some the
first ones that were out there all kinda

633
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,259
like porn related

634
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,320
on people that were just testing sending
images through

635
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,770
just for yup research educational
purposes

636
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,080
are but they're sending images through
pic message them playing with the base64

637
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,210
encoding

638
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,830
arm and images but to try to budge from
PO for research

639
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,690
and a but they're there but message now
are

640
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,640
mailing lists for everything and
actually they added recently

641
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,710
a new feature called channels which is
the idea is much like 4chan is that you

642
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,369
have a

643
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,950
a channel that has a name an address and
the name is like the password to get

644
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,609
into this

645
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,450
secret group and the message the ideas
how you are

646
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,299
which is to try to bad road playoff
Packers

647
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,320
that's that seems highly skeezy

648
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,720
some so when for nine argument are not
running it right now

649
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,618
oca alternate that sir

650
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,830
now farther I'm one other the things
that I actually show you what kinda

651
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,470
going on

652
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,330
is this the status here it shows you
that you know I'm on stream 1 I'm

653
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,848
connected a computers right now

654
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:32,990
so that turn the laptop on here types

655
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,720
I process 697

656
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,560
person to person messages arm the
majority not being for me

657
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,840
I've gone through 1300 broadcast
messages

658
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,040
and i've seen 200 30 public keys
published

659
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,410
a Bob but

660
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,480
there have been people that are kinda
played with that but

661
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,490
but no not not really right now arm the

662
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,029
it has the ability to be runners at at
Damon without the seal I

663
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,700
so you could buy crime not the Ryan
night

664
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,549
turn on/off arm the other option to do
that to a lot of people are doing

665
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,349
like oh same before is the run on the
server setup email

666
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:17,520
forwarding from it and then just email
on the client someone on

667
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,560
a power

668
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,130
yes

669
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,590
in the pic that just to be different was
the goal they didn't want pick one

670
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,240
miner's

671
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,810
to be used the pic 1 spammers it

672
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,750
it Shah 512 double arm no it doesn't

673
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,369
%uh but it has to the the

674
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:47,470
message time a

675
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,589
has to be part the the header to

676
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:53,589
so there's a header and the blob and a
header

677
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:56,790
is where that a this the hashes is

678
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,130
as well as the time and the its

679
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,160
the hashes the passive the header and
body

680
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,330
so that the message if you wanted to but
if you really gonna spend the network

681
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,640
you plan out in advance that I'm a spend
an hour

682
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,848
month from now sits at the time the
future then build-up

683
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:18,520
tons about messages and then send them
all out but the CPU time to do that is

684
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,060
still

685
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:26,060
ridiculous

686
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,029
um

687
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,080
the the protocol actually doesn't

688
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,400
mandate a the

689
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,040
that being that the hashing out Adam so
in theory you could you could change it

690
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,660
arm the other actual very but you are up
to fret about it

691
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,810
arm so currently

692
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,870
the the the minimum amount

693
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,490
um and in your right to get a message on
to the network is is colic pick one

694
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,770
in that you are having so many zeros at
the beginning

695
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,780
but the minimum is none but you are a
lot you

696
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,720
you yourself say I'll new receive
messages from people that have done

697
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,069
up to 10 so you get your prefer work
your demand for for river can be higher

698
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:15,060
and that both both of those things are
not so much set by the protocol

699
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,340
but by the clients so if in the future
people sending

700
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,790
arm messages with the proper work level
one

701
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,370
and our garbage all the time it
everybody just

702
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,759
you know upset were clients up it it
will though

703
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,480
those will stop being propagated through
the network arm

704
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,370
South you get around that but

705
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:45,370
but he said before his pre intensive the

706
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:53,460
min

707
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,510
no

708
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,600
so the header is the timestamp up when
the computer that sent it claims to have

709
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,150
sent it

710
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,180
and so the next people that receive that
the first people to receive a message

711
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,049
when it creates

712
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,170
onto the network everybody because
there's no way of knowing message was

713
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,170
just created a rock

714
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,050
to anybody on our they check the
timestamp and they see if it's too far

715
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,830
in the future

716
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,710
are too far in the past if it's about at
that point

717
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:25,710
they relate across the network

718
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,990
sup a bad actor from throwing error
messages nothing

719
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,729
that the way you get around that its so
I'm currently connected to a people

720
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,720
I'm relaying my message eight people and
it'll it'll get

721
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,720
workers so you could there be no way to
know

722
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,190
that the message would have lied about
if you wanted to turn in your homework

723
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,960
late

724
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,910
you could do that there'd be nothing to
stop you from doing that um

725
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,720
the only thing that would that would
kinda work against that to some degree

726
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,560
is you

727
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,360
your database a for these messages here

728
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,780
the in my inbox nope it's all know it
does

729
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,850
it tells you the date you received it as
well so

730
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,400
I could know that its unlikely that you
sent a message to me

731
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,600
and I've been on the network the whole
time and it was a day late

732
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,339
I mean that's possible but unlikely that
your message now bounced around never

733
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:24,940
got me

734
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,960
um

735
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,840
so if your cock from your computer the
skirt just like SSL

736
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,170
your that whites two days it's a large
window I think it's two days in the past

737
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,790
and Mike eight hours in the future to
deal with people that have funkiness

738
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,460
like that

739
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,660
Jer tontons

740
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,549
it's based on a GMT I am

741
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:58,140
up owner on the campus you start gonna

742
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:05,140
predictions yeah

743
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,359
um

744
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,490
no its not currently armed app is is
under rapid development

745
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,750
on the bow on it features the van added
in lately

746
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,790
but the Big Bang the to kinda fight
against that you could do

747
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,320
is it has for Windows users and I guess
canoe manages to if they wanna

748
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,080
you can run in portable mode we can tell
it the keys are in a different spot than

749
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,130
the default home

750
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,190
dir to keep your keys on USB T are and
it also keeps the message

751
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,840
there's a keys database a message
database and messages seen

752
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,160
database so it to keep all three of
those on your USB key

753
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,779
see just keep that with you gone

754
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,970
it the way he that

755
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,600
your messages wouldn't be totally
instantly proofed would be that if you

756
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,190
use that

757
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,640
that the deterministic password key

758
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,029
but your message is still be gone just
would continue to be able to get new

759
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,840
messages

760
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,680
on merit any message you marked arm
beechwood act wouldn't be sent over

761
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,450
again on the network

762
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,629
you might get lucky and see it again cuz
it has been deleted from the network yet

763
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,050
because

764
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,690
be on the person that aware that you act
a message is the person that sent you

765
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,340
the message

766
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,090
because no one else knows that that's
what happened so they keep bouncing the

767
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,710
messages for two days anyways

768
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:31,710
nathan is never going to get this
message

769
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:41,040
are you have any message you process
that she turned on 2000 yep

770
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:49,569
any other questions no questions pub

771
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,180
right exactly currently if you keep
every message

772
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,910
for that window I think it's right
around the the biggest it's ever gotten

773
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,009
a 7-iron megabytes

774
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,400
that was that was being attacked
somebody was trying to spam the network

775
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,890
and so I P forced or you know these
garbage messages for two days

776
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,170
arm obviously that amount is going to go
up

777
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,430
but it shouldn't go up so much because
it never gets

778
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,640
to unmanageable levels of chard the
network

779
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,819
arm but it's good

780
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:30,819
that's big because it'll be more for the
essay to dick

781
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,450
okay so but the way that works arm

782
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:48,939
there will work tom is is when you boot
strap you're known

783
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,750
you will get locations have other shards
but you don't care about

784
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:57,760
and you can relay messages unit at the
people directly to you

785
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,350
or to the shards so the the best best

786
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,580
practice will be to just relay your
message into the network with the wrong

787
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,610
charming with the chart where it's going
to and then those people would say

788
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,700
I didn't generate this message safe for
me to bounce out to the other shark but

789
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,390
you could in theory also just directly
messages into the shark arm

790
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:22,129
the other other chart because they have
no way a you don't reveal who you are

791
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,550
when you're sending so there's nothing

792
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:27,240
invalid bout shark someone from chard
once any messages are too it just looks

793
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,660
like a message in the short to

794
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,339
arm arm

795
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,360
currently its it's just TCP traffic a
and it's just bob's

796
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,860
it doesn't seem to affect anybody at has
been blocked anywhere yet

797
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,800
there's been some talk to people wanting
to run over HTP

798
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,560
by Copyscape just for that reason pic
has been

799
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,040

803
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:13,070
we talk about and 24

804
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,630
default

805
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:22,500
alright it only allows per day in port
443 typically but some people out or out

806
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,819
I mean torrent out a poor right

is the

817
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:10,780
it's so you people that are running tore
exit or entry nodes or bridge nodes in

818
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,260
the network

819
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,520
and it shows you how much traffic

820
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,859
%uh write bridges are but every
everything else

821

two days

hour and the default behavior the client

830
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,319
right now

831
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:04,140

833
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,910
just we does the work & Sons again
