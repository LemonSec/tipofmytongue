1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,270
alright 321 n it it just turned six
o'clock for me so this is as good a time

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,000
as ever

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,760
to start and before I began I should
tell you guys that I actually do have

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,080
some companion slides to this although

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,719
most to this is kinda gonna be up at the
cuff and if you're a pic its tiny URL

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,039
dot com forward slash Freaknik 2013 you
can see the slides

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,980
I like true use the slides just as a
supplement to what I am saying though

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,050
and hopefully

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,510
I will be able to compare all the
important stuff

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,180
what what's going on such so let's see
there's a lil

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,140
if you're your there so this could be a
very close and intimate talking like

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,460
that and i also I wanna thank Freaknik
organizers especially Ben especially

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,160
well pig

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,449
and Ag more percent in a sub on it kinda
short notice that got this

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,430
I had some personal things going on so
I'm not able to actually be there

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,170
physically

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,199
but I'm very happy I mean able to be
here virtually

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,440
because I there's the dirt's picnic I've
actually been going to pick its your

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,739
seventy now I think

20
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,468
a better every year since you're fired
and every year it's been fantastic and I

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,489
think the national community are a
customer peace bro community

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,840
is really really quite worth it and you
guys have something special there that I

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,070
haven't found anywhere else

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,289
so are what start-up ever on a plus to
Freaknik him for like will pick another

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,259
area everything

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,080
because they would do a ton of work to
get this together are

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,869
so let me just start out at this
o'connor show the direction of the

28
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,100
Merida but i wanna can

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,289
structure up first has everyone here
when I say the word mamet do you know

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,020
what i mean to

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,289
Amador I mean NY app anyone

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,619
it is short for you might say pseudonym

33
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,960
or short for Anna M or basically we're
getting into trying to construct the

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,809
notion a white

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,960
identity is and specifically what online
identity is and how the two credit

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,898
better play together

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,990
so here's something also cook you not
see how many people work and recognize

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,259
that

39
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:01,200
quote Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of speech or of

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,360
the press for the right of people to
peaceably assemble

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:11,360
unquote anybody know where that comes
from okay where

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,159
or I could pick up but

43
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,649
it was okay and where does the okay
second question here where is the first

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,659
amendment come from

45
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,828
but it

46
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,269
opus is good but you guys are smart

47
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,099
okay I love it when people are smart in
the audience add next question

48
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,138
so so Magna Carta side where to the
Constitution come from

49
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:45,139
and this is working to the me to I would
say technically

50
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,469
so normally I go too hard to get her to
the federalist papers for example

51
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:56,108
alright certain but in the federalist
papers are often an example that we use

52
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,409
to promote the notion of pseudonyms and
I pseudonym it is important

53
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,668
federalist papers that were as Alexander
Hamilton John Jay and James Madison or

54
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,250
credit construct this notion to you

55
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,489
put together the idea what the
Constitution should be because before we

56
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,709
have the Constitution

57
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,159
we had this cost record because the
Articles of Confederation

58
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,129
this is a step you should have been
learning at school if you aren't

59
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,768
sleeping through it and

60
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,889
the Articles of Confederation basically
a step published a

61
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,650
government that had a very the states
have a whole lot of power and the

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,949
federal government was kinda this week
thinks kinda slung together

63
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,290
a there were a lot of problems they had
with it so for example they couldn't

64
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:30,978
enforce

65
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:35,120
the monetary policy is so in general all
the states have their own financial

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,759
policy is the normal

67
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,439
later on with the things like the
federal Arthur but they turned out that

68
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,530
they decided the Articles of
Confederation and that weak central

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,919
government they had didn't really hold
everything together

70
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,780
so the Federals came along and wrote
articles to

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,040
you know various newspapers and such San
we should have a stronger federal

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
government we need to rewrite everything
from the ground up we need to

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,668
basically a reboot the government so but
also wrote one side they're staying all

74
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,150
we should have a strong federal
government

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,609
on the flip side you have the
anti-federal us who are saying well

76
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,729
hold on we have these other things to
consider all but what about the rights

77
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,680
of the individual against the
institution

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,310
things like that at it's worth noting
the anti-federal store

79
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,759
also right in with two memes include I
think through this is one of them they

80
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,639
had a couple different systems that they
were using

81
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,280
and

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,260
the next word i think is here is really
important the FAA Federal send the

83
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,000
federalist

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,900
had a discussion and that came to a
compromise and that compromise is what

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,219
is known as the Bill of Rights

86
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,950
so in fact we have the Constitution
witchcraft a lot of a story to a

87
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,310
centralized government

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,410
and creates like the the the federal
Brasher the legislative judicial and

89
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,210
executive

90
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,590
the presidency and so on and then have
the Bill of Rights which exist

91
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,320
simply to placate at you get back power
to the people what

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,380
as well I have things like the personal
conduct and I believe that the reason

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,950
that it is the first amendment and you
know not the fifth or sixth

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,630
is because without that person moment
and without the ability to free speech

95
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,670
and a freedom of association and freedom
above the press and things like that

96
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,390
you wouldn't have the kind of
constructive debate which ultimately I

97
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,630
believe led to the cost

98
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,710
tuition on the bill it breaks so what
you begin to think about it when you

99
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,120
begin to think about things like

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,650
what kind of games and ultimately all
get to us attribution what kinda bans

101
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,950
were able to share as as moot from 4chan
puts up

102
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,010
that's what the country was founded on
and

103
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,070
we're at a point right now where a lot
of these things that a lot of these

104
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,270
principles are beginning to slip away
and there's any number of reasons why I

105
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,260
think that's happening

106
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,260
so let me sleep go to the next slide if
anybody

107
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,740
as watch it its lead pipe and the title
the slightest attribution and I have to

108
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,600
pictures on it

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,260
on the left side I have a painted on a
museum I think it's a Bruegel actually

110
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,469
and on that there's also a placard on
the pac-10

111
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,980
which is the attribution at the pac-10
it's it's I think it's the

112
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,070
that the painter up the paint and and
various things about the pattern at such

113
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,510
a rate

114
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,650
how many people pendulum is the movs TNS
said this is the day at this is the time

115
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,039
it gives you the context and the

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,580
that the painter at the that the artist
that created that work

117
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,190
and on the right side I have a pic her a
printing press

118
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,310
so here's another interesting question
how many of you can tell me what was the

119
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,860
first to really important book printed
on a printing press

120
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,960
right right

121
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,870
alright right right right so the first a
really important thing

122
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,130
on the printing press was the Bible you
guys know what the second I would

123
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,770
consider most important thing on the
printing press was

124
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,190
I'll give you a hint 15-17 as the day

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,910
emmitt

126
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,450
is really work it's fascinating the
ninety-five theses by Martin Luther

127
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,570
and there's actually a few think about
it alarms

128
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,780
a shit about this notion about tribution
on the fact that before we had the

129
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,570
printing press

130
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,810
people were able to just pass out pieces
of paper and such but

131
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,190
it wasn't 18 to mass-produce this stuff
and

132
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,660
the printing press gave us the solution
to distribution issues

133
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,840
and 30 a lot of people who cut the
ninety-five theses and Martin Luther

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,039
which work up being a protest

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,530
for the Catholic Reformation and/or the
Protestant Reformation which

136
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,010
affectively it began a slow slip n slide
at the Catholic Church

137
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,940
what's up

138
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,010
yes so so what you ought to Scott brick
yes

139
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,960
and this gets sent to me I'd attribution
and there's a fundamental question here

140
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,919
which is what happened if the printing
press or

141
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,010
probably is for example who is right in
the the Federalist Papers

142
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,200
well what happened F a judge should on
or or there had been a lawsuit about

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,990
google.es

144
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,230
and a judgment of a given to order to
the newspapers that we're publishing

145
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,060
these things

146
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,410
but muster if you look at our legal
names for that may have changed the

147
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,820
course that the Constitution

148
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,730
and the pricking pet Press if it was
halted like the catholic church wanted

149
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,180
to be in later on we get these issues
the piracy right

150
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,250
these are really fundamental questions
to who we are and how we're able to

151
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,880
express

152
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,530
or identity is and the question free one
can share

153
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,979
wraps you have this question up ever
going to say the same things

154
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,000
if my legal name is on it purses a name
that I have created as on it so

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,380
this leads us for another really
interesting question at which

156
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,159
is don't free speech which we opened out
west this free speech

157
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,460
necessitate anonymous speech and this is
a really interesting question is working

158
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,880
any internet appeared a pic activity and
things like

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,420
anonymous coming up

160
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,510
this has been coming up a lot and there
is one Supreme Court decision one

161
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,610
Supreme Court case the all credible

162
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,900
else back to an every single legal
decision that's coming out about an

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,360
honest answer for into it

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,020
it's a case from 1995 called mcintyre
verses Ohio Elections Commission

165
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,670
added but that's just not the case is
that there was

166
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,790
this woman I miss mcintyre and she was
in Ohio passing out leaflets

167
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,490
basically it with a political statement
on them I think it was a cast the

168
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,900
commission or something like that

169
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,090
and she was arrested because pp help
with that she was passing out

170
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,260
did not have her name or affiliation on
them there

171
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,610
were is this close to what they could
say before we had the Internet is

172
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,210
widespread it as it is

173
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,220
a on a must because there was no name
attributed to it

174
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,460
and but what decision came in nineteen
ninety-five

175
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,490
and the decisional was in favor a Mac
tire and

176
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,420
he majority decision was are made by
Justice John Paul Stevens

177
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,199
and there's a quote that I really love
from it which is anonymity

178
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,550
as a shield from the tyranny of the
majority and what do you think about

179
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,020
what that means and the social
implications about the fact that every

180
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
amazing idea every invention we have had
whether it's LA ok

181
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,780
par de Caza everything else started out
as a mentor a decision that they had

182
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,949
these people had to work

183
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,450
against me pull up the establishment in
order to craft a radio out and get

184
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,020
positive discussion going on

185
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,520
this is something that I think is
fundamental to democracy in general and

186
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,240
in particular to the United States

187
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,590
so there's two elements to attribution
that I want to cover

188
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,640
first his reputation that is how do I
know that this

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,990
information time-c_n_n_ is noteworthy
how do I know I should give it any

190
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,260
credence whatsoever and that notion of
credibility comes into play

191
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,410
how do I know that when I'm seeing this
thing on Twitter for example

192
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,530
that I should pay any attention
whatsoever to it

193
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,439
and the second is accountability
accountability mean if somebody commits

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,790
a crime on the internet or anywhere else

195
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,410
I need to know how I can bring that
person at justice we have a steering

196
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,829
supplies we have a system of laws in the
United States and many other countries

197
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,350
well how do we bring people to
accountability how are we uphold that

198
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,140
sense a justice and that system applause
but we have

199
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,160
and ultimately a boiled down to how do
we are pretty pain the social contract

200
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,680
so this getting a cut in the
foundational what's going on

201
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,959
it can kinda see how this pieces
together and permeates through

202
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,029
non-technical existence how do you know
that somebody is reliable right

203
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,829
and this gets also into the notion of
trust how do I know that somebody is

204
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,349
trustworthy and then after thinking

205
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,910
all what is trust actually mean is that
I trust

206
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,009
are there different types of trust so
lake within

207
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:13,079
a PGP key systems for example I can sign
somebody's key in that says that I trust

208
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,929
them and there's these different trust
level 01 2013

209
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:21,279
but what does that really mean and what
if i trust somebody with money but I

210
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,619
don't trust them to be

211
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:26,189
at work on time or if I trust somebody
to be at work on time but I don't trust

212
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,829
them to babysit my kids

213
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:30,910
at these are all questions that are
overly fundamental

214
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,999
and they define the nature up human
communication human interaction and

215
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:35,509
general

216
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,170
so that all we turn to this notion I
have the next slide up here

217
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,829
call what are called Google's method it
creates this very hierarchical structure

218
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,160
where at the very top you have what they
call a real name

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,350
which is usually a driver's license it's
usually something that's issued by a

220
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,779
governmental authority

221
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,689
or but let's say the physical
manifestation alone a call a central

222
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:58,179
authority

223
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:02,749
so in the same way that if I want to get
in SSL certificate for my website I go

224
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,269
to Verisign or something like that and
as a CA

225
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,279
big rat me this authority that I can
then use in the train to trust is

226
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,470
therefore derived

227
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,769
at the same token the government gives
me something to

228
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,540
that I can then presented by going to a
bar at a course on the question if they

229
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,589
ask is why is it a bartender or at the
bouncer at the bar

230
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,240
accepts that document that physical
token that says yes I'm

231
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,839
you know over the legal age as opposed
to recognize it me or if I told them why

232
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,990
do they not trust what I say and they
trust that document the steps and there

233
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,610
are good reasons for many that I'm just

234
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,120
asking people to think about that for a
moment so within this hierarchical

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,290
structure we have the government issued
ID at the very top

236
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,649
then in kind in the middle ground in
this what I'm calling Google Smith that

237
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,790
you have pursued and that's right
because sudan literally means it comes

238
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,569
from the CPI

239
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,019
pseudo work pic so when you have the
real name a fake name dynamic and you

240
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,300
can already see where

241
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,699
effective or the embers every oh and
then you have this binary notion a true

242
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,190
and false trustworthy at untrustworthy
and

243
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,380
in and out so I'll its captioned with
this notion that I

244
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,790
have on the diagram which is that labels
give someone else power over you and in

245
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,660
this case to be a central government

246
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,839
writes a back or we're talking about
police and the federalist papers on a

247
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160
bill a press which comes to mitigate
that power

248
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,949
well who is it that has this power and
how do we craft where does the concert

249
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,880
come into play

250
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
at the lab thing I haven't steiger
premise that

251
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,250
the real name the things that the topic
this higher you are more legitimate and

252
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,520
then

253
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,210
the pseudonyms or that the nicknames as
one might call the more than that

254
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,720
mitnick

255
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,870
came as a bit different is less
legitimate and

256
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,480
what is legitimate mean does that mean
something we want to allow within our

257
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,000
system

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,680
or something which is less legitimate
should be less close to the course that

259
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:44,969
the

260
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,090
excluded Minister of things that I think
we need to think about

261
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,550
so then the next flight I have here

262
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,740
the caption on it is what are the
challenges with the real name

263
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,030
and quick question what people here
think what I say a real

264
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:03,140
when i say real time once you're born
with

265
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:09,480
okay anything else okay

266
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,140
but the test your current identity I
like that one a lot because

267
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,280
there's what's called the identity
community essentially

268
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,800
edit nobody can actually create what the
word identity means

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,439
and I think that's kinda funny by people
who are like a really high up in places

270
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,690
like up a Pell and other places

271
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm not going to name names but it's
been kinda colourful watching this

272
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,610
discussion going on and nobody can agree
on the terms

273
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,600
but well I think that the phrase real
their stupid as I think about what about

274
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:36,940
them

275
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,350
is this conflation ovary only about with
legal name

276
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,350
Leone AP and the name on a legal
document like a driver's licence

277
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,010
or name crafted you by government and
some other form right and then

278
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,020
there's the alternative for sugar free
all which is a little bit more nuanced

279
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,040
and that is than am but I know you by in
a real-life

280
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,890
because you have the IR al tumble that
we all up in your satire see you know I

281
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,260
receivers that I R L

282
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,460
and thinking about these two notions

283
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,690
ok real real existence and and so on are

284
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,770
just which echo the next few things in a
couple points that I have about

285
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,819
why I have a problem with real name in
the term

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,050
in the context about ego identity is

287
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,099
there are negative implications for it
so for example

288
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,850
what's the opposite of real I mean I
just after this earlier but

289
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,220
anyone take

290
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,279
up a surrealist pickets untrustworthy
its in what something which is outside

291
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,540
its system right let's

292
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,829
that's really negative you want people
to you working together if you don't

293
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,270
want to

294
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,589
yet collaboration not like people coming
in trying to disrupt things right

295
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,500
and then on top of that a somebody
mentioned before the name you're born

296
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,830
with and perhaps Thursday

297
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,370
lacking agency involved in that a lack
of ability to decide for yourself

298
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,760
what you what to say and how you want to
say it because I think many of you will

299
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,200
agree that the name that's attached to
whatever you say often influences what

300
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,920
you say and who

301
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,839
to come you say it and besides that we
shouldn't be stuck with something like a

302
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
real name because it simply substituted
with better alternatives like

303
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,420
give a name like a birth name Michael
you lame at all these different ways

304
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,979
but the thing as well to use this names
and passwords in these labels

305
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,550
etc it's a filter by which we understand
interact with

306
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,250
how these names are cast so if I
introduced by one name versus another

307
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,920
it's going to choke collar

308
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,800
in a social sense the relationship that
I have with the person to the entity

309
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,479
with whom i've introduced myself

310
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,040
and there's a big long discussion about
where this concept comes from

311
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,719
earliest I have personally been able to
find was

312
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,570
henry the second as he was created in
and I think the 1200

313
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,600
the no shit English common-law where if
senator Vitter 1066 and William the

314
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,010
Conqueror coming in because american
laws also derived from English common

315
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,470
Law

316
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,390
in fact when we came in creating the
Constitution we actually borrowed

317
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,410
English common Law

318
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,969
week we left behind a number of other
things like the monarchy but on

319
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,630
at and it's questionable whether we have
ourselves we created this monarchy and

320
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,020
its former the presidency and the
executive branch

321
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,220
but going back to henry the second know
what was going on there that they had

322
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,020
always okay so that all these little
basically hopper Trier's

323
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,270
England their caster out all over the
place and they need to come up with some

324
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,069
way to keep a centralized track
everything and I N

325
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,220
that's the point at which they began to
soar to formalize what now

326
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,329
aims were and how the government in this
case P

327
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,129
K-mart up underneath the second was able
to recognize them

328
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,380
other a there are

329
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,409
other elements to this so for example
there's a fantastic talk from

330
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:34,630
twenty-eight c3

331
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,950
German conference by AR a caspase the
guys never the talk is called what is in

332
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,419
a name

333
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,120
where he goes into the notion up the
Catholic Reformation

334
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,449
as whim action before during which the
Catholic Church actually been writing

335
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,770
down the names of all the babies who
have been baptized

336
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,590
so they could have a definitive record
if he was a Catholic who was a heretic

337
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,879
and on the flip side you have the
discovery of the New World all

338
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,460
where because the Kings ok say I think
it was still a pup span

339
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,090
were unable to go back and forth across
the Atlantic

340
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,699
or turnover can they had to have some
credible way to maintain their authority

341
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,740
and they're all so they began keeping
track up

342
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,740
who was that that is in this kingdom
that I am in charge up so

343
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,289
these are some things that I just want
people to get better as we go after that

344
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,200
so the next slide but I have here it's
called my own method incredible response

345
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,500
to Google's method

346
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,909
at the caption here is that labels help
define relationships

347
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,980
at there's a lot that I can get into
unfortunately I don't have enough time

348
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,710
for

349
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,679
but before I dot abandoned us how many
people you're familiar with that Carl

350
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,130
Jung

351
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,909
and like the conscious and the
unconscious okay

352
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,309
so to put succinctly the conscious or
the rational are

353
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,940
words simple things like that something
that I can attach to an economic

354
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,679
state mathematics for example and then
you have the unconscious or the

355
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
a rationalist young cause that and
that's more your emotions and mood an

356
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,090
instinct that things that can't quite

357
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,928
easily be defined and in fact what are
the things I want to say is because

358
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,679
if you say a word or a simple we all
have our own different interaction with

359
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,289
what those words and symbols are

360
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:09,460
but that some boasted cost that that
simple as objective in a sense I can

361
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,860
draw a letter I can try like I i've
drawn the number one right now

362
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,059
its metaphorically speaking I suppose
everyone understands what that means for

363
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,520
everyone can see that

364
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,650
you can use your senses to interpret
that but it's understand the meaning

365
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,900
that is a very subjective thing so you
have this to an amicus up subjective and

366
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,760
objective right

367
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,340
and then when you translate this that
and I i pictured Pestana Porto bien

368
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,178
young single

369
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,150
temple

370
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,860
because they have the black and the
white up the A&E and they can spend the

371
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,189
entire outer ends kinda grayish

372
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,310
the uncertainty of the inning at least
and then when you look at that you're

373
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,290
hearing it as

374
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,879
its Belova social system that being
yourself

375
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,540
yourself represented all your emotions
at all that the the interactions that

376
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,379
you have with yourself

377
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,260
as a system well then you look at any
other system and I to find Twitter I

378
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,810
define Facebook and even your driver's
license

379
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,970
each of those are their own three
different says social systems right

380
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,440
there

381
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,500
a system P in a way that you can
interact with it right so

382
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,980
when you have yourself is a system and
then say a social

383
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,840
network or an online social network like
Facebook or Twitter or something else

384
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,189
its a relationship that you have between
them which constitutes

385
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,310
what I would call how to put it

386
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,540
assisting you have that relationship
between them and then it's that labeled

387
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,310
that you fix to describe that
relationship which

388
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,159
I say is your name and the beautiful
thing about that is when you define it

389
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,580
as a relationship rather than just a
label that slapped onto something that's

390
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,449
for India

391
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,500
is that your able to have with the

392
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,920
a relationship all the property is up a
relationship that it offers so

393
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,200
things like concerts things like trust
thing applic chronology and things like

394
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,440
establishing a reputation all these
different things and it's all consensual

395
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,260
and it's all mutual it's a very two-way
thing as opposed to some

396
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,870
10 p.m. granted by an authoritative
figure you have a

397
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,250
relationship which is by definition two
ways at

398
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,120
there there's all kinds of stuff if you
want to look at the slides for up online

399
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,419
and tiny URL dot com forward slash
Freaknik 2013

400
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,970
but this is something that I think it's
kinda people

401
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,150
pivotal the crotch what I am doing and
the

402
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,950
freestyle have to describe this or the
last local was that labels hope somebody

403
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,670
else maintain power over you

404
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,040
in this case that is that labels help
define our relationship

405
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,240
so I can tell quickly into the National
what to protect the games are because

406
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,080
NEMA as I said before it's kinda short
pursue them in a pseudonym beer

407
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,899
and name it that is used to hide a base
name which by definition means that you

408
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,850
have two names are you have the
pseudonym and many of the basename so

409
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,490
could be

410
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,200
your legal name or your pace name is
John but everyone calls you check

411
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,950
yeah im but I think if that is the
pseudonym but it can be in some cases

412
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,320
they can also be considered and

413
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,850
name in fact if you have a nickname and
a pseudonym it could be one and the same

414
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,899
and it's interesting how we take these
labels are you still able to

415
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,199
differentiate the

416
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,000
that the ways in which we describe
relationships so past that you have

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,769
things like appalling them into montana

418
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:02,130
appalling them it's simply not up on
them so John Smith and that I'm on em

419
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,149
is simply a one-man or one word are some

420
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:09,029
but should say so one example them on
here as press

421
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:12,539
and I guess the name yet before that was
the artist formerly known as prince on

422
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,090
any track it down to that funny little
things i'm looking thing right

423
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,730
and then one of my favorites is that you
have the autumn which is the name that

424
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,440
has bestowed upon oneself

425
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,409
different from a student at present are
name is in itself a base name

426
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:30,159
so let's see I'm slowly running on a
time I don't know how that part is that

427
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,330
I ramble so long about these things but
I've still got you guys to have a party

428
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,210
all the death yet

429
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,539
so there's a couple things how many of
you have seen at the website and Mr

430
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,158
Right Start or

431
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,460
if you're a and while I am writes that
organ basically idea

432
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,269
take a cfnm wars at all near Morse was

433
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,440
when Google+ came through and there is
the spending everybody for you then to

434
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,299
name it they thought that not look real

435
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,450
in fact Google actually again echoing
test from the said name shapes Mames

436
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,889
so into response to that we have created
this organization by we I mean

437
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:06,330
some friends of mine including coolio
whose identity woman on Twitter and a

438
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,009
few others

439
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,460
we've created this thing called member
rights and the purpose that name right

440
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,509
just to establish individual agency

441
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:15,740
and the good people at channel by which
they can

442
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,789
advocate for something that they believe
in this case it's going to be

443
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,509
in my opinion free speech in the notion
about tribution and there's a couple

444
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,799
projects that we're working on right now
getting in right side or this kind about

445
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,759
a wordpress blog that we have said I
we're we're keeping track events like

446
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,970
this that we're speaking up

447
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,190
we also have stickers and we also have a
nympho car because

448
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,639
it turns out that well everyone in this
room I'm pretty sure

449
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,990
it's at least somewhat sympathetic to
beat them well morals and

450
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,460
a mission that we're striving towards
not everyone here and it's not because

451
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,580
their guest it's because they don't
understand that

452
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,269
so by taking this member rights as a way
to have been able people but also as a

453
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,269
way to educate

454
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,490
weekend which Tremblay weaken basically
it was our for the printer but we can

455
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,450
literally it bring the late to people
and say

456
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,790
this therapy a point

457
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,270
and we watch it undershot so that we can
have a positive discussion about it

458
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,080
so there's a couple projects or working
out with the name name right right now

459
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,409
and one of them is what I call that
number it suspended project

460
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,240
and it's similar in a sense to Wendys
alters showing back so she's been

461
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,860
documenting all the

462
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,929
cease and desist orders and takedown
notices the people are getting

463
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,790
in this case I have a lot of course
setup so if somebody has been

464
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,450
suspended by say a social networking
site or really anything else but

465
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,250
they can submit their details are trying
to create an online

466
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,890
documents a tip history what's going on
so I'm looking at it right now on

467
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,650
if you remember it started just look at
the top it says been suspended you could

468
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,590
fill out a form in

469
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,820
yourself added at most a number from
Google plus because Google is actually

470
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,480
still continue to do the suspensions
it's just not as highly publicized

471
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,660
anymore

472
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,860
up era people who work at it up but
they're like sex workers and thing

473
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,240
a.m. people who r sex bloggers that
people who are dealing with topics I

474
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,670
believe really should be discussed but
they cannot

475
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,860
in many cases fight the router itself
quite

476
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,280
for themselves up in either because they
don't know but I'm or because they have

477
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,050
a danger of having multiple

478
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,399
names right that it is a context link
together so

479
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,850
and try to keep track up names and

480
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,689
descriptions that things like that on
this member at suspended project

481
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,690
and we can begin to construct an area
but what it is true it is that these

482
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,860
people are it's not just a bunch of kids
script kiddies on things looked at it

483
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,830
real people with real concerns in real

484
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,389
issues perhaps it's the but that the
person who is into something

485
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,280
controversial

486
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,160
and she doesn't want to get excluded
from Baptist Church right and she should

487
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,020
be in my opinion allowed to participate
and both the Baptist Church

488
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,410
and whatever that taboo area is and this
is the

489
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,700
a tool that we can give to those people
so that they can it

490
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,960
have the power to ill continue and have
people put on their behalf

491
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,520
so at the next project that we're
working on we haven't watched a website

492
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,840
for this yet but if people in the
audience are interested please approach

493
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,280
me

494
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,200
so all open new doors in the suspended
things that happen were

495
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,410
that pose a what was called their real
names well see the Google thing

496
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,320
that they could go real names policy
after it turns out that

497
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,418
everyone who I know of who has been
suspended from Google Plus

498
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,779
moment has albany is enough a Google
account

499
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:20,700
so it to her turns out that if you have
a collapse account and many of you

500
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,379
probably use the Google Apps account for
work and other things

501
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:28,570
it's a bit different because as a
company you can set your own policies

502
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,158
so we've actually got it created our own
it names policy that we put in to get

503
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,730
her been among other places

504
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,769
and were created a Google app the count
that we want to give the people

505
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:41,080
through we believe should be able to
express themselves in any way that they

506
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,658
choose

507
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:47,179
on Google+ without the coffee outs that
come with I think are unfair

508
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,820
from Google it's going to be a really
interesting to see what happens we're

509
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,859
trying to construct the to a two-month
study were trying to get

510
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,399
I think up the top pay people involved
in this where people just come on to

511
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,109
Google Plus

512
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:01,830
begin interacting with that as regular
people except that the years that a name

513
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,090
that

514
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,269
teams maybe could go out like that and
we want to use this to demonstrate first

515
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,320
that people can ensure I experienced to
have a relationship with school logo

516
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,629
in a way that but there's nothing
problematic that's going to come from

517
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:19,658
if something does per come from
problematically that we have the tools

518
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:22,119
resources within our community to deal
with that

519
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:26,369
it's going to be a really interesting to
see because I don't believe that could

520
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:26,928
cause actual

521
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,389
ever actually challenged anybody who is
just in a paid account

522
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:33,488
and once you introduce money into the
equation

523
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:37,440
because at the moment it be just you tho
typical Google account

524
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,619
if the free service and you are
basically far you're basically given

525
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,100
them data and you're there

526
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,649
product your your other algorithm for
use in a seoul data marketers are not

527
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:46,418
the customer

528
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:49,789
but in this case you would be their
customer because it

529
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:52,929
click buy books a month for account or
something like that a

530
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:56,029
I think that that change the dynamic in
a creek create a different kinda

531
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:56,830
contract

532
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,619
and when you have these two different
policies interacting with each other

533
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:05,109
I'll be very interested to see what
happens so what are the discussions

534
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:08,739
we've had with the ides GD identity
ecosystem steering group

535
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:13,399
they cover ninety thing I've been
working on areas what is denied any

536
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:14,139
provider

537
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:18,109
is that Google or Facebook from him you
get something you you get this token

538
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,889
maybe it's an Open ID type thing

539
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,789
and if that's what it is then it could
the service that were created

540
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:25,610
also be

541
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,649
nm a friendly I don't the provider and

542
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,910
it last thing I want to stay here
because a

543
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,600
in or like Apple caramel them that long
but you can join in the ides you

544
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,928
discover many thing I'm or county can
email me

545
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,270
our Twitter me at aesthetics that aste
TI X

546
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,990
on Twitter air please join this
government is tough because

547
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,530
pp stic miss sticker and stickers they
called the national strategy for trusted

548
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,100
identities in cyberspace

549
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,530
because if we can get people involved
and you don't have to do much

550
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,070
if you just want to sit there and boat
against things that you don't think are

551
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,710
okay

552
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,720
that's OK too you don't you don't have
to do anything except coming up

553
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,750
10 minutes every air and boat on bad
policies to to it to work as a democracy

554
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,900
hope to make sure that things don't
happen

555
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,910
there is no charge and I have joined on
stick as aesthetics

556
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,890
and any book can join you don't even
have to be a US citizen

557
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,480
so I think why I'm going to quite a

558
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,090
said ok back and see if anybody has any
questions because I feel like I've

559
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,178
covered a lot I wanna see what people
think I have about 15 minutes left

560
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,500
before I have to take off

561
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,500
so are many questions so far take the
bike if you have a question

562
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:46,059
email question that

563
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,800
wondering about how the policies the set
up on Google

564
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,840
and what exactly you're sirs
specifically did ready to

565
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,800
defend against or deflecting bright
right

566
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,178
so the policy step but there's a couple
other elements to it

567
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,390
and whatever just to create something
period

568
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,790
works aggressive policy so that this
tutorial reasons that we're doing it

569
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,340
whatever

570
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,449
to create this kind of a chicken fight
between Google's real names policies on

571
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,950
our own

572
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,170
I will I what sweater a link to the a
policy that we're putting together

573
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:31,500
but its basically what is it about that
we can have a technical

574
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,850
failures that every social every digital
system has right now because there's

575
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,780
certain things like sequel injection
type stuff

576
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,230
that we're just gonna run into problems
within the same time how do we mitigate

577
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,320
those what the same time respecting
people's

578
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,678
abilities to express themselves and then
there's the account to be a

579
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,480
accountability issue on top of that so
the real thing that I'm interested in

580
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,140
doing with the side any policy that work
rafter the spams policy I should say

581
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,230
is I have no hope at all

582
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,370
up getting Google they're like swap out
but also with our policy I don't think

583
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,139
that even work

584
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,600
address at all cuz Google is this huge
monolithic entity and we're just a

585
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,129
car more radical advocates that are
trying to do something we think is

586
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,140
positive however

587
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,520
there are a lot of companies right now
they're coming onto the internet and the

588
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,750
crew set up services and are trying to
figure all what do we do about

589
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,240
names and how do we handle that right
now I may be their service where you

590
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,520
have to sign up but the name

591
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,160
and I think the advantage there will be
a reach out to

592
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,170
those people and get them to set up a
little policies

593
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,440
and all other services to grow over time
I think that's what the real meat

594
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,600
evidence that I'm also rejected on
technical places I've been reaching out

595
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,230
the law enforcement for example

596
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,320
because this gets back in the
accountability issue is all our people

597
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,970
are think it

598
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,100
did somebody say something no

599
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,879
okay

600
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,200
so yeah accountability issue and that
have if somebody commits a crime

601
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,700
well how do you bring them to justice
and I think that's a very valuable

602
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,390
question

603
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,740
and I think that working with law
enforcement and with people who

604
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,800
are dealing with things like thick paper
for example

605
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,730
how much a paperless transactions are
fraud now a coarse paper also a bit

606
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,600
different because

607
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,590
II should differentiate something here
you have the difference between

608
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,879
financial an expression so with Pay Pal
for example

609
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,540
they have different types of policies
but a lot of those are placed by law

610
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,440
so if I'm you on what money issues so
western end up a pellet as they bring

611
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,030
those

612
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,570
I actually on in many cases there are
laws requiring people to use their legal

613
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,040
them

614
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,720
but we're also laws protecting them
another example is the public health

615
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,460
care a

616
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,300
for doctors and hospitals that a move
into medical information and such

617
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,840
yes there's only or requirement for
people to have their legal names on our

618
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,790
but there are also legal protection so
that their identities don't get

619
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,570
compromised

620
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,669
so and the United States I believe
that's only legal

621
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,750
and a medical in Europe they have a
group called ESO and then another one

622
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,300
called

623
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,450
you see it HR was at European Court of
Human Rights

624
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,300
where not only do they have a court
which is established

625
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,060
with if system love a policy is the laws

626
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,429
which addresses a all data like
especially all that if there's some if

627
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,820
there's a website that is your day

628
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,540
on the European server and European
service that is online they are required

629
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,330
by law

630
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,360
to if they get any kind of intrusion
already kinda security compromise to

631
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,189
report that

632
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,890
basically think if hit by an imagined
couple was applied to every cut every

633
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,360
internet service including a reddit

634
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,820
so on top of that ECHR also consider
construed as a place you can go to

635
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,110
report infractions

636
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,469
so for example if I'm using Google and
Google asked me for my government issued

637
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,020
ID eight

638
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,240
I could actually then go to the school
or

639
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,930
at the airport Google for violating the
policy getting to that point is kind of

640
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,140
a pipe dream and I think the policies or
try to instantiate

641
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,990
are crying about a stepping stone in the
right direction so if you think about

642
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,210
that

643
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,180
wanna be it's basically like a purse
strap adopt over document we put out we

644
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,390
think is really useful

645
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,010
will send it out to different places and
get them to respond we can't do this

646
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,810
because

647
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,870
and that creates an exception that we
can add another policy if that makes it

648
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,159
more robust overtime

649
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,909
there was a little long when did this
answer the policy question up

650
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:19,560
yes ok are there any other questions are
kinda pick a random topic to ramble

651
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,350
about her

652
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:27,350
ok what's a good resource for

653
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,240
arm because I know there's the there's
one that protects

654
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,909
that's a bunch worries that protect
people in and privacy thats

655
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,000
on sees has a definite but is there a
good website that has that type A

656
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,480
the FF the dimmer than a move but that
there's a good research for that type

657
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:46,800
I'll

658
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,140
news on because I didn't even know about
the Google names thing in my actual last

659
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,710
old-hat

660
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,020
Google spelled backwards so I wasn't
included in that group F lee sin

661
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,160
okay so

662
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,450
are you looking for resources keeping
track of things like that are you

663
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,759
looking for resource

664
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,760
art that will empower you more yes ok

665
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,380
I as a

666
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,119
site for Newser for updates on this
topic so

667
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,650
thats old trick you right now because
there's a whole lot a gray area around

668
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,230
us

669
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,630
I would I mean to follow me on Twitter I
usually

670
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,930
rabble about this a lot we're trying to
push things we have in their rights

671
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,828
mailing list that you can subscribe to

672
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:38,619
if early ides Xiong its I 88

673
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:42,589
like butter zaidi ecosystem not working
and there's a lot of discussions going

674
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:43,470
on there

675
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,029
it's a row a really large ecosystem
events a.m. past summer the surveillance

676
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,270
stuff that is going on right now
actually fits into this

677
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,200
I think snowed in is actually address
the stuff a little bit in terms of ways

678
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,549
that you can become more empowered on
your own up

679
00:35:56,549 --> 00:36:00,109
aren't just gonna love me for saying
this but let prancer Downey

680
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:04,029
who actually gave a talk at Dragon Con
what about the stuff she works a company

681
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,369
called

682
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:09,420
a bind thats API meee dot com
event-based specialized in

683
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,670
basically that they specialize

684
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,049
it there's two things that I know that
they're really do well one of them

685
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,869
is they have a service call do not track
where all actually cleanse your arm

686
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,420
your information from all these
different websites and you can actually

687
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,339
pay the man a monthly fee I think

688
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:29,279
an they will keep taking it out so that
you have this almost a persistent

689
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,819
identity takedown going on

690
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:34,349
and they also have a service called me
ask me which if sorted

691
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,099
do you guys know the concept Emery
Miller re: Miller is like I have a

692
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,349
server that I sent an email to an
observer strips all the identifying

693
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,039
information up some that under the

694
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,829
apart I wanted to go to and that's the
way that you can send an email without

695
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,390
haven't be traced back to you

696
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,440
and yes there is a burden to trust them
or email or its ok but but that's for

697
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,039
another

698
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,480
that's for another talk so mask to me is
something that works like arian Miller

699
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,260
except for credit card information

700
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,069
which I find very interesting so there
is it your resources and pass that

701
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:08,079
I i would say follow me on Twitter
Follow identity woman on Twitter she

702
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,630
tends to talk about the stuff a lot

703
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,130
there's not really any crack tip a
central core on that I know if you're

704
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,680
interested

705
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,538
in government this step there's the ID
ecosystem .org if you're interested Emma

706
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,680
your p.m. stop a non-american there's
Enis AVS organizational

707
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,640
well still this is a very new feel that
I don't know many people up

708
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,859
a whole lot of thought into a at so is
that useful the

709
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,770
I can expand on different parts of you
up but

710
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:43,259
to things and

711
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,420
how and where to yeah somebody else to
ask a question over

712
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,790
I was waiting for the pedofile question
ever came up up

713
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,940
August what's up

714
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,270
oh there you are

715
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:06,759
a fortuitous I just happen to think that
a question that and

716
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,910
dollar it happens to come at the same
time hi larry has gone

717
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,410
brocco

718
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:20,129
so I think going to some details on it
so many interesting cases the opener

719
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,840
discussed

720
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,260
in with people characters that oh yes so

721
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,840
Osama limit the three clash left to go
on about five minutes but

722
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,210
up one that i think is really
fascinating and this came up but when I

723
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,280
receptors ides cheap lottery

724
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,010
a few months back so a lot of discussion
right now about her career

725
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,010
as members online you think about script
kiddies anything cuz somebody is in here

726
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,090
at the World of Warcraft account things
like that

727
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,150
another email from somebody who I am

728
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,800
what is that his wife as Iranian
national

729
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,950
and she left me up nited States and
trying to get her to wear this

730
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,759
but ok at his wife is an Iranian

731
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,370
a shot she lives in the United States
and she can't use her legal name on

732
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,370
Google+

733
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,819
because if she doesn't she says
something about the Iranian government

734
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,540
doesn't like

735
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,750
because the green revolution that
happened a few years ago on Iran

736
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,820
well I read as an Islamic country and
they're very much energy and therefore

737
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,620
carrie Ann

738
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,009
her wife's family could be taken away
for

739
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,120
they could beat portrait fortin things
like that so these are the kinds of

740
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,710
things that often come up lol

741
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,310
what are the actual want when they want
the impetus is for

742
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:39,170
craft in the the on the vigil dot com
project and its policies that we're

743
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,330
trying to do

744
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,990
it's not but just so that i can text yes
say whatever I want it so that people

745
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,000
like her are able to express themselves

746
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,100
online with up here of harm comment to
themselves or their families

747
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,330
so I like the pedofile question that
comes up a lot

748
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,310
well and I've actually has asked me
directly at during summer these

749
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,610
conferences that have been to

750
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,650
with the government I covering people
directly SP dot dot

751
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,920
pseudonyms help empower pedophiles in my
responses

752
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,750
well yes but there's a lot of other
stuff powers but a files to let you know

753
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,390
driver outta bounds into its heroes

754
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,580
and on the pope's it you know that that
they've contrive in bed so we have to

755
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,480
battle past a

756
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,730
you just what the Rose Tyler Lockett so
it about 20 rows and I

757
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,210
the address above clouds with the band
clouds I'm okay with that one but

758
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,230
things like that ed on the flip side
though if your child is being stalked by

759
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,420
an online predator

760
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,020
your child can use susanna I'm to
protect themselves and when people hear

761
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,390
the

762
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:39,060
the 10 to come around pretty quickly and
it's just something interesting to think

763
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,020
about the last example that cover
because I'm actually running out of time

764
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,400
here

765
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,869
is if you if you think about it somebody
it

766
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,609
identity is also chronological so you
may have done something 10

767
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,930
years ago and you're very different
personnel and maybe it's just for

768
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,910
mistakes maybe your

769
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,190
doing your walk about your exploration
endured different now and should you be

770
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,070
held to the crimes in your cost or

771
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,590
if they worry about crime so there was I
don't remember her name but there was a

772
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,330
schoolteacher earlier this year

773
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,450
who was actually fired from her job in a
California school

774
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,740
because it turned out but several years
ago she was i

775
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,279
it was either stripper she worked
important evidence up this came out

776
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,930
was presented to the principal for
school district and she was then

777
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,649
acquired

778
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,570
so when you talk about separations
identity

779
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,670
a few other things like I should get the
ellsberg mas to get on a bus

780
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,530
you have one minute okay wanna show you
guys the ellsberg mass going to get on

781
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,680
with us you have

782
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,210
whistleblower texan and you have the
shield law something like that too

783
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,090
so the notion of separation a context
the notion is that

784
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,140
people might people besides a little
script kiddies hang out on the internet

785
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,060
made me this stuff is something I just

786
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,900
a try to get more people to think about
so with that i think im actually going

787
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,500
to conclude my talk thank you so much
too but not larry and well pick and I

788
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,560
are from a can

789
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,529
a possible for me to do this on
basically virtually from Oakland Calif

790
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,850
and please join them rights if you're
interested and the

791
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:05,779
I ramble on Twitter on a ates chichi I X
is my twitter name so if you are

792
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,460
unfortunate enough to follow me

793
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,900
you will see more information about
having to stop there so with that I

794
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,430
think I'm gonna wrap this up

795
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,569
and thank you guys SO much for allowing
me to do this
