00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,590
I E you by walking up to the device

156
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,730
I'll they're typically multi-protocol
meeting you see how was that are

157
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,540
on suka will also be enabled for ZZ way

158
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,300
and includes you and the wars in be on

159
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,329
not she like around three hundred
dollars sorry

160
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,950
'em but you know pretty cool style I'm
definitely

161
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,830
fun stuff happened if you're in the
wireless hacking

162
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,960
um the other in that space as even a
little more interesting

163
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,080
is I anesthesia be only yeah I'm

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,920
and using your device as I

165
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,329
as easy as as a 10 I'll or is it hard

166
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:20,989
is arms on vendors like HIV are only are
all for you

167
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,110
systems are major yes Diaz co.'s

168
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,000
where you were don't want your phone axe
as HID iCLASS

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,649
on the vicinity guard or building access
for songs that are using for the Euro

170
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,510
used to gain access to your office

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,610
you hold your phone up to the reader and
it verifies you

172
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,610
obvious once again this is this your
element in the card and their faces an

173
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,480
SD card be secure Roman

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,910
arm is verified against back in system
jobs all the other people and hotels are

175
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,199
doing this as well

176
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,949
the EM re: almost eight years has a car
based system right now it is we're going

177
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,920
to see contactless cards

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,170
on the hotel is also looking to do the
futures you go to the hotel

179
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,199
you jokin you don't have a wonderful
known

180
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,729
it will be provisioned your room he's
right he's your phone

181
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,540
a house that should be stored in a
secure element to it was to be done

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,420
in a secure manner but up regardless
provision your device and then you've

183
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,540
got your own you

184
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,719
by you to open your your room with your
own with your

185
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,520
own so that's as the girls being good
you know

186
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,420
tested at this point I don't know any
actual them implementations of it

187
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,620
but the

188
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,050
they are looking to do that I okay so

189
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,750
mobile devices I as you can see here
very probably figure your or

190
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,950
the I enjoying based devices on

191
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,250
iPhone still has not had although it's
been widely speculated that the iPhone 6

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,930
will have

193
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,290
always been as far as I know no
confirmation from Apple on their

194
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,719
on there was also speculation i believe
i won another

195
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,740
but your at this point I would imagine
that they would not leave this out the

196
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,580
next version

197
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,000
on has been the Nexus is the Nexus s

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,560
on soda or you yeah and I services the
Nexus S

199
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,290
on the first phone to have it was
actually a

200
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,160
Nokia phone mobile devices the personal
data CNS

201
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,370
other since then you can see that the
Nexus and Galaxy Nexus series

202
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,310
I for Galaxy series %uh all ahead
nfc-enabled

203
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,189
them um mostly up until now they were
using XP jumps s

204
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,140
on the the Nexus S and the NSBE

205
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,029
544 I believe in it and the Galaxy Nexus
Prime will invest phones for a

206
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,420
NRC hacking I'll be happy as five best
features a

207
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,479
home as all the s

208
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,440
for the Galaxy s4 um there she was also
using XP

209
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,190
and as the stack in the phones so it'd
be a really good then go

210
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,980
I was Samsung but for whatever reason as
a yes for now

211
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,860
they are using Broadcom energy chipset
and the secure element in the devices is

212
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,260
a

213
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,209
has grown from inside secure and there
was using insert your sassy use that now

214
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:10,839
too

215
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,980
so barely visible falling out there I

216
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,810
as you later what are the advantages
that i can text features a solo

217
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,410
you know

218
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,629
on a J I guess you could say in use like

219
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,220
an excuse my fear classic don't fully
implement the standards so you don't

220
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,379
have an excuse just sent you can read
those parts

221
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,480
okay so the standards involved

222
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,470
I we have II so I issue 44 43 A&B

223
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,990
I'll the mood the link doesn't seem to
have a NBA is the model is she a big

224
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:49,269
go to use I'll I will look in a minute
about you what's love

225
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,550
the radio communications expertise and
one parts standards but

226
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,889
um just sex as 319 as the jewelry
industry standard as fellow

227
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,399
on this types regardless down as Sony's

228
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,769
a standard personas product arm

229
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:12,069
I saw easy and ginger night zoo on that
photo is also known as an scid yes one

230
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,610
which focuses specifically on your
communication between two mobile device

231
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,399
so that the forms that the that part
standard

232
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,769
on and then we have a high so I C 15 693

233
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,180
I which is the standard prison guards
it's not really an Icee

234
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,000
up but it is no smiles as he descended
I'll

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,670
and is may need for access control
guards were at for building access

236
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,870
I these are got full support and he
enjoyed

237
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,910
on so it's 10 years as you know the the

238
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,750
standards in order to implement enjoyed
yeah he let her see any injury

239
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,630
as per on Google's standards for the
Android Open Source project you must

240
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,630
work Tennessee day up but the demanding
one shows that you have in your phone it

241
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,839
may or may not work with different types

242
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,860
courts up to fall into that space so

243
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,579
it does a lot are you can see there's a
lot of different standards involved

244
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:12,130
in Islam

245
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,430
vendors Jade all of them or not all of
them

246
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,900
and so there's there's not 20
interoperability that you would hope

247
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,530
so sometimes you absolutely are a crash
in as the weather

248
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,270
you know this is yeah he's got work with
your chips and someone's old were

249
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,370
on any way a little bit more about I so
44 43

250
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,520
I dash 1 as much by the physical
characteristics tennis shoes but as far

251
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,850
as the radio frequency power and signal

252
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,000
there's three Spurs flies initialization
it like collision

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,290
and then four which bus line with both
my the transmission protocol

254
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,680
now this is where is on offenders live
Insp with their my hair classic arm

255
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
it wasn't my girls let it leave on

256
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,189
divert from the standard and it is my

257
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,130
Glasson a.m. an XP I'll do it was you
who you are there or not

258
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,900
cryptographic exchange corporate don't 1
%uh

259
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,010
you know in house speaker now always
within secure right

260
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,430
that's lunch so that things been riddled
with bullet holes in the past love

261
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,650
five years them armies

262
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,270
0 pretty much uses is the NRC equivalent
of web

263
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,490
it's you know don't use it long Gollum

264
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,660
okay alright so I was as you work

265
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,490
as I see forces you the

266
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,830
30 miles for parts makers Ridge which is
the

267
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,590
powerfully high-frequency million army
is one of the RIT technologies that use

268
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,100
inductive coupling more seductive couple
on the gambling is

269
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,080
you reader generates a magnetic field
and then

270
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,410
thereby powers the tag with that
magnetic field

271
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,800
as a password and that's powered by the
%um powered by the reader

272
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,140
I and then the Jews and data back to

273
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,199
the me to me send data back to the
reader

274
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,290
%uh the tank modulates that field I and
thereby sans

275
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,879
the data that the for years requesting I
was able to just came to modulation by

276
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,070
and large anyway

277
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,760
arm from %ah the PC

278
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,190
big other busy is the payment personally
coupling device that's the reader

279
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,220
a pic is a proximity is greeted

280
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,680
to a deserted record for civilians
reserved archives gov

281
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,780
on and that is a card RM so does

282
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,399
to terminology up in a way for me to
your party uses a modified Miller going

283
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,410
to modulate dollars and so no-one is 100
percent disabled as euro is

284
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,530
like very much up the start of the
carrier you

285
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,520
um eighty I'm there's a educational and
a busy transmitting or six jobs please

286
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,690
modify Miller

287
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,700
100 percent bomb the

288
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,400
com pick you up the carnage a leader
rather uses are Manchester encoding

289
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,860
when I modified Miller I

290
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,370
at Walmart Juliet 10 percent and the
reason for that being that

291
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,290
I you know your obviously don't have a
lot of power

292
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,990
I when you're viewing the tag: be
powered by the reader

293
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,299
Obama's order to be Salam conservative
on that

294
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,150
you're only going so now one is a
hundred percent the signal

295
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,910
up and down 80 will be nine reserve the
signal

296
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,390
so um you get here he's drawn is very
easily and see it is using missiles go

297
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,770
ambrose I am however um

298
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,790
it's a lot easier to even from reader
jagger

299
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,020
that it is revealed yet to return
because of the way the the

300
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,580
up to the the wave for Los alright so
three modes of operation

301
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm reader/writer again the device

302
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,990
I your mobile device will act as a
reader and read a car

303
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,059
alright of your your your two devices

304
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,260
%uh it hit me yeah would be willing to
change data

305
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,309
and a scenario citizens or be more same
size as me but the devices back to back

306
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,350
and they are used to it as easy to boot
strap it on the Royals

307
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,230
Bluetooth or WiFi direct arm there's a
couple different

308
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,450
of range to use their your polling
request invalid response for NBC's than

309
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,260
the usual engine burst its place

310
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,290
%uh the reading devices movie bowling
bus

311
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,790
and the other the the device being
renovatable in response

312
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,750
I'll never do that transport frame is
used on the brain is pretty much the

313
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,799
freeway I'm hoping to say no

314
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,820
I leave it all to you soon will begin
with a header off of 48 minutes mansions

315
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,040
records euros

316
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,159
bomb there's two mos their active and
passive

317
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,220
activity is both devices will actually
take turns

318
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,799
on is yeah

319
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,860
acting as the the reader if you will

320
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,299
mom where it has to be is the

321
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,970
where the their wealth generated signal
take turns are a musical

322
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,510
passages one device generates a signal
the other device

323
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,710
are modulates alright had acting as if
it was a tad

324
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,710
more or less on and then we have a card
emulation which I said the

325
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,870
more than twice behaves as cards up arms
we would not want to waste

326
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,590
needed to be done with the secure
element on where the secure element

327
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,418
itself

328
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,210
axe as the quarters privileges to pass
through right through

329
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,710
the content was formed and which is the
year the NFC chip

330
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,389
straight to the secure element and it
will interact with

331
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:38,189
the core router directly are more you
can use

332
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,860
%uh was known as host go relations
offered articulation

333
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,158
on this will be done if you don't have
access to the secure element we don't

334
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,919
have one

335
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,570
and in this case you're your application
processor

336
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,539
will talk directly to the reader and
basically you'll be

337
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,929
doing this in software release of where
popcorn English

338
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,610
through an app right on so I'm not
nearly obvious

339
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,908
you're busy everywhere safe world growth
but your keys

340
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,769
ombre if you don't have control over
your secure element

341
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,929
like we must follow you won't have
because

342
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,269
as you carriers pretty much control most
love the way you can use your own good

343
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:21,809
but it's a good way to use be milling
around there

344
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,149
alright who

345
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:28,639
hoop I'm so I'll little bit about you
know how

346
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:34,449
energy transfers data I am when the ways
it does is 0.2 mi wages and yes which is

347
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,269
the energy exchange format

348
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,169
and what you have years old and deaf
message it's basically just doesn't work

349
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,580
protocol as it is a standard of the
castle Eden data

350
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,289
so your def message in that you'll have

351
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,649
one or more and yes records and does
give you boners are several different

352
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,719
types can be there you are I'm

353
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,629
are taxed different minds lives were
handover parameters

354
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:02,248
for another kind of connections your
Bluetooth wifi direct

355
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:07,639
mom and that incited the the end of
record at the end of payload and that is

356
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:08,039
your

357
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,249
actual payload is your actual data
Friday where

358
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:14,499
so the light up here more or less

359
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,859
all the buttons were this is a okay

360
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:22,029
so here we are on this message in that
we have one or more and F records by the

361
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:23,070
way you know as many and a

362
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,269
records as you want very much though top
and other

363
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:30,029
I inside asia the records on a header
and payload

364
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,730
and then you have the type name format
which denotes was

365
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,789
table data it is I am and then

366
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,720
the upwards of what table record rather
and then you have the ID which is

367
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,869
optional to use in the payload length

368
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:48,738
from this header here in the rivers and
that record and retention that we talk

369
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:49,039
about

370
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,639
enjoy does range or use the figure out
what kind of an apple launched on your

371
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,158
phone

372
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,519
read the first one and figures %uh net

373
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,940
are more or less

374
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,470
what you know and you should we should
be using for this will talk about this

375
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,269
okay servers repair no I'm so well

376
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:12,950
the a record drives on used to be a part
of you would be a smart poster be taxed

377
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,869
your eye or different hand over her

appears all but i cnt injured because it
is probably the most significant

394
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,560
implementation and has the most support
by the way if you want to find out a lot

395
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,669
well and Tennessee the enjoy Developer's
Guide

Tuesday and everything that's

399
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,350
you know is rooted in the way that the
code is laid out in such so

400
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,590
and they're very mister so anyway
mandatory on his way to see the vices

401
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,560
are you human

402
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,260

for certainty I'm not sure about others
like you don't know

411
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,449
here's a guide are related to resolve it
is is fully implemented as I enjoyed

412
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,550
um anyway so optional

413
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,889
is um %uh NXP's my fear cars

414
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,920
arms alone or with which are more SC
compliant and others

415
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,500
resistance the and my for classic cars

416
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,560
as I said if you're not interested in
Jersey

417
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,419
you're not going to be able to read on

418
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,510
up which is a proprietary an a/c from

419
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,970
XD technology rather than he does
standards-based

00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,540
I Madrid Rd I'll are

421
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,010
so yea that's good largest saying about
the records is

422
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,430
so weary jag with enjoy the mice

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,460
for Jack technology because you lightly
losing any other

445
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,970
app is a was registered animals so what
now feeling that you

456
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,750
and also whether they're like rewrite
gable more

457
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,160
and whether you can configure them as
read only or the configured by the

458
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,910
manufacturer as being like read-only or
reading rewrite

459
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,740
CNG might want to use it good figures
read-only

460
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,810
well take three and four are configured
by the manufacturer

461

as a GTR arm literature

469
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,750

499
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,449
um there's also a decision instead

500

sowwy things are right

505
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,440
June defines a the bottom layer

506
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,130
get to use was visible liar he will um

507
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,870
the logical link control your goal you
with this is like the data link

508
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,059
protocol:

509
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,190
layer hey is a daily brawl arlington's
now that you didn't have the symbol &

510
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,580
exchange: more goals is a
standards-based

511
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,408
horrible or us on android devices not
know was

512
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:42,019
lies just below arm you will have

513
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,259
others already ended wish for a college
is an injury specific protocol

514
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,159
arm is a lot more simple and lightweight
did not but those are the features that

515
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,200
a snap has on as I'll

516
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,809
I jelly bean or I did I i sorry ICS

517
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,070
and going forward on they also want do
they

518
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,470
they gave a Enrique did with us as well

519
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,629
so LCB um the lot where to go to call

520
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:12,779
on and and and and and that goes for
goal or snap

521
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:16,039
will were right on top of it the actual
data exchange

522
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,408
and what those lips changes the INS I

523
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,279
messages arm is designed to slaves GOP
nationalists for connection-oriented

524
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,570
so connections will be used here arm

525
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,749
the higher here layer protocol in use

526
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,710
arm does it owner a reliable delivery

527
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,340
right in which case you don't need to
reliable delivery it too low

528
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,389
layers right so in that case you don't
need to use use that but

529
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:46,459
you have a letter for gold is not in its
own a

530
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,070
reliable delivery I'll LCBO offers that

531
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,678
that functionality I it does it look by
a arm

532
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,740
a a up a sliding window

533
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,019
almost like you have a g'day on

534
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,580
so I the I am

535

the the payload at-risk EU's

536
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:13,369
a run that argues others brains and you
will emerge sample through wifi fields

537
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:13,908
and

538
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,289
you will see with line and DVDs that
saving

539
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:21,629
its there are only like 45 feels and as
just I'll

540
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:25,498
the destinations honors I axis pledged

541
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:31,220
which is as usual it up or right are
basically well CBS's opens up the sake

542
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,980
I am lessons so you have your
destination service access point which

543
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,769
is the address was going to

544
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,570
you have the EU tonight was what kind of
message

545
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,659
is right armies it a hasn't messaged is
it does get that message

546
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,790
is it a an observer's discovery message
asking asking me

547
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,399
destination by so God them

548
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,000
services you know it all those arm

549
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,920
you have the source service access point
is the source address

550
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,580
other sequence number which is used for
reliable delivery

551
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,049
and the actual information SVCs on

552
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,640
and another for all right I'm not but
not just not reading the revised like

553
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,489
on the obvious change for all job it was
easy use without you just delete

554
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,899
or ID I'll so

555
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,070
liberals why don't I love you are ready
to use the end that was both holes and

556
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,960
Wednesday off base protocol

557
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,470
classes days argues up and chill I
enjoyed 3.2

558
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,870
I am very much it's very simple
basically

559
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,710
I'll in order to you could warm you
their standard

560
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,170
I have to run a server each slice that
was as worser

561
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,670
and bass you to play connect to the
server connects it says the NBB Hatter

562
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,780
almost basically as a the version number
and then what kind of data to follow

563
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,330
honors NBA the end and we had a really
and adventures that this tax

564
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,440
advantages of bush your explore all a
one-way Bush

565
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,180
arms that is all there is is more my
actual your call

566
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,370
and its reinsurers the end get and what
messages

567
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,509
I also supports fragmentation

568
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,460
so you can right man larger on the
Muslim

569
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,120
on here uses

570
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,160
the Hells Gate a lot withdrawal the

571
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,310
lawyers who were all uses the actual
religions were

572
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,360
to rival dealers doesn't resolve this
case

573
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,080
else you would use lab worry on by the
following yes higher

574
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,480
and again use your leaves a complex
field on

575
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,330
brain the phrase under the same 'em your
request and response rates

576
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,390

about all those looking to

577
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,890
that you have what your request or
response to the nose which is

578
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,700

579
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,750
is not very high demand with I forgot
protocol

580
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,880
sold as the others lying around these
four goals

581
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,950

00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:25,839
and yeah I do exactly this for a long
before I do that

759
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,200
I yeah I'll

760
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,259
budget but yeah I love rather you

Lucy a I

764
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,290
alright so on little more on hardware

765
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:53,390
arms all chipsets against the five
batters was in my Galaxy Nexus

766
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,100
one on lab um it is I am

767
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,610
it reminds edits radio which is a unit
512 slash

768
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:07,120
yes great radio contact was friend I
easy the microcontroller Jones

769
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,580
runs in right arm and then I'll

770
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,350
it has a a built-in smartass jet

771
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,900
operas your elements I am getting
together today judy 7 guard overseeing a

Zen garden are more bese garth

778
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,060
three ways to do it and the wastewater
the SD cards and go out the back

779
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,830
way anyways using a wire on the ways of
your head

780
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,770
you're out when it is used STC which is
also zest wired

781
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,890
as you know you are alright so

782
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,210
um you little layouts at work here

783
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,800
so the I am the BN 5

784
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,420
44 ulcer your best years he had gone
back to sleep well as the Sgts

785
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,470
DJ here with the got that was runnin

786
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:14,189
alright hanging off the side here uses
more next year

787
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:18,100
which is the years your own it right I
you had our

788
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,140
where you have a microcontroller here
and then

789
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,370
all this right here I am is

790
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,460
known as the the end the whether it was
only

791
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,550
OMW warehouse arm

792
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,590
all this right here minus the

793
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,950
menace eurozone is to be had by were
born at chip that it was like an excess

794
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,470
armed and wanna though the only
difference is we will be on biodiversity

795
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,419
by hand and

796
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,500
did you buy it for you or is that this
but as an embedded

797
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,950
as bill initially bill in last Roman we
have here

798
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,569
as a liar I is the only saw

799
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,240
culinary arts and why is a universal
years marxism or

800
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,939
so you have is your own little world in
the form factor prison guard

801
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,570
you do your single are there the AC on
your laurels

802
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,660
dollar-based that the interface back to
your application processor

803
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,379
that way back there fish processor
lashes elysees version that Apple

804
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,860
NC I that the

805
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,880
as she does and is on a mission came up
with it

806
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,250
lose their lives it um remember the
enzyme involved in black and white a

807
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:27,700
minute

808
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,870
so it's very much on the layout I am so
I

809
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,259
sure owners and the general is your
language or

810
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,220
I'm on who will actually saw them if you
are trying to access a million Iraqis

811
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,200
many times

812
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,509
it will just stop let you where you need
to have the right gate

813
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,670
I'll so he is you

814
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:55,470
you know you me sir are you lies with
the only reason he's a challenge all why

815
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,180
was I was

816
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,600
a service managers I'm they are
intermediary

817
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,020
eight million eighty lady hey I'm
actually really do but they make a lot

818
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,750
of money

819
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,300
engineered to manage the carriers
manufacturers

820
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,750
and every loose ball mold an estimated
old he is

821
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,280
to the National Ice least we if um

822
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,670
8 May your big day must you I am

823
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,800
a moment and after that we realize the
home

824
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,300
0 minutes or just he's already numbers
they would usually you're doing them and

825
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,690
manufacture and

826
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,950
the mobile carriers I'm so

827
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,520
size is a you don't have that use yours

828
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:42,680
your own re: the who's going to resolve
other carriers on the bed in one and the

829
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:48,700
what it is and our arms at the st. Garza
not to like ours ours even less muscles

830
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,649
in the coming out

831
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,480
guy I miss the horse so you I'm um

832
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:59,090
do you manage your own some rest easy
guys busy with classes wired israel's

833
00:51:59,090 --> 00:51:59,880
midday ish

834
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,510
his of up of all wired

835
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,880
where on after all get you to create
record is your own

836
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,320
obviously we're gonna happen what's
yours sorts

837
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,270
he securely rush army to do that and
that virtually virtually does pass

838
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:16,880
through

839
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,300
other slant

840
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,970
and the on sure all is lost records and
dormir

841
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,089
the reason this disease

842
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:28,350
they only these own stash annually
according to willie

843
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,610
so an excuse more X it's only be

844
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,130
my your 1k my your four day an unusual
because well

845
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,360
so you probably have more completely
unrelated or

846
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,750
as be be your your

847
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,540
a Asia

848
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,740
okay so um Gordon goes

849
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:55,830
so you I see arms believes in God
promises a car is a car that made it

850
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,360
through yahoo Shropshire

851
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,380
J baseband processor delivered

852
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,090
feel I'll you haven't already deliveries
leverages

853
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,160
busy demands for writer and journalist

854
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,540
Islanders actors the come see frazier do
get ashy

855

a.m. the White is more cardio I the
status do it

856

however Solaris already in use be able
to get to it

857
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,860
in the golan always our proprietary is
only a rather go to them because they

00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,650
might work a is the the be as far as
built-in

866
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:57,150
up is or mixture on these journalists
delete these were measure

867
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,470
over to go anyway uses as always Java
for OS

868
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,770
oh and then to the ash interface is
standard zoom

869
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,780
um it's all rules usually

870
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,970
hapless political on me

871
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,250
um on is your own it army is

872
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,790
the dollar buy it was not at all what
your core measure

873
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,130
at low levels settlers at all by Visa

874
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,300
an hour so if an entity with a
controller for the

875
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,850
the standardized to the they did you see
it as you know you do that because

876
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,390
each individual athletes that's your own
use

877
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,609
its own entity create a day after the
senator right

878
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,830
using be really should I want to make
america when I'm on Google

879
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,870
Google +1 from Chase right and making

880
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,370
they are never the twain shall meet
that's not what's happening right now

881
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,839
because the carriers

882
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,790
result jealously guard these days but
that's what should happen

883
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,430
I'm our guys live SAT are talking about

884
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,580
open source you are ever going to see
most the xylem

885
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,870
muslims ruled that you encounter will be
written I'm using this library

886
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,529
um what will these about a Jew is that
it also has a lot like great yeah

887
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,120
usually so I can call the Latics you
just like se-r

888
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,540
live chat at all times you'll come up
with all these utilities

889
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,058
emulating gore's reading different types
accords writing boards right when I

890
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:23,329
you some really cool stuff there on
death is something you're going to want

891
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:23,859
help

892
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:27,709
already it was written by the pound
laurie is it the same thing if they

893
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:28,739
survive on

894
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,969
a strippers for interacting with um or
Freddie garth

895
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:37,799
not just that but Arsenal regards as
well only it were to live in SE and GCSE

896
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:40,319
and will allow you to select which one
you're using

897
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:44,890
on so I would highly recommend their you
can find that on Cali like typing

898
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,799
reheated and the jam

899
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,849
couple times and show you reminders and
read my full

900
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:54,130
on something a little flaky but by and
large

901
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,789
they work pretty well Okies where we're
going to actual going

902
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:03,579
Charlie Miller um about 16 points
possible release rather in SC

903
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:07,969
comedies that the Matlacha a couple
years ago he also found a way to give LR

904
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:12,449
deliver exploits over an assistant to
the Vice compromises I N double your

905
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:13,999
labs did the same

906
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:18,160
on the issues do exploits want to
compromise the wise and other yet but

907
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,098
one game this last is the wise

908
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:24,339
and the other two were operable just
elation callers done all kinds of

909
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,288
different stuff I'll just take a look at
this site

910
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:30,289
the rosenberg on a bus buffer overflows
the legs as each day

911
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:33,579
we found it was the NCRI portion of it

915
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:44,569
a real nasty buffer overflows

916
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:48,509
um so white-haired shuffle holes

917
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:51,769
on the dark side jack is the most
prominent among them but there were many

918
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:52,959
others as well

919
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:56,319

988
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,319
with this that with his arm

989
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,790
this standard on PLO best schools usual
really all issues with

990
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:57,220
the areas I love you okay reader I have
one man was

991
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:02,000
Britain our reporters Press on a was
really cool was very cheap and you can

992
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,270
you use this on a laptop the view people
like you and me

993
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,680
re going makes for a great demo if you
lose power

994
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,560
are so real fast my fair because I don't
want to know that I'm here

995
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,660
um so live here and hopefully XP

996
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:21,500
it uses oMG also is almost as the white
other sizes run that was real that

997
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,240
my for classic arm uses are the group
the one algorithm

998
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,359
was urge shuffle all kinds of polls
terrible writer Greg though

999
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,160
over on the ultralight uses no good
though at all

1000
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,580
as the ones I best also like to see
implemented on Journal there's

1001
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:43,299
um my fear plus the 80 S 120 a drop in
the roadways

1002
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,650
out my other classic founded as liars
dribbled as though this was

1003
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,640
oMG reviewed by a site chill on how r
Nelson today

1004
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,930
in 2011 solvable and it was cool on the
deaths were you the one that uses

1005
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,470
a slightly and then we have this
morning's Israel resort about

1006
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:05,890
on so much for classes so really widely
implemented by villagers were driven

1007
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,609
systems

1008
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:10,030
okay this one that they were you not
supposed to use um

1009
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,260
so its standards compliant I support you
443

1010
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,960
that's hot later work early riser we
were ice forming over three years for me

1011
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,760
he used the one occurred 01 as long as
brothers

1012
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,840
over there isn't it so the way it's laid
out his your sis invites members ok

1013
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,920
because you have a budget

1014
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,050
Las ahh the sector's yeah

1015
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:34,710
%uh in a my fear class 1j you have 64
seconds

1016
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,770
each sector has four blocks it H block
this is my first memory

1017
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:44,330
YouTube video blog which has data user
access control system

1018
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,430
or value block I was using it like let
dry

1019
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:52,529
well walls guide the last blog each
sector

1020
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:58,620
um is a you have juju 48 veggies and for
access control best

1021
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,430
arm and then each sectors injured finger
it was OJ

1022
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,520
the very first lot of the very first
sector

1023
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,960
is the manufacture walk and negligence
the UI day

1024
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,720
along and then you have these different
vocal commands to the memory and their

1025
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,640
you may see you do things like read are
based on your access control

1026
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,740
you're allowed to do read/write decker
meant eight-minute store or transfer

1027
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,060
um between his Las is laid out like this

1028
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,850
so we have on sector year 01 Julia

1029
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:32,810
16 solicits the love them if you notice
each fourth block

1030
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:36,220
in the sectors or losses after as GA

1031
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,339
GB therefore you have it GE's and then
you have

1032
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,400
for existing job is actually three um

1033
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,250
and then there's one on use bit right
comment on the very first

1034
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:50,570
block a very researchers manufactured
lot which contains the you want your ID

1035
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:54,100
which the UDID the guard um and um

1036
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,920
some other information as well alright
so these he is here

1037
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,120
I'm should you know in a

1038
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,310
in theory you know you don't want you
would be using unique

1039
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:08,610
he is reached %uh sector or will not be
using the forties there are a number of

1040
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,240
the fall

1041
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,879
he's out there all the list in vacuo
that were implemented

1042
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,250
I and as you'll see that one way to
attack the guards okay so we'll become

1043
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,000
wiser doesn't bother to gauge

1044
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,580
on the reader so this is the only
allowed it is the the rear the Jag both

1045
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,830
want to make sure that each other no ZG

1046
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:28,890
don't trust each other right so the
reader makes a request

1047
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,890
%uh Angela Chang so they want to worry
you

1048
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:35,060
the jack generates random nonsense and
to the rear

1049
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,250
the reader generates go nuts and it also
impressed the nonce the Jackson

1050
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,630
says back then birdied a nonce and its
old

1051
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,460
the janky deedrick's the readers nonce

1052
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,620
and now does that the reader as the gay
increase the readers danse

1053
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:56,680
on Wed is okay with that he has it sends
it back to the rear

1054
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,509
the reader then the group then and now
he knows a good

1055
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:02,550
magaji so that most notably Chatterjee

1056
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,830
is a high locker the one works so

1057
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:09,029
was it good 2010 you did was because in
real time

1058
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,710
on disraeli law and should be easy to
read a number

1059
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,110
number generator only uses lost steam
baths are exhibited

1060

01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:35,040
are usually leaders rather um it Rangers
known how are your messages in cryptids

1064
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,860
even only they stacked their

1065
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:41,420
and the parity bit and the first bit the
next play next play or a great deal with

1066
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,260
Zeek

1067
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:47,470

news weaknesses I for like 30 users %ah

1068
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,580
best generated history so that

1069
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,020

1073
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,970
I'd also there's a implementation
weakness

1074
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,939
where a lot of organizations where
though maybe use the first like few

1075
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,980

1142
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,930
%uh before I leader was

1143
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:20,610
else maybe the samson was I while others
only

1144
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:26,630
bears' bias I'll way

1145
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,070
yeah for back right now not known %uh

1146
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,210
first 10 I'll known as the ESN

1147
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:36,770
the now's I find out real you know so

1148
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:41,740
10 is usually really is a lot of obvious
to a search for

1149
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,460
I'll AG one and it's just that who have
won

1150
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,680
they're really either there the very
much very good

1151
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,710
you figure out what you have so um

1152
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:57,150
your wallet one other things that we
will do some research I would be and I

1153
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,299
plan to do is

1154
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,420
look into um how are the Secure Element
Spanish

1155
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,900
you know howard hughes be manage how
he's doing I was she's been transferred

1156
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,889
or your taxes

1157
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:11,140
he says right is noticeably he's being
transferred

1158
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:15,770
and managed or get access to the actual
cards up right does Laura max is up

1159
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,020
like you know I was ices are an
authorized end

1160
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:23,490
and Google handles Google and she
doesn't use a bruised around anymore

1161
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:28,690
because also that went down horizon
numbers rise in the masts your own

1162
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:33,110
so would rule that now is they actually
used 80

1163
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:37,580
used your own anymore they use in their
use your credit card number the users

1164
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,730
like falling below the master card
number

1165
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,900
they all you they all have no the I
every Mon

1166
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,139
I'll and and a chance left earlier %uh

1167
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,220
realizes validate you identifying
information to contact your

1168
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,460
no on the back then and verifies it's
you and then we'll then

1169
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,640
your day with your actual account
details

1170
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,580
well they do that so apparently so they
could just do it all software

1171
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,980
his or her car

1172
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:06,830
Asian and get around the fact that
carriers you know agency right to draw a

1173
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,290
lot about phones right

1174
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,180
home but then the carriers actual as far
as do

1175
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:16,470
block the this is Leslie law laugh on
their phones

1176
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:20,030
are versatile out on the phone and allow
free download from

1177
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:25,139
play market and then WRC probably round
out my site loading on phones

1178
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,080
but then the ashes change the code so
that you sideload yeah it was a busy and

1179
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,120
cannot be won

1180
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,410
US yet make modifications to the I'll

1181
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,920
firmware running on the device arc in
order to be able to do

1182
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,739
I'm do you utilize who all your phone so
I see this is far beyond what a normal

1183
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:46,910
want what user will do right the hackers
W

1184
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:49,970
do that because miss you i cant not
allowed to do that

1185
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,660
well screw you know death you know you
know but yeah

1186
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,670
they're really like with their really
like going above and beyond to be able

1187
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:58,140
to keep

1188
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,010
wallet out there because the writers of
our time rolling out my sis

1189
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,210
all good things over long and early I
years

1190
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,810
dawn um that the you know they've been

1191
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:13,710
holy law school all this time it has
hurt Google Wallet I

1192
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:17,520
overall it is hurtful payments so this
is a result ish

1193
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,040
approach um is really set mobile
payments back to the US

1194
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,160
not really if you didn't have this is
worthy

1195
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,620
it I i really feel who had not been
prevented from an axe

1196
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,040
your own rises Asian utilizes on

1197
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,930

up all patients being you know

1198
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,630

are right now I'll

1199
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:43,600
as a result no not universes

1200
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,750
I'm that you guys
