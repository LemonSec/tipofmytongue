1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:12,879
pretty acceptable so welcome everyone

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:14,500
golf gang Roberts these pirates whatever

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:18,310
you want to call yourselves these things

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,170
try to stay gender-neutral but otherwise

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,880
thanks for joining me thanks for coming

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,009
out and seeing this little shadow Rooney

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,820
let's talk just walk about whatever we

8
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,759
want to call it these days this is the

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,579
kind of introduction to my talk tomorrow

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,910
as well called not so secure software

11
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:39,850
factories that's where I'll be actually

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,589
digging into something and taking the

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,399
parts and all this other fun stuff but

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,160
today this is an introductory course

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,960
this is gonna sue no knowledge of

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,428
software development containers DevOps

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,929
like if somebody asks you to make an app

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:04,030
right now you'd have quandary right so

19
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:07,540
preliminary information kind of set the

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,960
tone what is DevOps what is that dev sec

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,610
ops security yes is the thought of

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,529
including security in the forefront of

23
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,850
DevOps we've been doing DevOps for

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,240
decades now

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,640
people don't get clerical about it but

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,369
now we've found out that these CICE

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,930
platforms and pipelines and automation

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,060
engines and all these other functions

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,560
that we've built into each other don't

30
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,930
have security at all and not even the

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,130
best of money so it works so we're

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:42,550
finding a lot of exploits and software

33
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,009
supply chain issues that we wouldn't

34
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,390
have really thought of you know a couple

35
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,190
of years ago and this is something that

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,670
actually other industries have had to

37
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,880
deal with for decades right in

38
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,480
distribution and large machining

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,509
practices the supply chain is absolutely

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,160
crucial right you don't want to get an

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,070
Intel chip that's not an actually an

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,579
Intel chip and they do make off-brand

43
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,900
fake third-party chips so

44
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,760
putting that in your laptop you're

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,170
trying to sell that's an important thing

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,019
to have now we're having that issue with

47
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,489
supply chains in software and how it's

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,690
being delivered as well not just how

49
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,780
it's being built that how it's being

50
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,730
deployed and how it's being used and

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,120
that's a little bit more in-depth

52
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,670
tomorrow we'll go into the onion light

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,100
layers of container security and a

54
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:41,380
couple other bits but yeah this is

55
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:44,670
precursory sort of bits here now someone

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,690
said that software is eating the world

57
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:52,989
I'm really surprised that's working on

58
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:56,530
my hot spot don't use any Wi-Fi in any

59
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,060
conventional don't use that anyway what

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,680
software is eating the world right

61
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,260
everybody interactive software mostly

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,240
right now through apps usually through

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,890
your primary device there phone nowadays

64
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,480
that's weird thing to think but that's

65
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,250
usually most people for primary devices

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,920
so we see a lot of these apps we see

67
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,860
lots apps for X I just got this watch I

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,690
download three apps to users watch

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,930
absolutely insane right this is smart

70
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,480
home I have teach as a few years ago did

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,670
a smart things stuff before they are

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,440
acquired by Samsung which is cool

73
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,790
because we're things have two apps and

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,590
Samsung button so they made their own

75
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,510
versions of those centers of course so

76
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,459
then I have four apps on my phone just

77
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,049
for that little ecosystem not to mention

78
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,670
the other dozen apps I had to run my

79
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,890
smart home enterprise right you know say

80
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,850
I've come gotten out of that but IOT

81
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:48,549
devices have not stopped becoming more

82
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,920
prevalent right you heard about the

83
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,810
other nuts you know smart connected now

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,760
LG's got one and it can send you a text

85
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,530
when it thinks that it's been on for too

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,720
long right like if you forgot it on here

87
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,860
away from the house but it's not smart

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:07,030
enough to turn itself off okay cool this

89
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:10,000
is smart stuff right now we've got you

90
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,040
know smart infrastructure as well okay

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,040
so anybody know where what this is

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,780
no Oak Ridge is a little bit longer than

93
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:24,949
color that's a cool little spot weird

94
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:30,460
people but this is actually knits hands

95
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:35,330
I probably butchered that name Iran Iran

96
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,380
this is a nuclear station and it was hit

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,080
with something that you probably have

98
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,940
heard of called Stuxnet right now

99
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,380
arguably that wasn't connected to

100
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,770
internet like a lot of these other smart

101
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:51,050
IOT devices but a software attack

102
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,909
crippled this nuclear safety okay

103
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,970
infrastructure right this is not even

104
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,350
going into the recent tax on Ukraine's

105
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,150
infrastructure and even locally we've

106
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,790
seen issues of power distribution

107
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,560
stations so now the smarts have started

108
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,050
to become sentient as well

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,900
we've got connected little smart classes

110
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,820
with 5g devices that can scan people's

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,229
faces very quickly identify all right

112
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,590
yeah you probably you're thinking I

113
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,919
guess we're not there that's that's

114
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,250
that's then it's not a problem

115
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,930
okay keep telling yourself you might

116
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,930
have heard about some of the you know

117
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,260
stockade jumping issues that they've had

118
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,729
New York MTA well now they're installing

119
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,260
some cameras with facial recognition

120
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:44,780
capabilities it is here we've had this

121
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,990
sort of technology kind of put in our

122
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,669
faces for years and now starting to

123
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:54,440
become more commonplace with advanced

124
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:56,450
software and we're just are we gonna

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,219
start chopping these off with hats off

126
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:05,289
to a become hey hopefully it's also

127
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,970
going to our defense all right

128
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,099
this is Nicholas shillings effort

129
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,120
deficit cops across the entire DoD

130
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,120
there's pretty impressive

131
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,520
not a lot of people have had some issue

132
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,840
with gitlab before about how they're

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,729
selling in Iceland I think is Isis

134
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,109
horrible and also the fun jazzy

135
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:29,060
there is some moral issue there but

136
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,290
surprise surprise every vendor you've

137
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,600
ever heard of is selling to the

138
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:37,390
government there are hundreds of vendors

139
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:40,310
in this software Factory you check that

140
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,990
it's actually pretty cool but what's

141
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,410
important about this is that it took the

142
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,410
DoD or ten years over a decade to get on

143
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,530
virtualization and they've stood up

144
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,960
kubernetes clusters in months that's the

145
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,090
kind of heat that we're feeling from

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,620
other actors okay that's on state level

147
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,330
so software really is starting to eat

148
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,500
work and my name is Ken Monty I'm here

149
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,120
to scare you and tell you everything's

150
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,040
still alright alright as everyone even

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,270
involves around security knows that our

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,310
role is kind of broken by hey it's

153
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:21,620
alright you can see my programs on

154
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,220
github you can see my posts on

155
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,130
Twitter otherwise during the day today I

156
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,220
work for for your software we are a

157
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,110
value-added reseller a lot of other bars

158
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,290
just move came around but we do love

159
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,830
extra fun stuff hands-on workshops

160
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,140
webinars consulting a lot of hands-on

161
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,780
engagement our enablement forces is what

162
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,300
kind of sets us apart we specialize with

163
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,679
public sector entities so we actually

164
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,730
work with Nicholas Schilling put

165
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,730
together that that SEC ops

166
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,570
we specialize in secure platforms DevOps

167
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:02,330
and des analytics which usually go

168
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,340
hand-in-hand pretty well my job as the

169
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,200
lead solution architect is put a lot of

170
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,419
these things together and mash them

171
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,000
until they work for our customers and

172
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,750
that's usually really fun and also

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,620
nerve-wracking at the same time but we

174
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,060
have got amazing capabilities in just a

175
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,660
couple

176
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,020
these softwares platforms up the years

177
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:30,000
and thinking back to whenever I did

178
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,460
qbasic like we've we've come a long way

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,630
right now I'm not setting irq settings

180
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:41,620
for my new sound blaster Cartman okay so

181
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:45,370
how did this happen how do we go from

182
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:51,420
such simplicity this is such a large

183
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:54,160
complex technologically evolved world

184
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,140
how is software eating the world in fact

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,930
well some people would say it's you know

186
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,689
these boots everybody's got these

187
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,260
software boot camps learn Django in 31

188
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,570
days and that's fine for its purpose if

189
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,390
I want to learn Django in 31 days cool

190
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,100
if your PHP program you want to learn

191
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,680
Django say one probably good there

192
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,850
doesn't do pretty alright but they're

193
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,859
missing a lot of fundamental so what

194
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,300
happens is that spit out people who know

195
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,570
Jenkins

196
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,719
nothing underlay nothing as far as how

197
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:29,100
to work with a source how to contribute

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,180
with the team and at work Enterprise

199
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,950
I've got friends who have done this

200
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,060
exact same thing and they've been stuck

201
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,850
because they can't really fit piece of

202
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,069
software practice but they are very

203
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,450
helpful they expose a lot of people and

204
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,330
they've actually gotten people a lot of

205
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,400
different good places another argument

206
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,040
is that the Internet is a lot more

207
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,610
available right there's a lot more

208
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,199
information out there on it too you

209
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,940
don't have to listen to dial tones wait

210
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,730
for things to load if you want to search

211
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,380
something I can okay google halo go by

212
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,959
and it gives it to me on this it's so

213
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,600
fast that's the Internet

214
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,449
that's a good argument to the I think

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,930
that you know computers now are just

216
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,070
kind of a little cool hopefully I keep

217
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,689
telling myself that I've been telling

218
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,740
myself that since I was a kid

219
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,580
but people agree

220
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,430
one of the other things that I think

221
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,530
really helps is that there's usually a

222
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,270
decent bit of money Mike's also cool

223
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,520
right lots of people like one you can

224
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,990
make a lot of money and that is again

225
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,439
cool and you can do it all from the

226
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,160
internet most important though that's

227
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,270
easy

228
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,040
oh my gosh it's so much easier now all

229
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,900
right like you want to build an app you

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,089
can build an app in a short amount of

231
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:55,240
time you can take a an idea go from

232
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,800
concept actual production money-making

233
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,520
business without writing a single line

234
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,319
of code now you do it all from there now

235
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,750
you can learn how to do it all on the

236
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,130
Internet and it's so easy all you got to

237
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,990
do is pay ten bucks a month of some

238
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,910
subscription service like Skillshare or

239
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,280
whatever they're Hawking online now and

240
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,260
you know max Academy and the udemy's and

241
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:19,209
all this other stuff cheap easy boom

242
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,980
easy it's all that means now all right

243
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,820
I think that's really how things have

244
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,850
kind of exploded one of the other things

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,620
that have kind of helped is we've kind

246
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,720
of gotten our ducks in a row over the

247
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:36,100
last couple of decades technology's

248
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,360
right not to say that there isn't lots

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,260
of innovation out there millions

250
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,750
millions funds projects but through

251
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,370
decades of learning practice which

252
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,320
standardized you've optimized them with

253
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,810
automating this is theme is gonna be

254
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,510
very important I operate threes and

255
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,869
you're gonna see a lot of a lot of car

256
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:59,920
factory references all right so one of

257
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:03,430
them is this amazing new tool all right

258
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,189
you can standardize on anybody done any

259
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,500
sort of car work a curiosity change a

260
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,230
tire even brakes whatever's is a simple

261
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,330
stuff right cool you can YouTube it and

262
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,740
learn right that's literally like if

263
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,080
there's some weird thing that goes on

264
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,550
with someone's brake so hold you to it

265
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,090
find out oh that's a pin I just got it

266
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,099
look like school gotta go buy that final

267
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,410
so if you do this enough you learn that

268
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,320
if you work on imports or domestic cars

269
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,140
you end up

270
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,640
different toolsets right soon enough

271
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,180
hopefully maybe you can standardize

272
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,560
themself but otherwise there's a

273
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,109
different form standardization right

274
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,619
like I have a bunch of tools at home and

275
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,700
they're all lime-green REO B's the

276
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,350
oneplus platform

277
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,850
I've standardized on their toolset and I

278
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,050
just plug in a battery in this and plug

279
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,370
in the battery listen then I've got

280
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,819
tools here and there and everywhere and

281
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,510
it's great all right I can do anything I

282
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,730
want

283
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:59,630
I've got saws I've never even used but I

284
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,220
can use them now if you are like me and

285
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,310
while all these lime-green little

286
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,380
components everywhere and don't work you

287
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,119
know you get into this little eye track

288
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,710
that did not scale that well but um

289
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,610
there are hundreds of different

290
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,210
open-source software libraries out there

291
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,860
that you can choose one as far as tools

292
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,840
but whenever you are thinking of tools

293
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,640
the only thing I will say whatever your

294
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,170
objective whatever your workflow

295
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:30,170
whatever your mission is check out open

296
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,719
source ok this should already be kind of

297
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,689
instilled with most of us but most arts

298
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,240
kind of keeps you away from locking

299
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,610
ask anyone who's had to deal with SAT on

300
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,990
Oracle Amazon had a party when they

301
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,350
switched off their last world full

302
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:48,140
circle that's how momentous it was that

303
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,360
is but whatever you do go to open source

304
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,939
models you do have that little gravity

305
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,970
being to migrate or do other things or

306
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,500
integrate in things that are just much

307
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,610
more capable than closed source

308
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,170
proprietary

309
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,090
this is a software you get this is the

310
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,979
only thing you ever get right so we've

311
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,900
standardized our tools we're

312
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:16,300
standardized on open source now we were

313
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:19,400
optimizing our processes optimizing is

314
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,699
pretty key because you can take a very

315
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,760
funky process that takes days and weeks

316
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,350
to mince with proper optimization ask

317
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,620
any C developer and they'll tell you

318
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,350
that much right Java as well who don't

319
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,779
talk to me about

320
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,130
but optimization is very important

321
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,519
because without that you can't properly

322
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,470
automate and we've been on mating for

323
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,329
decades too and we're getting a lot

324
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:47,459
better than just bash scripts which is

325
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:51,479
really nice so this is the trifecta

326
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:53,459
again without standardizing on set of

327
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,300
tools we can't optimize our workflows to

328
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,060
automate

329
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,589
does that make sense if you've got

330
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,420
eighteen different sort of platforms to

331
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,579
support eighteen different ways of doing

332
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,550
something your workflows are not gonna

333
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,649
be optimized your processes are not

334
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,209
going to be animated and even if you do

335
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:11,550
try to automate all your different

336
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,439
processes we're gonna spend more time

337
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,479
maintaining those automation workflows

338
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,980
then it gives you anything dying right

339
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,709
so now we're kind of getting into this

340
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,949
automation bit and I am here to kind of

341
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:28,138
the common thought that robots are gonna

342
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:30,029
take our jobs automation it's gonna

343
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,529
destroy the industry computers are just

344
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,439
gonna be bleeping and blooping and

345
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:37,019
that's humans are gone ten years twelve

346
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,399
years whatever you know IOC said we're

347
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,540
all gone it's just gonna be computers

348
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,230
but don't work

349
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:50,099
robots are actually our friends right so

350
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:54,779
automation is here to help you not to

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:57,959
replace you it if automation will be a

352
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:01,470
thing that sets us apart as far as the

353
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,540
actual ability to adapt human beings

354
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,920
supposedly have the inherent ability to

355
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,599
adapt right and automation is coming and

356
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,250
being able to use automation is

357
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,839
absolutely crucial think about the power

358
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,790
tools again right I got a screwdriver

359
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:20,750
here I told the build a deck I don't

360
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:25,740
want to build that deck you give me a

361
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,440
impact driver and a good drill oh I'll

362
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,519
build a deck

363
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,740
but you have to learn how to use that

364
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,889
tool right cuz if you don't you're gonna

365
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,329
poke your eye out so that's the

366
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,339
difference learn how to use the power

367
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,199
tool right so learn how to use robots

368
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,510
all right how to build these robots and

369
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,250
again we've been doing it for decades

370
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,010
we're doing building batch scripts and

371
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,500
Python scripts and Perl scripts for days

372
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,260
and days and days on that but that's

373
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,769
been usually secluded to a small subset

374
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,500
people right you have to know how to

375
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:02,519
program in those languages to actually

376
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:08,299
use those operational processes so we

377
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:11,010
have not really enjoyed automation as a

378
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:14,160
society it's because it's still kind of

379
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:17,400
hard in most cases if you are looking

380
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,740
into IOT smart home automation sort of

381
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,049
stuff on today I would really bother for

382
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,699
a little while because even if you do

383
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,369
try to automate all your things and tell

384
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,140
your Alexis to you know set your scenes

385
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,428
to this stack in the other it doesn't

386
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,100
really work out that well all the times

387
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,169
a lot of events miss it's really hokey

388
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,469
yeah I've spent a lot of time setting it

389
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,910
up

390
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,640
one thing breaks you have to start all

391
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:44,160
over again it's just okay all right it's

392
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,020
not simple now what is simple though I

393
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,220
think as far as automation and this is

394
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,240
one of the key takeaways if you're not

395
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,419
automating if you don't know an

396
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,740
automation platform I suggest ansible

397
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,230
because pretty much everybody can use it

398
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,429
all right there's chef and puppet and

399
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,690
the stack the other out there and a

400
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,150
couple other platforms and hey you could

401
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,240
just autumn you can automate with PHP if

402
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,480
you really want I've seen PHP shell

403
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,480
scripts

404
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:12,400
but blur automation

405
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,980
I think ansible is great because it's

406
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,169
extremely simple with the others you

407
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,210
have to learn Ruby or Python or some

408
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,840
other sort of subset actually really use

409
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,760
it now cool thing about ansible is that

410
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,168
you can read it from top to bottom it

411
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,970
just executes you could read what's

412
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,860
going on and pretty much anybody will

413
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,789
understand you I can give you a playbook

414
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,939
right now you'll be able to read it I

415
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,020
can give my CEO a playbook and you'll

416
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,059
generally understand what's going on

417
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,750
right as long as like tests are going on

418
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,370
you can use it for pretty much

419
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,070
everything not just application

420
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:51,879
deployment not just you know web servers

421
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,530
or whatever beacon ping endpoints it

422
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,940
might have heard Starbucks throughout

423
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,178
their entire enterprise to use ansible

424
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:03,809
who can automate their network tens of

425
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:06,460
thousands of notes that's pretty cool

426
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,649
you do with a lot of weird stuff I gave

427
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,690
a talk a couple years ago somewhere else

428
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,690
about automating my home network which

429
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,620
has dual Wang capabilities also the fun

430
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,210
stuff with a lambda fired function for

431
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,320
an Alexa skill so I could yell at my

432
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,250
echo and restart my network and just

433
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,428
whenever I felt like terrorizing my

434
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:30,730
girlfriend one other cool things about

435
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,620
ansible is that as agents that's really

436
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,370
important and secure enclaves like the

437
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,590
ones that I get to work around a

438
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,979
non-negotiable thing is putting an agent

439
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:44,080
on a box I mean I'm going to have a

440
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,940
piece of software running on all your

441
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,990
machines with root access okay like

442
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,230
that's not gonna happen

443
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:57,130
do you do that easily sometimes for

444
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,950
something but but it's agentless which

445
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,330
means that a can interact with API it

446
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,640
can interact with Windows machines

447
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:07,120
connect with your machines and all sorts

448
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,220
right very important a little bit more

449
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,229
secure that way too so what does it look

450
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:16,600
like right this is a ansible playbook

451
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:19,350
let's read this together install and

452
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,530
start Apache on what hosts all of them

453
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:26,199
for installing servers everywhere

454
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,908
variables anyone who's programmed done

455
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,360
automation you know that you need

456
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:34,809
variables in to modify your execution

457
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
right simple variables HTTP port max

458
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:41,740
clients no problem

459
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:45,100
remote user root talk about that tasks

460
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,110
we're install base you need package the

461
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,449
young module we're targeting the package

462
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:54,070
httpd we're ensuring that the latest

463
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,900
version is out there cool we write some

464
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,149
configuration file with a little

465
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,320
templating module we have a template

466
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,150
file it's gonna take some of these

467
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,290
variables and put it in there and then

468
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,290
we're gonna start the SERPs

469
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,090
it's pretty human readable that's pretty

470
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,330
easy understand and we can push this out

471
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,649
to thousands and thousands like that and

472
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,820
we can run it again and we run again

473
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,290
next week it's gonna make sure that

474
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,840
Apaches updated because it's gonna make

475
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:24,129
sure that the state is latest very cool

476
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,010
and this is Gamal I'm actually told that

477
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,740
it's not yet another markup language

478
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,770
something else it's like a recursive but

479
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:36,190
either way this should be you know

480
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,720
pretty simple and pretty easy overall

481
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,780
which again we're pushing that easy

482
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,409
button okay now if this looks familiar

483
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,190
to you then you're probably in the

484
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,809
DevOps

485
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,140
ecosystem because pretty much everything

486
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,490
is ya know that's right yes right if

487
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,530
you're doing any kubernetes you have fun

488
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,850
stuff that's all again I'm about to

489
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,629
change my fallacy animal engineer but

490
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,120
otherwise that's kind of where he goes

491
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,100
into our next a little bit with DevOps

492
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,250
even we're automating now we're going to

493
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,990
kind of keep optimizing all right and

494
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,200
this recursive cycle is kind of what's

495
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,820
kind of feed our system but before you

496
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,020
the box again this is cursory sort of

497
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,820
information what is DevOps who does

498
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,650
DevOps I hate that phrase but who does

499
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,899
DevOps in there

500
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,330
enterprise their team organization at

501
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,020
home last year I told you all to get

502
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,449
home labs

503
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:32,730
y'all got home labs yeah you're doing

504
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:35,280
DevOps in your home labs now right it's

505
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,320
good but um it's good we've got a couple

506
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,540
people who are doing what do you think

507
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,980
about them UPS if you sat through any

508
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:45,690
sort of you know presentation online a

509
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,820
little webinar something you you you

510
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,420
probably instantly think cloud uh

511
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:54,990
there's a cloud containers pipelines

512
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:58,130
pipelines and synergy synergy consider

513
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,040
your see interview vertical integration

514
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:05,670
customer experience huh all right

515
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,950
that's DevOps right yeah kind of that's

516
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,420
where this a chart of you know why did

517
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,380
that scale properly on that bar whether

518
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,270
this is this is where this ice chart of

519
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,910
tools comes back to the haunt us okay

520
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,430
right this is what people think when

521
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,080
they think them up sometimes which

522
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,430
there's a lot of DevOps you stuff here

523
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,770
but you don't need to focus on this okay

524
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:30,000
we boil the ocean and we render to the

525
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:31,860
salts what do we get everything Z animal

526
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,600
like I said earlier everything is code

527
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,129
if you don't work with get you need to

528
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,199
learn how to use get you don't have a

529
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:41,670
github account all I've got to say is

530
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,910
it's 2019 yo its 2019 if you don't have

531
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,910
a github account my boss has a github

532
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,710
account and he's he's a sale to do he

533
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:53,970
just stars all my repos I don't know why

534
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,310
but anyway DevOps a couple other core

535
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,170
tenets is at this point we've been on me

536
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,700
right we should I should have drilled

537
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,010
that into your head one of those bright

538
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,010
green Rio be join us we're automating

539
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,020
everything and with that we're trying to

540
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,090
automate the process automation so this

541
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,650
pushing to get that actually kicks off

542
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,090
another process that continuous

543
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,210
integration will help deliver an

544
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:19,110
application maybe later and then that

545
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,400
means that as we commit our application

546
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,899
should be released will if it's in a

547
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,620
pipeline that's continuously good-looker

548
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:28,000
right well we're pushing out

549
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,000
applications thousands of times

550
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,440
cool the push of a button that's that

551
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,720
must be marvelous good golly on your

552
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,550
Jenkins server but without monitoring

553
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,140
without seeing the logs where you're

554
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,030
failing without this rapid feedback

555
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,770
you're not gonna be able to figure out

556
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,110
what's going wrong when you move this

557
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,930
DevOps containers sort of life cycle bit

558
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,399
ah you need these logs and this feedback

559
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,020
to actually figure out what's going on

560
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,960
because you're not gonna SSH into these

561
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,200
containers okay you're not gonna go in

562
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,130
and fix boxes something's wrong in

563
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,410
execution you fix it and you rebuild

564
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,420
that's it you're not fixing hundreds of

565
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:11,620
boxes you're pushing out hundreds of new

566
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,090
images with your so cool stuff that is

567
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,800
DevOps when we've got this you know

568
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,939
synergy thing you know that's all the

569
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,040
fun stuff

570
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,880
and unfortunately for Moore's

571
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:25,300
organizations they can only do a couple

572
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,630
of these steps properly some Vulcan code

573
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,550
problem someone can operate properly

574
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,430
most of them cannot secure and test

575
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,050
properly gone in some large

576
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:41,200
organizations where they don't write the

577
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:43,840
tests and they're handling earth some

578
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:50,680
part of your large amount of expendable

579
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:53,980
income per month but either way that is

580
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:56,590
DevOps and before we think it's just you

581
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,820
know two people fighting yes the

582
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,990
developers and operators there's

583
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,210
actually a couple other folks in the

584
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:05,560
room they're trying to yell at you two

585
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:07,210
okay business is gonna business they

586
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,960
have tasks they've got objectives you

587
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,790
got to make that sprint security is

588
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,990
trying to make sure that you aren't

589
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:18,490
getting bleeding lis hands but somehow

590
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,470
you still roll out default long-ago

591
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,570
credentials developers well they're

592
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,490
doing whatever they're doing a lot of

593
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,370
these go programmers I don't understand

594
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,320
what's going on magic

595
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,449
and otherwise your operators are just

596
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,230
trying to keep the lights on make sure

597
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:40,720
that nothing breaks explosions so we've

598
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,610
got a couple different actors and

599
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,779
there's a little bit of war and

600
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:49,270
infighting usually right problem gonna

601
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:53,230
be developed or boil it down the

602
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,710
relationships are dumpster fire we need

603
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,720
to get better at working together go

604
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,270
well we've been relying on just throwing

605
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,860
things over the wall as the same goes

606
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,450
so it's developer I'm just gonna throw

607
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,110
my coat over the wall and hope it works

608
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,840
right operations is like I've got an

609
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,760
application here you go that Security's

610
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,990
like no that's still boiling out of the

611
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,570
pot what are you doing go back okay this

612
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,559
throwing over the wall practice doesn't

613
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:27,668
really work out that way we have these

614
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:30,720
troubles and we've had more troubles and

615
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:38,169
usually again if we boil things down

616
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:41,010
it's with software applications okay

617
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:45,580
so application delivery application

618
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:50,350
development application security is

619
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:53,289
extremely hard all right even if you're

620
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:56,379
going by best practices and this that

621
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,760
the other for a layman like me for

622
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,830
instance one time I had to set up a

623
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:06,399
Hadoop cluster ran a full analytic

624
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,210
pipeline great injustice sequel data

625
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,789
this that and the other

626
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:14,289
oops I got to go catch a flight I'm

627
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:16,809
heading to the airport I installed the

628
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:18,580
cluster with vendor instructions to the

629
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,200
end so I was like I guess alright I

630
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,080
guess it's good ready to roll

631
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,929
I'm saying a little TSA and I start

632
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,059
getting email messages from Amazon hey

633
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:32,169
we're noticing some unusual activity

634
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:33,570
from few of your nose I think okay

635
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,920
that's weird I just got

636
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:40,899
yeah probably when it was doing the data

637
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,960
stuff I get another message hey you

638
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,570
really need to cut that out

639
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,940
okay minute later I get another message

640
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:52,360
look Amazon threatening disconnected my

641
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:55,090
account lo and behold that duper cluster

642
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,530
I deployed was hacked within a few

643
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,740
minutes pretty impressive stuff right

644
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:07,090
there right now others you might have

645
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,920
heard default Mongo credentials Hadoop

646
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:13,470
systems in securely set up this

647
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,470
technique that actually has a lot of

648
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,470
issues in our day-to-day life now

649
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,530
because we are something so it's not

650
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:26,370
just oh my database is insecure can

651
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,660
actually affect other people's lives so

652
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,129
we standardized we optimized we've

653
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,660
automated this far we've got that going

654
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:36,309
by doing so we're a little bit more

655
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,350
secure so we're not doing all these

656
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,820
other different things

657
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,639
since we're optimizing our process we're

658
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,870
embedding DevOps that should be a

659
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,690
cultural thing that's again it's not

660
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,270
just technology and now that Rob's

661
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,130
automating we're we're getting better at

662
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,450
what we're doing we're we're not messing

663
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:58,179
up a lot of practices that go awry or

664
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:03,760
usually do the human error try to

665
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:06,550
eliminate the human error and you're

666
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:12,059
usually sitting better if I'm not

667
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:14,559
forgetting the turnoff telnet reason

668
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,350
because it's a base construct of all of

669
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,240
my pipelines then great I'm scanning

670
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:25,209
that great so we talked about containers

671
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,770
real quick you think that's gonna solve

672
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,210
our problems right there's an

673
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:33,870
application delivery with a software

674
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,870
development problems is DevOps thing

675
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:41,470
now it's kumbaya docker brought the

676
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:45,120
champagne developers and operators are

677
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:56,950
toasting and living the good life

678
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:58,719
who is messed with containers hands yeah

679
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,250
I mean containers are easing that's

680
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,720
actually one of the one of the key

681
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,580
points you just type it in a couple of

682
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,490
command here like oh that's cool that's

683
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,500
it's that cool is very important that's

684
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,520
very powerful that whatever you go oh

685
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,690
that's cool

686
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,250
think about what happens when the whole

687
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,560
room goes oh that's cool or for

688
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:19,510
organization goes well that's cool when

689
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,870
the whole country goes that's cool so if

690
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:26,080
you're not too familiar with containers

691
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,030
the core bit of containers is process

692
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,620
isolation all right so let's think about

693
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,629
back in the day when we were running

694
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,000
shared services on single hooks all

695
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,880
right we have these 1u pizza boxes and

696
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,190
you've had an old Hostgator DreamHost

697
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,160
whatever account back in late 90s and

698
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:44,710
it's all on one share host right

699
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,160
that was super fun because back then

700
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:51,730
when getting slash dotted was a thing

701
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,980
once I could take down hundreds okay so

702
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,900
the virtual machines came and became up

703
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,720
commonplace and then you got VPS is

704
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,430
instead quick little slivers of machines

705
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
and that way you know as long as the

706
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,290
hosts aren't over subscribed and also

707
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:10,360
there Jess I know that my environments

708
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:12,610
is kind of sassy and cactus thing so

709
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,790
that is going to keep my hardware my

710
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,649
resources to its own work part there is

711
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,620
though you've gotten a full new machine

712
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,060
you deployed as VPS is VM you choose

713
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,100
your operating system a whole new

714
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,610
operation boom you've got a whole new

715
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:30,129
kernel address space and everything with

716
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,979
containers against process isolation the

717
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,370
container host actually extends its

718
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,250
kernel into the container with an

719
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,659
overlay file system and its own

720
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,650
namespace and also the fun stuff that

721
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:46,000
are getting to tomorrow but with this

722
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:50,020
you have process isolations

723
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,910
you still have a little you know wall

724
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,389
garden around your application but

725
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,530
you're actually able to have

726
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,750
applications to deploy in a much more

727
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,060
dense environment so you're probably

728
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,160
thinking it's like wow well you said

729
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,090
it's more dense it's cool you get some

730
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,980
benefits from it

731
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,689
VMs are gone no not so much being still

732
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,740
have their place they're actually great

733
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,630
to move around

734
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,780
well not that great to move around but

735
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,910
you can you know in a succinct manner

736
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,879
and a whole configuration you can do

737
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:27,480
that also with a container it takes a

738
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:29,440
snapshot of that difft file system but

739
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,940
it's a little bit more versatile it's a

740
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,830
little bit more elastic you get that

741
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,050
elasticity from containers you don't get

742
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,790
that with virtual machines if I have to

743
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,399
scale up a virtual machine I'm going to

744
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:41,200
have to turn it off change the type and

745
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,830
scale back up the most hypervisor

746
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,270
environments all right see probably

747
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,919
thinking like wow this is container

748
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,600
stuff it's cool it's new you know not

749
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,090
too many people are doing that has must

750
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,280
be some hot jazz and they just

751
00:33:52,090 --> 00:34:00,010
introduced actually it's not again

752
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,660
process isolation filesystem isolation

753
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,050
namespace isolation a lot of these

754
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,240
functions have been in the Linux kernel

755
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,270
for decades it's just been very

756
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,960
difficult to make manual system calls ad

757
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:18,270
hoc in Mass to orchestrate the

758
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:22,540
deployment of an isolated function okay

759
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:24,190
and then a few years ago the whole

760
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,969
doctor thing happened now you've

761
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,730
probably heard it doctor made it kind of

762
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,669
explode a little bit right so and those

763
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:37,480
for a few years up until recently we've

764
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:44,430
had an explosion of activity in this

765
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:47,590
ecosystem why is that well it's easy

766
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:50,770
like you said you run a command docker

767
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,630
bill tag it with your tag and your run

768
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,630
you run your you run your container

769
00:34:52,630 --> 00:35:00,270
that's that's easy

770
00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:03,000
that's it you do that right yeah doing

771
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:06,540
containers now I might even be able to

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,750
call yourself doing demos so that's all

773
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:14,330
cute and crating fun what happens when

774
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:17,250
you have more than one container okay

775
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:20,270
well we can put a bash script together

776
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:25,500
I've been doing that for years

777
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:26,670
just inception automation I'm gonna

778
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,100
build a couple different containers no

779
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,540
problem and then we're gonna run it and

780
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,080
then we have to link it to each other

781
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,820
right

782
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:37,799
this containers again in this process

783
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:39,720
isolation so for some things that are

784
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,460
denied by default for others you can

785
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,930
move differently that's why a lot of

786
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,900
people are doing containers wrong and

787
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,460
securely but otherwise you specifically

788
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,250
have to build out these sort of

789
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,230
relationships so containers and DevOps

790
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,410
in mass is actually very very difficult

791
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,600
and I haven't seen anyone that's

792
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,410
mastered it really but it's still

793
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:06,390
offering a lot of powerful capabilities

794
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:10,310
all right so our next victim of

795
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,310
dissection is Cooper days

796
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,319
is a hot jazz as a few years ago before

797
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:21,630
I give my explanation anybody care to

798
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,630
give their opinion on what kubernetes is

799
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,900
it isn't really hot stuff so kubernetes

800
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,240
is a project by Google

801
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,930
are they open source was dog food for

802
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,990
about a decade

803
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:44,080
graham but kubernetes is and i'll read

804
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:47,290
this off the screen I think it's pretty

805
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:51,060
succinct an open source system for

806
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:54,490
automating deployment automated

807
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,470
operations and the scaling of

808
00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:00,240
containerized applications across

809
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:05,529
multiple hosts sounds like it's gonna be

810
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:09,729
the stuff of our DevOps dreams solve our

811
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:11,460
container conundrums right and that's

812
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,200
pretty close to what it does

813
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,600
you throw containers at kubernetes and

814
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,859
it's going to schedule these containers

815
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,930
across your infrastructure

816
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:23,320
you tell it how you want it to

817
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,029
communicate and it doesn't write well

818
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,980
anybody here deployed kubernetes

819
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:32,160
themselves couple all right so there are

820
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,450
a couple ways of deploying kubernetes

821
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,370
they're a bunch of points diploma Cooper

822
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,410
days actually one of them you might have

823
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,200
heard of is kubernetes the hard way by

824
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:44,399
Kelsey Hightower he goes deep level

825
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,450
setting up the SSL certificate authority

826
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,240
showing you how to manage your public

827
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:54,160
key infrastructure in order to just get

828
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:56,290
started right so there is a very

829
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,490
difficult way of doing kubernetes and

830
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,350
whatever you do start to build

831
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:02,439
kubernetes even if you go with the quote

832
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:04,839
quote easy way you find out that

833
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,400
kubernetes is not actually just your

834
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,070
end-all be-all you can't just stick in

835
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,920
your CIC pipeline and just call it a day

836
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,330
that would be great

837
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,000
we're gonna build out your kubernetes

838
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,870
cluster you find out that you need some

839
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,339
networking it does not come with

840
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:20,469
networking

841
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:24,449
so you've just got containers and pods

842
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:28,119
just chilling running in place

843
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:29,499
burnin energy good so you got a stick

844
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,549
some networking some employers just

845
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:34,988
throw in like flannel or weave OBS but

846
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:36,969
otherwise you gotta gotta bring that in

847
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:37,779
yourself all right

848
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:39,759
know where you're gonna get your

849
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:42,670
containers from huh everyone's first

850
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:44,289
answers docker hub yeah we're just gonna

851
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,680
pull in some random container right I

852
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:49,689
trust it but what would be better is to

853
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,489
not have every one of my nodes calling

854
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:54,219
out to docker hub every time that they

855
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:56,259
call a new container image to run and

856
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:57,819
pull down so we should probably have our

857
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:59,769
container image registry all right

858
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:01,119
that's gonna be very helpful like if you

859
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,799
want to call yourself doing kubernetes

860
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,819
they ain't gonna register you you're

861
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:09,519
doing something wrong all right now

862
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:12,130
again interacting with the kubernetes

863
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,169
cluster into through three lines but

864
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,420
otherwise it's all API base like if you

865
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,799
can make a rest call to an API endpoint

866
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,390
you can interact with kubernetes and

867
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:24,549
build platforms upon it to do some

868
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:27,640
really really cool things what it is not

869
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:31,689
really extended logging and get some

870
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,699
logs but they're not persistent not easy

871
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:35,319
to access again it's not easy so you're

872
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:36,999
gonna need some things that precipitate

873
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:41,049
that upwards to your users to your

874
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:42,999
developers to your operators we need

875
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:44,109
some way to manage your life cycles it's

876
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:47,769
what happened whenever we have a new

877
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:49,179
container image coming if you have a new

878
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:50,890
container engine your entry doesn't just

879
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:53,589
automatically go okay cool I'm going to

880
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,089
do a boiling point for that and you kind

881
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:57,519
of push that actually make some calls so

882
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,199
now we're building services right so now

883
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:03,129
that we're building our own services to

884
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,630
run kubernetes I guess we need a basing

885
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,670
like we're gonna need some Mongo and

886
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,529
some document storage to you know manage

887
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,759
the data that we're trying to manage on

888
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:12,429
this platform that we're trying to run

889
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:14,140
to build mmm there's a lot of a section

890
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:14,969
here right actually find a lot of

891
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,229
Quebecers

892
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:18,579
all right well you know since we're

893
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:20,460
doing all this and since we're building

894
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,990
a platform on this platform we might as

895
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,020
make a web panel for it to make it nice

896
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:26,209
and easy try not to stay in the crammed

897
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,020
line all day long

898
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:33,480
okay so you thought we were done you

899
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,900
thought that was Cooper Nettie's well

900
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,740
you're still wrong

901
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,240
there's still a lot of things they need

902
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,649
to build into it's actually make it

903
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:46,399
usable right and that's where you kind

904
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:49,020
of get hit with this like sharp again

905
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,430
there's all the fun kubernetes stuff

906
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,730
that you can go into there's some

907
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:58,379
networking options registry options some

908
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,780
configurations code options storage

909
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,680
options that's real fun what happens

910
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,720
when Amazon decides to you know call out

911
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,910
a new EBS store in a region that you

912
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,250
don't have nodes connected to so your

913
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:13,920
pods is calling up block stores that I

914
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,240
can't connect to that happens that's

915
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,109
real fun unless you figure out how to

916
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:23,279
fix that which a lot of people know but

917
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:25,319
either way and are you thinking you

918
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,190
thought you thought told you that this

919
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,640
is all easy now right but it seems

920
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,310
really complicated and it is that's

921
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,480
definitely true it's very complicated

922
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,070
anybody who does kubernetes tells you

923
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,800
it's very complicated deeper you get

924
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:44,099
into it more complex and more you don't

925
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,680
understand it so let's put the aliens

926
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,849
into perspective do you think the ease

927
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,319
of use is still not there

928
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:56,110
all right they buy your car

929
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,620
your car objectively is pretty easy to

930
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:01,330
use

931
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:02,650
right I need a motor vehicle what's the

932
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,960
thought that comes in your mind all

933
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,100
right your next objectives are

934
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,140
procurement I need some money

935
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,060
alright you go get the money you buy the

936
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,339
car you got the car good means put some

937
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,740
gas in the car you get going and what do

938
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:18,070
you do you're getting a seat you turn it

939
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,620
on as long as everything works you push

940
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:24,450
a couple pedals turn this little thingy

941
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:28,120
and you go that sounds pretty easy right

942
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,220
that is arguably very easy now

943
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:33,690
software is making it even easier to

944
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,009
where you don't have to do most of that

945
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:42,310
and it's actually running people over

946
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:45,490
but um otherwise we're not there Jetsons

947
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,660
yet otherwise whatever people think of I

948
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:52,029
need a vehicle they don't think about

949
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:54,759
all this this is complex this is the

950
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:57,010
factory these are the robots this is the

951
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,410
automation this is a standardization and

952
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:04,750
an optimization of workflows that gets

953
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:07,299
you that easy push start and go a lot of

954
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:10,120
people don't realize that right they

955
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,680
don't sit behind and see the things that

956
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,390
go on the background so when are we

957
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,730
using some of these new software

958
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:18,069
platforms like web flow which is pretty

959
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,380
cool as a tenured programmer I check it

960
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,350
out oh yeah there's a nice make webpages

961
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:25,000
but there's no code you don't cut it off

962
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,190
but everyone's website runs in a new pod

963
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,650
and a new name space on a kubernetes

964
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:32,650
cluster you pay enough they give you

965
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,000
your own cluster but I can go click

966
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,770
click click and have a new website it's

967
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,960
running on kubernetes in a pipeline and

968
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:42,910
also the fun stuff it's easy for me I

969
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,580
can get up and go and drive that's the

970
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:49,509
easiest right this is complex this is

971
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:52,000
hard so thinking about that Factory

972
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,680
let's think about what factories give

973
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,220
you all right

974
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,629
Model T great example I think for

975
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,910
software because again I mentioned

976
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:03,010
earlier there are other industries who

977
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,450
had these problems that have kind of

978
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:11,109
solved when software to start

979
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:15,730
ketchup so the assembly line for Beller

980
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:18,940
country the Ford Motor Company was

981
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:22,240
absolutely revolutionary right nobody

982
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:26,920
can argued that it took the process of

983
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,939
building a car by hand like you guys

984
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,710
want to build a car by hand okay and

985
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:37,210
those are a lot more simple than our

986
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:42,060
cars nowadays it took them 18 hours to

987
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:45,880
build a car so day and a half at least

988
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:48,400
three but whatever it took you a little

989
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,640
while build car it took that assembly

990
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,800
line that factory took the process of 18

991
00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:00,578
hours to make a car down three and a

992
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:03,130
half so within a decade they went from a

993
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:06,520
ho-hum Motor Company to building over

994
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:11,470
half of the cars in North America and

995
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:16,119
about 40% of them in Europe that's quick

996
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:18,160
capability right that's what kind of

997
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:22,180
start to see today we're starting to see

998
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:25,149
that today with software factories okay

999
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,859
they're easy to use once then you got

1000
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,569
them set up once they're ready to rock

1001
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:30,609
and roll once you've operationalized so

1002
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:33,400
once you've optimized your workflows and

1003
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:37,470
made everything automated where it is as

1004
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:44,530
easy as click click boom they have

1005
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:48,640
pretty impressive capabilities USCIS has

1006
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:51,819
a standardized software Factory and they

1007
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,328
allowed their accomplishment of being

1008
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:58,920
able to take a new developer and in the

1009
00:45:55,329 --> 00:46:02,530
same day having them deploy a production

1010
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,440
system in their pipeline 80% of their

1011
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,090
applications get deployed within their

1012
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,880
application

1013
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,800
it's pretty impressive stuff to be able

1014
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,080
to upskill something backward and to be

1015
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,350
able to get them pretty advanced

1016
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,509
weaponry that quickly as well so

1017
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,330
building applications all day every day

1018
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,850
everyone is doing it right but not

1019
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:26,640
everyone's doing it right leave you a

1020
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:29,970
couple of thoughts where are you getting

1021
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,710
your software from all right open source

1022
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,069
software earlier open source software is

1023
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:38,910
great but what's behind the sheets

1024
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:41,280
what's under gutters sometimes can be

1025
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,120
pretty scary there was some report run

1026
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,820
the other day

1027
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:49,680
that said there was only like 12 node

1028
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:53,190
modules if any of them were compromised

1029
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:57,060
it would in effect compromise the bulk

1030
00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:00,720
of applications running on know there's

1031
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:05,100
a couple foundational packages right so

1032
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:08,540
what packages are you pulling it now

1033
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:11,819
that you're building these sort of

1034
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:14,520
integrations with your github repo with

1035
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:17,150
a vault cuz you got sort of secret

1036
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,930
somewhere when you're kubernetes cluster

1037
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:23,300
anyone can quickly access your building

1038
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,589
all these different connections what if

1039
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,900
something is compromised docker hub got

1040
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,540
compromised not too long ago and was

1041
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:34,740
found out that everyone's keys were

1042
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:38,910
taken his left so if you had a github

1043
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:43,200
repo attached to docker hub you had that

1044
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:45,990
integration compromise something about a

1045
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:50,339
lot people think oh now you're dealing

1046
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:52,229
kubernetes like it'll get out of your

1047
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,470
hands very quickly this very complex

1048
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:58,350
system you need enablement you need

1049
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,879
training you need up skill because I've

1050
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,470
been working with stuff for years and I

1051
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,410
still don't understand

1052
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:07,950
I got make custom resource definitions

1053
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:11,220
and some of the underlying subsystems

1054
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:13,049
are still complex on top of that think

1055
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,459
about this we've standardized on

1056
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:20,330
kubernetes it's all written in go

1057
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:23,090
there was a go ssl library vulnerability

1058
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,250
discovered not too long ago and guess

1059
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,780
what everyone's kubernetes clusters were

1060
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,480
vulnerable

1061
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:34,100
everyone's until you got this quick

1062
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:38,420
patch but enablement is extremely

1063
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,770
important so I'll be discussing some of

1064
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,540
those tomorrow

1065
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,310
am I not so secure software factories

1066
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,350
discussion where a lot should be taken a

1067
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,060
couple of these bits of park showing you

1068
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:49,220
how to attack these software factories

1069
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:53,570
and how to defend against them but

1070
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:59,299
today's takeaways and software is eating

1071
00:48:53,570 --> 00:49:02,140
the world so don't let it eat you okay

1072
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,710
Amazon pushes out their applications

1073
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,529
thousands of times a day

1074
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:09,350
if you've ever loaded amazon.com and ten

1075
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,190
minutes gone back later when this looks

1076
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:14,000
really different

1077
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:16,700
not just the ads but just like actual

1078
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,430
layout the page the way you interact

1079
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:22,040
with it is different they do

1080
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:25,190
psychological testing thousands of times

1081
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,070
a day blue/green tests to see if this

1082
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,590
version is gonna make you click and buy

1083
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:33,190
more and faster more often and get you

1084
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:35,680
into their ecosystem even deeper

1085
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:40,760
that's your software Factory at Amazon

1086
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:43,279
you know you need to learn automation

1087
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,400
but whatever you do make sure to do it

1088
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,670
securely I'd love to pick on Tesla

1089
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,980
because they quickly deployed kubernetes

1090
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:54,500
clusters everywhere they thought hey

1091
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:57,470
we're paying someone $750 an hour to do

1092
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:00,530
this kubernetes thing they must know it

1093
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:03,529
pretty well except they left a dashboard

1094
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:06,820
open publicly unauthenticated or

1095
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,820
anyone's access in control

1096
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:15,750
outside of that your CICE pipeline

1097
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,010
should be treated like gold it should be

1098
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,830
a first-class citizen in your

1099
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,810
considerations wet mins anybody use

1100
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,670
webmin it's like a it's like a cPanel

1101
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:27,810
but free of sources lets you control

1102
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:31,880
your linux servers with the gooiest it's

1103
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:34,440
cpanel basically plus what weapons CIC

1104
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,240
pipeline had been compromised and they

1105
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,510
found out that had been compromised for

1106
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:43,500
about three and a half years

1107
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:46,380
so if you use webmin within I'd say

1108
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,910
probably about the last five you

1109
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,090
probably running vulnerable software on

1110
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:56,160
your server not really knowing alright

1111
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,720
if you're running webmin on your server

1112
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,069
I mean unpatched as it is right now

1113
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,250
you're running vulnerable server they

1114
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:04,980
had their CIO DCD server Jenkins server

1115
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,900
it was hacked and since it is the

1116
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,300
automation server that builds all their

1117
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:13,370
software they said well just stick this

1118
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:16,830
in here and it's got web mins you know

1119
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:19,470
PGP key securing the application it's

1120
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:21,540
coming from web min you download it if

1121
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,549
there's nothing weird or spooky about

1122
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,650
getting this application when you look

1123
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:37,350
at it you don't know that was built with

1124
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:39,150
some malicious code I mean it came from

1125
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,830
an era of web development that should

1126
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:44,160
definitely been buried with the whole

1127
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,830
geo civics thing so now everyone is

1128
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,779
building software and you know everyone

1129
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:54,120
has any company as a software company

1130
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:58,560
now right and I think if you've been in

1131
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:00,420
the tech industry for at least given a

1132
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,330
few years you might have noticed the

1133
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,040
uptick in vulnerability reports this

1134
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,110
person got happens

1135
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,670
this software is insecure this has got a

1136
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:11,240
back door that's got default admin

1137
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,240
credentials

1138
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,660
we're probably seeing that because

1139
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,399
there's just more software out there

1140
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,960
there's more people active on there

1141
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,790
there were more people using it there

1142
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,750
are more people attack together they're

1143
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:30,020
just more ovens so you should probably

1144
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:31,790
learn how to build some software which

1145
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,770
we'll be doing that tomorrow but for

1146
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:36,890
this any questions comments concerns

1147
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:40,160
problems Furies conundrums projectile

1148
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:42,470
from a peanut gallery you're gonna be

1149
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,899
attacking some software tomorrow yep and
