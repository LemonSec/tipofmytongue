1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:21,880
yep good for everyone so my name is

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,650
Tyler I am going to give the talk on

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:30,310
badge making I'm not a professional PCB

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,890
designer or engineer or anything but how

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,409
do you have a couple of couple badges

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,379
I've put together a couple PCBs and

7
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:40,690
together project sometimes so I figure

8
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:44,079
I'd share mine trials and tribulations

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,428
with you but see if I inspire something

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,260
elbow built to be around so Who am I

11
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:51,639
like I said I'm Tyler I live in

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,769
Huntsville Alabama

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,639
I work for an IFC company doing smart

14
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:57,519
lighting solutions

15
00:00:54,639 --> 00:01:00,399
I do software development there and my

16
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,409
free time I like doing a CNC machine or

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,829
other laser cutters Mills stuff like

18
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,610
that

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,800
and obvious PCB design so just any

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,490
little one-off projects helping people

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,658
with their their stuff and liking lots

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,969
and lots and lots of

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,070
how did you said so some of you have

24
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,070
probably seen seen this this term match

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,398
life I kind of originated with the DEF

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,158
CON

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,720
drought they started putting together

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,289
conference about it just kind of like

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,369
these but with electronics

30
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:38,960
you know circuit boards there they range

31
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:42,780
from just blinking lights on them to

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,658
puzzles and games and interactivity like

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,030
connections you know alternate reality

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,860
games and just it just went crazy people

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,209
started doing a lot of really cool

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,399
things with them in the last couple of

37
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,679
years and so it's been really exciting

38
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,130
to see that kind of open up and become

39
00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:01,649
more accessible to everyone so here's a

40
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,130
couple of examples of some some badge

41
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,649
life going on and you can see all the

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,630
different LEDs and different shapes

43
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,220
they're not your standard PCB because

44
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,829
you don't just get you know a green

45
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,140
rectangle like fun in your computer you

46
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:19,170
get crazy shapes and colors and lights

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,160
so these head like screens on them and

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:27,810
sensors and expansion ports and all

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,150
sorts of wild stuff so some features

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,489
that you'll find on a lot of badges are

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,650
usually battery-powered you don't want

52
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,420
to have to have an extension cable to

53
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,620
plug into your your badge while you're

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:47,640
walking around

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:49,590
tripping people yeah yeah sure yeah drop

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,839
down a little bit sometimes there's a

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,840
lot of sensors yeah

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,060
it depends some most of these are just

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,700
kind of people like me who just decided

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,580
to design some badges and have fun

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,560
they're usually sent off to a fab to be

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,260
made so they're not handmade or anything

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:18,380
like that but yeah they're usually made

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:21,230
pretty small no so so those badges are

65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,570
created by a separate group and they do

66
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,899
about a small batch of a thousand that

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,430
they then hot drop in Las Vegas and you

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,140
kind of have to follow them on Twitter

69
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,910
to find out where they are to buy them

70
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,869
because these are not like DEFCON

71
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,180
regulated stuff they just sell them

72
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,350
freely they don't do licensing and stuff

73
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,730
like that because it's like you're a

74
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,109
seller in Las Vegas you can get in

75
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,579
trouble for selling stuff and not paying

76
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,290
taxes so there it's a very you know

77
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:52,430
DEFCON is I guess right yeah so a lot of

78
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:56,120
these are just kind of like kind of sort

79
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,420
of just community driven projects but

80
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,920
they do make official conference badges

81
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,470
- ten minutes

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,329
you do get a badge in there lately

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,390
they've been electronic badges so this

84
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:15,520
is from this year's Def Con it had some

85
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:18,108
sort of like NFC style communication

86
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,630
I've brought my Def Con badge from two

87
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,370
years ago the one with the game that's

88
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,860
built into it so they won't see that I

89
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,120
can pull it out there's there's there's

90
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,380
a lot of different ways that people do

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,380
pageants so compare

92
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:37,000
at Def Con its hundreds of dollars yes

93
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,138
they're about it because 300 or $40 but

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,180
yeah and there are definitely cheaper

95
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:45,010
badges and these badges are like 250

96
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:49,450
bucks but they also get you know party

97
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,450
yeah there's a there's a whole community

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,409
another another big thing about the

99
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,350
badges that has been really popular is

100
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,790
that they're interactive a badge that

101
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,130
disco since they're playing this is kind

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,350
of neat but if you can do something with

103
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,240
it that adds a lot of a lot of

104
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,930
excitement around it so a lot of them

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,550
have games and puzzles like mentioned

106
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,700
but some of them are just there hackable

107
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,860
they have ports exposed and they have

108
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,260
serial communications that you can

109
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,360
terminal in on your computer and connect

110
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,280
to its and commands and certain kind of

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,190
playing with the badge and that's always

112
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,200
really exciting for people and then most

113
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,370
importantly pretty much that's a

114
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,789
blinking light so I'm not gonna say I'm

115
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:40,070
not gonna say you have to but I'm so I

116
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,099
kind of touched on this about the

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,830
extension ports so one thing that's

118
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,330
happened pretty recently is they've kind

119
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:53,180
of standardized on a protocol for

120
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:58,010
extending onto badges and they call this

121
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,880
the sword art online so that's the

122
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,919
shitty add-on protocol it provides you

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,610
with a port that you can plug in tiny

124
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,849
versions of badges into the ports and

125
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,530
it's like a pseudo standard it's not

126
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,289
fully operable like you can't just

127
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,690
connect anything to anything but you get

128
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,800
close and so most of the add-ons are

129
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,290
just LEDs don't have any like

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,390
microcontrollers on them

131
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,700
there are some that are pretty complex

132
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,990
and start putting puzzles together when

133
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,140
you start connecting different things to

134
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,080
these ports so I'm going to talk a

135
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,180
little bit about the protocol so the

136
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,109
latest version of the protocol is the

137
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,050
1.69

138
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:45,310
this there are two versions there's the

139
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,710
11.0 and this one 1.0 only had four pins

140
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,230
this adds adds two new pins which kind

141
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,299
of helps with the ruggedness of the

142
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,710
connector and gives you a little bit to

143
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,170
to play with but in terms of

144
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,479
connectivity so that I have two

145
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:03,250
connectors one goes on the badge and one

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,700
goes on the add-on they connect you've

147
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,090
got a 3 volt rail you've got a ground

148
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,409
pen and then you got I squared C SDA SCL

149
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,789
pins and 2 GPIO pins at use for

150
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,520
controlling lights or you can use it to

151
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:22,120
detect what kind of add-on you've

152
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,599
plugged into your board but it that's

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,120
basically all the protocol specifies not

154
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,340
much more than that so I don't expect

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,520
everything just to work but you can kind

156
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,900
of at least know where your power ground

157
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,650
are coming from you can line up like

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,650
that

159
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,500
so the other other part is they defined

160
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,080
which pens are which so they have these

161
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,550
key connectors that have these little

162
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,159
not just cut out of them so you can't

163
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,710
plug them in backwards they're kind of

164
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,539
hard to find you can use regular pin

165
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:00,840
headers and they'll work it's a standard

166
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:02,370
pitch width but these specifically these

167
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,159
connectors are hard to find

168
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,530
those you can find everywhere because

169
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,909
they're used for cables to be plugged

170
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,239
into like other tools and stuff like

171
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:14,190
that because this is not a cable it's a

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,610
connector there's not often a whole lot

173
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,219
of use for plugging in a board into

174
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,530
another board like this so kind of

175
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,990
harder to find I'll give you some tips

176
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,508
on where to where to search to find that

177
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,300
is but don't worry if you can't find

178
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,199
them you can just use regular female pin

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
head or something

180
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,000
they won't suck it into that connector

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,439
behind and feel free to stop me if you

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,179
have any questions I'm just gonna kind

183
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,919
of there's no really the story to this

184
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,478
presentation it's just kind of things

185
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,218
I've learned and things I've seen and so

186
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,000
if you see something anyone asked

187
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:51,600
question about it kids to you so this is

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,149
the bench I built for this year friend

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,180
dusty had a good idea he was like we

190
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,630
should make badge ones like re what what

191
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,510
should it be

192
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,449
he's like heats up I was like alright

193
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:07,079
we'll do it and so we put together this

194
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:09,569
this badge right here looks like pizza

195
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,189
it's got some LEDs on it and the bigger

196
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,050
toppings would be a really cool way to

197
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,959
use the SAO

198
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,160
add-ons so I could detect which toppings

199
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,199
you have on there and you know that

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,069
having a pineapple on pizzas illegal so

201
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,069
the port's explode

202
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:30,320
so we put that together it didn't quite

203
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,970
get finished in time so I'll talk a

204
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,250
little bit more about about that but

205
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,670
it'll definitely be ready for next year

206
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,290
play with a cool pizza board so here's

207
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,150
what it looks like it's got the topping

208
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,160
slots it's got the the battery on the

209
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:48,709
back and so it it's using an ESP 32

210
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,760
which is so Wi-Fi Bluetooth micro

211
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,560
controller a pretty high power but but

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,380
it's a very neat board it has a lot of

213
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,569
really cool features powered by a single

214
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,430
double-a battery I'll talk about some

215
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,960
trials and tribulations for that part

216
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,880
too

217
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,410
it has capacitive touch pads so you can

218
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,140
touch on the back of it and that's what

219
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,969
can do some sort of interactivity parts

220
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,949
so you can touch the different pads and

221
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:18,910
do different things with that and it's

222
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,560
got 16 individually addressable r2b LEDs

223
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,829
which are amazing they're so fun to play

224
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,270
with they're pretty cheap they can they

225
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,890
just add a whole lot you can have

226
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,600
regular LEDs and they light up in the

227
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,189
school but when you can really do like

228
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,150
all the patterns and some colors and

229
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:39,530
stuff like that then it's got three of

230
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:42,949
the SAO ports for the toppings or your

231
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,780
own SEO add-on you can get a little kind

232
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,830
of weird it's kind of rotated in weird

233
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,790
way so if you get like that little

234
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,410
Pikachu ad on a movie sideways but you

235
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,990
want to be

236
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,730
and and so they said you have HIV

237
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,480
toppings I've gotta show you some of

238
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,610
them but yeah basically the whole

239
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,590
purpose this talk you can make your own

240
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,110
it's not too bad you can you can start

241
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,110
very simple you can move on to super

242
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,110
complex but you can definitely do it

243
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,780
this moment it's not too bad you need a

244
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,100
couple things to get started so there's

245
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,900
a couple software tools that help you

246
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,210
get off the ground

247
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,860
kicad is my favorite you know software

248
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,670
so electronic design so that's where you

249
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,930
design your schematic your PCBs and

250
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,089
that's where it will generate the files

251
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,390
that you send off to a fabrication house

252
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,740
and they will make your reports for you

253
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,020
if you're using a microcontroller

254
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,480
I really like Arduino it's really easy

255
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,790
to pick up libraries right and

256
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,940
everything from scratch and then for

257
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,550
graphical design you can use Inkscape

258
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,550
you can also use Adobe tools I use

259
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,910
illustrator alive you can use Microsoft

260
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,439
Paint it doesn't really matter it

261
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,880
doesn't have to be vector - sorry but it

262
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,500
just kind of helps keep keep things

263
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,500
clean and manufacturable

264
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,240
you'll need a couple of hard rituals

265
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:11,779
these top two are the most important

266
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,060
multimeter and a soldering iron even if

267
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:16,790
you get the board's fully assembled

268
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,099
populated still need still need those

269
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,750
two you need to test your board there

270
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,610
will be mistakes especially when you're

271
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,379
starting and you will need to make tiny

272
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,550
adjustments on your prototype boards

273
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,029
that you make glue so you don't get them

274
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,430
mixed up the real boards I had to run

275
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,170
wires back and forth just to make

276
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,349
modifications just to get the prototype

277
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,670
working and then I can order new boards

278
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,079
that have this fix is built into the

279
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,310
board it helps you have a nothin if

280
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,519
you're doing any surface mount parties

281
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,500
you can do a lot of them by hand but if

282
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,959
you're making more than 10 boards it

283
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,189
really helps to have some sort of more

284
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,018
machine operated process to kind of help

285
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:05,269
put those boards together did you say

286
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:07,879
open yes so this is an IR reflow oven so

287
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,949
these are used to solder up boards with

288
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:11,930
surface mount parts so when you put

289
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:13,849
parts on but on top of those solder

290
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,920
paste and that when it cooks in the oven

291
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,060
it melts down the solder grab some of

292
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,279
the part that's kind of lines them up

293
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,579
and it cools off you can have your

294
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,579
partner

295
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,560
this is a little bit easier so this is

296
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:33,910
the t96 to a I believe the picture I

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,560
grabbed a toaster oven will work because

298
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,810
it all that law does is you'd have to

299
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,969
pour the solder know you may have to

300
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,349
hack it a little bit first because you

301
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,240
gotta control the flow of the the

302
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,779
temperature increase edit or you can

303
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,220
you're watching the solder melt alright

304
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,560
well I've never thought about that

305
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,570
really like that yeah

306
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,670
this helps a lot it's press a button go

307
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,810
and just just kind of work so you can

308
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,160
get these for like two hundred three

309
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:02,260
hundred dollars any sense

310
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,060
ir yes that's that's the common of it

311
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,040
tight there are some convection ovens

312
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,410
stuff like that but the ir ones are

313
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,410
really cheap pretty pretty accessible

314
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:16,959
so your most important tool it's time so

315
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,899
that's kind of why the pizza isn't ready

316
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,910
this time I gave myself a couple of

317
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,629
months to put the pizzas together and

318
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:28,959
that's not enough so you you want to be

319
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:31,269
preparing very early especially if it's

320
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,309
more complex it's it's simple and just

321
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:35,709
have some LEDs even then you want to

322
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:37,899
give yourself more time but especially

323
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:42,638
if it has a lot of parts a lot of

324
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:46,809
unknowns so things that they contribute

325
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,489
to do time are ordering boards the order

326
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:50,819
of setup prototype boards it might take

327
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:53,949
a couple of weeks to get your boards in

328
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:56,979
then you get them in you build up your

329
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:58,479
your prototypes you test them you start

330
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,579
trying to figure out your debugging

331
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,920
what's going wrong and then you have to

332
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:05,859
order more boards so it's never it's

333
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,618
very rarely a one-time order a bunch of

334
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,439
boards and be done you always want we're

335
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:12,999
a small batch and then test those and

336
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,040
then order the full batch that you can

337
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:19,220
make any changes you need for me

338
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,959
so here's the checklist don't don't

339
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:26,300
worry you can't read it that goose

340
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,160
causing problems but basically there's

341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,359
this is this is why it takes so much

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,100
time because there's a lot of things

343
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,530
that you don't know what's going on and

344
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,300
so on this list I've got you like a

345
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,670
rough sketch your feature list for your

346
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,530
board you select a microcontroller if

347
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,270
you're putting one of those on there put

348
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,310
together your power budget talk about

349
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,290
that design your power supply capture

350
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,780
the schematic map apart it's a place and

351
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,120
route the parts you draw the board

352
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,300
outline so that cuts out properly on the

353
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,160
on the router you do your silkscreen and

354
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,500
visual adjustments you work with a

355
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,390
prototype suggest the prototypes you

356
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,220
make your PCB fit to the fixes you write

357
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,500
your software you build all the boards

358
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,670
and put it all together sometimes you do

359
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,250
a lot of these steps over and over again

360
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,800
so like really you want you want to have

361
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,050
that time so don't don't try to wait too

362
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,270
long if it's coming close and you

363
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,420
haven't started yet go ahead and start

364
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:21,079
but plan for the next time don't don't

365
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,579
try to rush it it's usually not fun so

366
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,820
I'm gonna talk about the power budget a

367
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:29,000
little bit so these are battery powered

368
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,230
devices so you have to consider a lot of

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,630
things you gotta consider all the parts

370
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,510
that are going on the on the board so

371
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,560
you can extend your battery life if

372
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,000
you're doing something that's plugged

373
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,160
and you want to worry about this as much

374
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but for badges that's very important so

375
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,500
consider all the parts on your board

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,600
LEDs microcontrollers sensors whatever

377
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,580
whatever else you have on there I go to

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,710
the data sheets see how much power they

379
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,250
draw add it all up it adds up very

380
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,230
quickly even even small things like LEDs

381
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,510
little sensors little flash chips it

382
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,089
adds up so go ahead and count all of

383
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,689
those things

384
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,799
consider the sleep modes of your chips

385
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:13,640
some microcontrollers have a lot of

386
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:16,429
sleep mode characteristics sensors often

387
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,870
have sleep mode options or sometimes

388
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,780
they just go into idle and go into sleep

389
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,569
mode and with that you need to consider

390
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:27,049
your duty cycle so when you have a full

391
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:29,720
word that is using like a

392
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,520
microcontroller for like this most of

393
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,020
the time it's gonna be asleep it's gonna

394
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,370
wake up whenever it needs to do

395
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,200
something it's gonna wake up with

396
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,250
someone's interacting with it it's gonna

397
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,289
wake up on a timer

398
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,110
every five seconds wake up complain

399
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:43,129
stuff like that you need to take that

400
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,928
into account when you're trying to

401
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,690
figure out how much power does this

402
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,940
device use and then you have to

403
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,159
determine what your expected lifetime is

404
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,500
so if you're doing this for a two or

405
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:56,710
three day con maybe four days it's long

406
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,780
enough don't try to make it last a year

407
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,070
you know you're just over complicating

408
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,960
the problem there and you're probably

409
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,960
missing out on a lot of interactivity

410
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,389
when designing a power supply there's

411
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,520
some helpful tools out there so like I

412
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,649
said you can do this you don't have to

413
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,830
be an electrical engineer to to do all

414
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:22,039
this Texas Instruments has a tool called

415
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,379
web bench and it can help you build a

416
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,090
power supply which is one of the most

417
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,409
annoying pieces of electrical

418
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,049
engineering this you've ever have to

419
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:33,320
interact with it does it for you that's

420
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,690
that's great you put in what input

421
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,820
voltages you're going to get and what

422
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,200
output voltage you expect to get and

423
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,899
what sort of current drawing you need

424
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
and it will go pick some parts and put

425
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:45,918
together a schematic for you it will

426
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,100
even do a little bit of a PCB design

427
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,830
layout and provide you the Bill of

428
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,370
Materials thing you need this chip and

429
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,100
these ambassadors and the

430
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,129
and doctors just little here and no

431
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,409
power supply this hasn't failed me yet

432
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,140
I've used it to build or buy power

433
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,380
supplies it's been really nice tells you

434
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,240
exactly how much it's gonna cost exactly

435
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,540
how much room it will take home afford

436
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,300
and it'll tell you like what the

437
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,649
efficiency of that power supply is so

438
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,760
imma beat says for example it has at one

439
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:23,190
double-a batteries and that's 1.5 volts

440
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,520
the LEDs on the on the board need 5

441
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,590
volts so I deduced that 1.5 up to 5 drop

442
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,110
that in here got a circuit build this

443
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:36,110
works great highly highly recommend

444
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:39,449
mister alright so onto some more

445
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,879
artistic parts of the board so PCBs are

446
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:46,230
designed in layers like an onion or an

447
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,900
ogre the middle layer right here is the

448
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,390
fiberglass so this is the non conductive

449
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:55,200
substrate that the whole PCB kind of

450
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:58,620
sits on it's got kind of a yellowish

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:03,110
tint I'm gonna pass out some sample

452
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,110
boards they keep will go

453
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,610
so y'all can look at them while I'm

454
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,610
talking

455
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,739
just pass these around take a couple you

456
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,129
can keep these either these are going to

457
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:34,610
be handy if you go to something a board

458
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:38,980
it'll kind of show up some of the color

459
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:41,570
mechanisms so you're designing things

460
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,429
like digital art usually have all the

461
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,799
colors that you can show on your screen

462
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,830
or on your printer on a PCB you're much

463
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,279
more limited by the manufacturing

464
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,279
process

465
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:09,300
I think that should be enough

466
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:12,610
you don't get one just so like I said

467
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,280
middle layer is the fiberglass semi

468
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,809
trans-pacific translucent it's a

469
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,379
yellowish greenish color usually

470
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:22,300
sometimes it's a beige color but on

471
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,920
either side of that is the copper traces

472
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,379
so when you're designing your PCB

473
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:31,600
anywhere even but copper lines or fills

474
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,530
that will be on top of the fiberglass

475
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,820
layer above that is the solder mask so

476
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,750
the solder mask is what gives

477
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,189
PCBs those that green color it's there's

478
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,960
usually a couple of different colors you

479
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,110
can choose from some one I'm passing

480
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,110
around as a blue solder mask the pizzas

481
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:55,540
used a yellow solder mask they have red

482
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:56,800
or black and white green just a couple

483
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,020
of couple of different options it's not

484
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,649
not infinite but usually have a set of

485
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:06,240
motions that you think from and then on

486
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:08,770
top of that is the silkscreen layer so

487
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,300
usually you only get one or two options

488
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:15,730
for color on that usually get white like

489
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,540
on the port's that are in your hands on

490
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:23,980
white PCBs usually get a black color on

491
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:26,860
this one sometimes you can ask for black

492
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,230
on a blue PCB some places will do it

493
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,870
some places won't another reason why you

494
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,240
start ahead of time so that

495
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,949
you can ask these questions and find a

496
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,620
manufacturer they will give you what you

497
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,179
want so the thing you got in your hand

498
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,969
is my little color swatch I put together

499
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,490
just to kind of show off the different

500
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:50,669
mechanisms for generating color with

501
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:56,059
such limited color options so on the far

502
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:59,159
right on that side you have exposed

503
00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:03,360
copper plating and so that actually is a

504
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,179
gold plated material whenever you don't

505
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,158
have solder mask but you do have copper

506
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:10,230
that's how that will show up so you can

507
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,909
get that really shiny shiny gold color

508
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,200
if you're doing gold plating you get a

509
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:16,740
really shiny silver color if you're

510
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,460
doing the solder solder plating I'll go

511
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,110
into a little bit of that later moving

512
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,860
our way left

513
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,658
that's the exposed fiberglass it's

514
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,240
exposed on both sides so you can see

515
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,119
kind of how translucid it is if you hold

516
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,399
it up to the to the light it looks like

517
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,649
through its kind of got that sort of

518
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:39,809
soft edge where you can see the shadow

519
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,779
from the rest of the work coming in on

520
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,259
it that gives you that that's pretty

521
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,700
colored that's sort of beige color

522
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:49,619
sometimes you have to be careful because

523
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,879
sometimes that fiberglass layer actually

524
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:55,559
has printing on it just depends on where

525
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:58,010
they get their their fiber glass

526
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,620
substrate from

527
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,240
but it's a it's a color people don't

528
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,299
consider when I'm making PCBs they

529
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,520
always think solder mask and the

530
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:12,530
silkscreen to the left of that is the

531
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,540
their solder mask and copper so there's

532
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,460
copper underneath the solder mask and it

533
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,780
sort of lightens up the solder mask you

534
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,540
can kind of see a difference in color

535
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:25,040
there so if you're looking at it like a

536
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:27,620
standard green computer PCB you'll you

537
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,510
can see the traces under the green

538
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:33,080
solder mask and you can kind of tell the

539
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:35,929
two color differences and so that's

540
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,460
that's with copper under it further left

541
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:38,690
that's without copper I'm going to get

542
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,419
that darker color because there's

543
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:45,380
nothing reflecting light back up the

544
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:49,520
miss Halle underneath and then the other

545
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,559
three are just kind of little patterns

546
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,668
you can see that kind of do a little bit

547
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:59,510
of dithering but it's not you can't

548
00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:02,720
really do true design but you can't kind

549
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:05,600
of give the effect of a gradient and

550
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,179
then on the back you kind of have some

551
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,389
other colors that kind of pop up that

552
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:13,910
are even more a little harder to think

553
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:19,040
about being kind of get that green red

554
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:21,679
yellow versions of the fiberglass and

555
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,330
that's because the green is where

556
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,600
there's solder mask on the back of the

557
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:29,750
board and that's kind of showing some of

558
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,129
the blue through the fiberglass the red

559
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,010
one is where the copper is kind of

560
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,570
showing through the back of the board so

561
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,080
there's a lot of really cool color

562
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,620
options that you can build just using

563
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,100
the different layers of the

564
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:48,770
or dismay from anyone have any questions

565
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,770
about that that's kind of kind of weird

566
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,330
that one is actually I think routed out

567
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,780
I think that's I don't that's a level

568
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,100
group yeah oh yeah yes true as it

569
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,620
displayed yeah so I think it is just a

570
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:09,419
big pita it's just a big hole yeah it's

571
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,550
it's crazy wait wait you send Denise

572
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,240
yeah yeah you can send these two baths

573
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:19,169
and they'll make it you know they didn't

574
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:30,860
ask any questions about this like why

575
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:33,630
are you doing this yeah yeah Banta money

576
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,809
American it's just as well are these

577
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,490
three different types of hybrid class no

578
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:40,020
for the three different colors no

579
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,300
there's just it's whatever's on the back

580
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,500
of the porch I agree okay so yeah the

581
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,379
middle ones got the copperish I think

582
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,940
they're on the back the left ones at the

583
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,860
solder mask shining through on the back

584
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,030
so it looks like they're different

585
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,790
colors of fiberglass because the

586
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,570
fiberglass is kind of see-through

587
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:59,550
yeah all the same yeah yeah pleats and

588
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,889
if you want more I've got plenty I made

589
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,970
them just to give up so people can see

590
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,140
them and have them in hand when they're

591
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,670
designing their own board think you're

592
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,800
like okay how's this gonna look as those

593
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,679
kind of about you gonna have a lot

594
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,070
of people contacting you I need help I

595
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,070
hope so

596
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,860
so like I said you can get different

597
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,770
plating you want the pads and expose the

598
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:24,439
copper pieces on the left this is Enoch

599
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,440
which is electro nickel immersion

600
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,149
it's gold lady you say gold plating

601
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,300
don't know what you mean but it's Eni

602
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:37,250
gee that gives you that rich gold color

603
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,389
on the paths it's really handy for

604
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,460
historic boards for a long time

605
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,140
that's why why was designed so they have

606
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,020
PCBs sitting in a warehouse and then you

607
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,650
can just pop it out assemble it the

608
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,600
others tend to corrode with moisture

609
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,390
over time so that's why they designed

610
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,060
this this process makes soldering a

611
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:01,670
little babies here but on the right is

612
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:05,000
hassle the hot-air solder leveling that

613
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:07,320
gives you that sort of silver color and

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,630
so depending on what your board is you

615
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,939
can you can use either once you solder

616
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,440
pieces onto here it's gonna be the

617
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,290
second sulfur color so keep that in mind

618
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,720
as you're putting parts on a board if

619
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,840
you are using just regular pads and

620
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,390
holes once you solder them up you're not

621
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,800
gonna see that gold color so you need to

622
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,020
make sure if you're trying to get that

623
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,010
gold hold effect to leave those exposed

624
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,010
and don't solder on them

625
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,420
so as sort of the process I used to to

626
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,680
do the visual aspects I usually start

627
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:46,120
with the board outline and work my way

628
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:49,210
through the different layers so this is

629
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,760
a shape that will be evident very

630
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,270
shortly I'm sure most of you have drawn

631
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,860
the shape in your life and don't have it

632
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,230
so you start with the shape it can be an

633
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,350
image it can be a vector image it

634
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,970
doesn't really matter the kicad has an

635
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,419
option where you can import images and

636
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,800
it'll create parts for you so I can't

637
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,570
really see in that third picture that

638
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,480
that's the board outline imported into

639
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,750
kicad and then that's the the 3d

640
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,120
rendering of the board cut out what

641
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:25,150
software use a PKI key Kevin okay I

642
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:27,790
guess yep yeah he Kent's open-source PCB

643
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,820
design software it's free it's currently

644
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:34,090
being bankrolled by CERN made the Large

645
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,370
Hadron Collider research groups of very

646
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,908
cool organization keeping that keeping

647
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:42,178
that project afloat

648
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:44,370
so after you get the board outline you

649
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,529
can start playing with the copper layers

650
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,768
and the silkscreen layers whatever else

651
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:51,809
same exact process you loaded in an

652
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:54,450
image we run it through the little bit

653
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:57,928
map converter you drop the part on the

654
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:01,440
board and then you get whatever whatever

655
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,940
you're trying to do you can so this is

656
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,220
using the silk screen using the white

657
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,070
silk screen you can also use a solder

658
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,870
mask if you want to do a different color

659
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,879
you use the copper plating you want to

660
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,219
show through that way just whatever you

661
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:17,730
need to do make your make your design

662
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,570
work so who here is not drawing us in

663
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,730
like middle school 203 now you never

664
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,939
never do the little s3 with all the

665
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,940
lines

666
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,350
so selecting carts got some tips here

667
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,970
consider your part technology

668
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:43,639
so there's surface mount technology and

669
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,920
three of old technologies through-hole

670
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,630
is sort of like the old school like you

671
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,950
have a resistor and it's got wires and

672
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,920
you bend them put up their holes and

673
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,770
solder the other side those are really

674
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,170
easy to do by hand they're not great if

675
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,879
you want to make a thousand boards just

676
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,710
because you can't really automate that

677
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,260
process very well it takes a lot of time

678
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,120
to bend the leads and put them through

679
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,720
the holes inside of the I decide flip it

680
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,520
over and all that stuff but sell it a

681
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,170
spit you have them soldered their own so

682
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,200
you can do that and that's and that's a

683
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,790
big a big plus there is if you're making

684
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,310
a fairly simple board and you want

685
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,040
people to assemble it themselves that's

686
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,240
really popular and you usually want to

687
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,620
use through-hole parts for that just

688
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,110
because it's a lot easier to put

689
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,979
together by hand

690
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,020
surface mount you get a lot of smaller

691
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,560
parts a lot cheaper parts a lot more

692
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:40,389
manufacturable pieces but yeah a lot

693
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:43,570
harder to debug and test can be done

694
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,520
consider the size of your parts you can

695
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:49,149
use really really tiny resistors and

696
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,070
cram a bunch of stuff on gear board but

697
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,860
it makes it harder to manufacture you're

698
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:57,639
using tiny parts that have tiny pins

699
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,020
that are underneath the board that just

700
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,610
you know you can't you can't put

701
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,650
together with a soldering iron it makes

702
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,590
it really hard to reliably manufacture

703
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,169
it yourself it even makes it a little

704
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:11,649
bit harder for fabrication houses to

705
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:14,200
expand fetcher and assemble boards but

706
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,539
makes your board smaller and I mean to

707
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,590
put more things on it so there's a

708
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,669
there's a balance that were just

709
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,280
something to consider when you're

710
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:26,350
picking your parts and most importantly

711
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:29,020
its cost that's that's a big driver what

712
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:33,908
what we did is solve a hobby for most of

713
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:36,460
us I can't afford to make $150 badges

714
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,630
every time especially we need want to

715
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,039
make a hundred of them so you can give

716
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,100
them out of the conference or so a lot

717
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,679
of conference or something and then the

718
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,289
number of number of parts it's a big

719
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,960
difference having a badge that has you

720
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:52,120
know a resistor and an LED on it versus

721
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,409
one that has 16 RGB LEDs and a

722
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,139
microcontroller or two power supplies

723
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:58,600
and three add-on ports and an i2c

724
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,490
multiplexer and stuff like that that's a

725
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,139
pretty quick every little part you that

726
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,530
on there just makes it more cockpit but

727
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,690
together so better mind so these are a

728
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,280
couple places I buy parts from Mouser

729
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,039
and ichiki on the left those are in the

730
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,960
u.s. they're very reliable getting part

731
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:17,950
to see very quickly very good search

732
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,950
mechanisms sometimes work connectors I

733
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,930
go to eBay

734
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,140
it's kind of weird but there's a lot of

735
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:29,160
Chinese sellers on eBay that have a very

736
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,890
inexpensive connector selection but it's

737
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,260
a lot less reliable so if you if you're

738
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,910
making one batch of boards and go to you

739
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,030
bet grab them but if you want to use a

740
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,680
connector that you can rely on wait and

741
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:45,060
use it as a later board

742
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,970
you probably want something else don't

743
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,530
yeah don't buy FTDI chips on ebay

744
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:54,240
they're usually clones almost always

745
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:57,830
funds work on ships at TBI it's a brand

746
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,840
that makes Cyril adapters and they had

747
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,780
and they were pirating fgi chips are

748
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,320
good and on ebay you can't tell which is

749
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,210
which they look exactly the same and MTV

750
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,029
I started cracking down and actually

751
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,679
speaking to you yeah yeah yeah if it's

752
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:17,669
less than $4 is probably not an empty

753
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,660
budget another good source I I found

754
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:22,230
recently is Ella

755
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:26,159
LCSC they're sort of like more like

756
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:29,550
Mouser and digi-key but they're based up

757
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,509
China elite they they have a lot of

758
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:36,560
parts that you can't buy on

759
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:40,790
do pixels for example the RGB LEDs they

760
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,379
have those on LCSC it's a little bit

761
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:48,800
more reliable than eBay but they're

762
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:50,449
pretty cheap no not exactly like you

763
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,379
said cutter than the same spot that I

764
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:56,210
use eBay when you're trying to find

765
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:59,480
particularly connectors it's really

766
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:02,690
useful but again it's kind of hard to

767
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,079
rely bender from like Aliexpress stuff

768
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,829
like that because they don't provide as

769
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,630
much information usually with like data

770
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,119
sheets and models and footprints and

771
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,940
stuff like that but II base usually a

772
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,250
little bit easier to get started with le

773
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,540
Express kind of got some weird payment

774
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,820
options and something that I think they

775
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,529
use PayPal now but for a while yet to

776
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,410
use like specifically a Visa credit card

777
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,780
and not a debit card there's weird

778
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,730
things to get payment through but now

779
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,200
I'll Express le Bob are good sources for

780
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,200
a lot of those parts too

781
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,280
so for manufacturing the boards I'm just

782
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,440
getting the ports printed cut there

783
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,940
couple options I've you smart

784
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,800
prototyping a lot they they can do

785
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,680
fairly inexpensive boards they have a

786
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,580
lot of solder mask of color options

787
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,230
they're the ones who made the beads of

788
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,120
words so if you want to see what kind of

789
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,580
quality they put out come with these

790
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,370
boards actually they made the boards

791
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,630
that are in your hand too

792
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,160
they have yeah like I said a couple

793
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,660
little solder mask color options they

794
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:16,819
have blue green yellow red purple black

795
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:19,490
matte black white so pretty much the

796
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,900
standard selection of colors a neat

797
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,000
thing about them as they let me put the

798
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,020
black solder mask on the yellow PCB

799
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
which is not super common jail CPCB did

800
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,400
not let me do that they have very strict

801
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,700
no this is how our boards are made so

802
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:41,570
you did no substitutions but jail see

803
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,649
PCB is a little bit cheaper and they

804
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:46,520
have a couple of options they're

805
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:48,830
actually run by the same parent company

806
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,470
as LCSC so you can kind of order parts

807
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:54,020
and pieces at the same time there's kind

808
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:56,540
of a nice thing and they just recently

809
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:59,600
started doing board assembly so you can

810
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,700
actually order the parts order the board

811
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,509
have them put them together ship them to

812
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,759
you fairly inexpensively but I think

813
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,650
they only do green PCBs and parts on one

814
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,570
side some restrictions there so I

815
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,030
haven't tried it out yet but inside it

816
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:16,010
too smart prototyping will do presumably

817
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:19,730
you ship them parts or give them a list

818
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,930
of parts to go by but that's that's

819
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,180
usually for much larger scale things

820
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:27,169
and then for prototypes I like to use

821
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:30,149
wash park there in the States and they

822
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:32,880
have one color option because the purple

823
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,230
board so it's usually if you see someone

824
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,830
with a purple board probably came from a

825
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,390
park and they only do the gold plating

826
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:43,230
but they'll let you order three copies

827
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:45,140
of a design for a couple of bucks get it

828
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,610
sent out to you in a couple weeks and

829
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,500
it's very good for testing out designs

830
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,080
without having to order three or five

831
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,720
hundred of thousand words and then

832
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,330
finding out get mistaken for all right

833
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,149
just add something oh Sh is open source

834
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:02,220
hardware and on their website you can

835
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,350
find other people's designs and they

836
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,680
welcome you to buy their designs and

837
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,500
it's shared among the community

838
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,810
there's a lot of little add-on printed

839
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,340
circuit boards on their website

840
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,920
yeah there's their great super cheap I

841
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,330
highly recommend they've done a lot for

842
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,330
the community I think it's four dollars

843
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:23,509
per square inch okay yeah yeah not not

844
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:27,950
expensive at all the others the others

845
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:29,360
tend to price things and brackets so if

846
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,129
something is 5 centimeters by 5

847
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,290
centimeters or smaller it's one price

848
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:38,750
once you move up to the next size board

849
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:42,350
just ten by ten it's another price the

850
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,180
OSH party does do the per square inch so

851
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:50,360
if you have a really tiny sign super

852
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:54,250
cheap so that's all I've got on slides

853
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,740
do you have any questions so when you

854
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,450
like say you're gonna print out a batch

855
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,720
would be more cost-effective to do a

856
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,160
bigger board and then do your design

857
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,459
across that board so that you just punch

858
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,170
it out when you get it or just say okay

859
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,850
I mean hey I know it's this dimensions

860
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,420
just send it out and say I want this

861
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:16,490
number so it depends the different PCB

862
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,160
manufacturers have different rules they

863
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,169
call it a panel is a tional so that's

864
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,029
putting one design in a big panel

865
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,160
shipping a panel out to you and then you

866
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,250
punch it out or it's mostly cut out and

867
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,930
you can break it away stuff like that

868
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,270
they have a couple of restrictions on

869
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,200
how you can analyze boards some of them

870
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:37,740
only do it where you can

871
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,240
he's there's a z-score bid that they use

872
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,520
that let's just kind of snap the board

873
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,350
doesn't leave a nice clean finish and if

874
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,600
you're doing a irregular shape that

875
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,610
doesn't really work so well but some of

876
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,310
them will let you route up the whole

877
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,860
board design except just leave a couple

878
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:57,029
of little attachment points that you can

879
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,860
break off and it can be cheaper if

880
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,090
you're making a lot of small things it

881
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,610
can make it a lot easier to assemble

882
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,140
them because you can put solder based on

883
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,170
all the paths of all the small things at

884
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,000
one big board chunk and then make 20

885
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,730
copies of a board at once it's effective

886
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
a symbol a tiny little pepperoni piece

887
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:18,690
and like on the money's but the drawback

888
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,430
there is that you don't get nice clean

889
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:23,280
edges around your words

890
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,910
so if you've ever had a piece of

891
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,960
electrons that's had sort of like I am a

892
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,100
little piece that kind of sticks out

893
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,770
that's a little sharp but yeah it looks

894
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,020
like a little like three that's because

895
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,850
they panelized it with if you don't

896
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,650
panelize it you get nice rounded edges

897
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:41,310
that are really smooth can't really cut

898
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:44,340
your hands so it's kind of a trade-off

899
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:46,860
there that you do for me I've never

900
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,960
really found it he's useful enough just

901
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,060
because artists tend to get cheaper when

902
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,160
they get smaller and parts tend to get

903
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,740
cheaper when you scale up the number so

904
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,569
if you are ordering ten boards cost this

905
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,979
much you're ordering 100 boards it'll

906
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:03,650
cost a little bit more so it can usually

907
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:06,410
you know kind of you say things are

908
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:08,960
getting there okay when you order your

909
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,190
boards do you have to specifically tell

910
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,230
them you want it like you're doing

911
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,579
surface otter mouth do you have to

912
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,180
specifically tell the manufacturers I

913
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:20,109
want a solder stencil included yeah so I

914
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:22,910
don't have any of my senses here but

915
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:25,430
those are used for putting together the

916
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,230
surface mount parts onto PCBs

917
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:30,440
it's basically a stainless-steel sheet

918
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,050
or mylar sheet with little holes cut out

919
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,300
that with the laser cutter that lets you

920
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:39,400
squeegee solder paste onto the boards

921
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,400
drop your parts on throwing the ir oven

922
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,720
all three of these companies well the

923
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:47,029
top two will definitely manufacture

924
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,029
estimates before you use stainless steel

925
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,970
Josh Park has a like a sister company

926
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,790
that I think it's called Austin tensile

927
00:41:52,970 --> 00:42:00,049
and they'll give you a stainless steel

928
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:03,529
of aware that a little mylar sheets or

929
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:05,000
just a little bit little bit extra cost

930
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,240
oh yeah those are this receipt for

931
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,160
helpful everybody together a lot of

932
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,990
boards I have have you done of picker

933
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,210
parts or pick you know picking place

934
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,549
with any of the manufacturers yet I've

935
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:23,090
done that with a smart prototyping and

936
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:25,160
some boards assembled by them it's

937
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:29,270
pretty complex period of doing just a

938
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,640
few smart prototyping they start in here

939
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,830
if you want to use the air pick and

940
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,720
place machine to put boards together you

941
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:39,759
have to have an 800 dollar minimum order

942
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,399
or assembly that's the sort of base cost

943
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,250
for that because it takes them a lot of

944
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:53,510
work and cycles to put the program

945
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:55,310
together have you heard of macro fab so

946
00:42:53,510 --> 00:43:00,500
they're they're like a small batch of

947
00:42:55,310 --> 00:43:02,210
pic parts okay if you if you so they

948
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,520
they have a list of all the parts that

949
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,740
they have that sit in their reels and if

950
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,020
you use their parts it actually becomes

951
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,509
cheaper then if you say I want these

952
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,009
specific parts they'll be like well now

953
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,380
we have to get the reels for these so

954
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,760
how about you just use our parts so they

955
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,340
have a list of parts and if you actually

956
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,630
build it all with theirs and they'll do

957
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,290
the pickle part for the whole damn thing

958
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,360
okay and they're kind of what jlc piece

959
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:28,759
PCB is just started down it's like if

960
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,250
you use their parts lesson will work for

961
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,510
you that's all I'm cheaper yeah so I

962
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,270
noticed like if you're doing a small

963
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,520
count it's more expensive per board but

964
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,080
the more you ramped up it's like all of

965
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,750
a sudden the cost per part starts

966
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,330
dropping drastically but and then you're

967
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,960
spending come yours and that's that's an

968
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,869
easy trap to fall into user

969
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,460
these PCBs you'll want to order a small

970
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,680
batch alike ten boards for example

971
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,859
because that sort of like usually promo

972
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,160
order quantity must use like aa spark

973
00:43:54,859 --> 00:44:01,259
and it'll be maybe 20 bucks to order 10

974
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,848
boards and then you'll see that little

975
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,119
little slider and you'll drag it up to a

976
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:06,809
hundred boards it'll be like 25 bucks

977
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,599
that's what it's worth

978
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,030
Underwood's right probably did it right

979
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,099
and then you drag that slider up to 500

980
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:16,200
boards and it's only like $40 my god

981
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,490
it's five times as many boards and you

982
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,899
can just sit there and read that slider

983
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,250
over and over and over again

984
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,069
you know before you know you're spending

985
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,680
six hundred bucks on PCBs that don't

986
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:28,290
work right yeah they get a double wire

987
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,669
so you gotta be careful uh that happens

988
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,859
with the boards that happens with the

989
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,559
parts of the components you're buying on

990
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:36,240
bouncer you buy one part it's ten cents

991
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,540
you buy 100 parts that are sitting up

992
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,919
nice so it's very easy to start picking

993
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,579
up all these things and you have bags

994
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,530
and bags resistors that you don't be

995
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:47,940
yeah it's so easy you just gotta you got

996
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,780
to be careful that'll be a little little

997
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,780
diligent about that

998
00:44:52,439 --> 00:45:00,819
you bitch yeah bitch that's Texas

999
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,559
Instruments this T is website you have

1000
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:05,288
the web manager power power designer

1001
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:10,959
yeah super useful tool highly recommend

1002
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:13,569
it it uses TI parts so you know just

1003
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:14,888
keep that in mind that's what that's

1004
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:19,779
what it's here for it's sell more of

1005
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:21,339
their parts but it relieves you a lot of

1006
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:23,529
mystery and unknown with electrical

1007
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:26,379
engineering design they can be an easy

1008
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:28,299
button for your power yep it's such an

1009
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:30,999
easy button and this is this one

1010
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:32,319
generated I think 17 different power

1011
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:35,499
supply designs that I could have picked

1012
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,729
for these three hours will let you dump

1013
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,279
that straight in the Chi cab

1014
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:41,948
dorky cat or do you have to recreate

1015
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:44,319
this in kicad I have recreated it I know

1016
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:45,909
there are some outputs or cut it either

1017
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,308
tools I don't know exactly what they are

1018
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:51,219
all right they're usually small enough

1019
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:56,169
it's only a couple parts I just rebuilt

1020
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:58,269
it I did look at their PCB layout output

1021
00:45:56,169 --> 00:46:00,788
and sort of based my design off that

1022
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:02,368
just because inductors have to be really

1023
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:04,359
close to the pads and all this stuff

1024
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:06,399
usually it doesn't matter a whole lot

1025
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:09,259
but just try to try to match what they

1026
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:12,359
give you this this should work

1027
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,730
sweet look to be a he had on call a

1028
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,990
while back and you know well it's pretty

1029
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,610
clear if you're making the main badge

1030
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,919
and you're making the add-on getting

1031
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:22,470
cool things with GP iOS and digital's

1032
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,780
but you're just making an add-on is

1033
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:26,700
there any sort of convention I mean is

1034
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,890
there a tiny signal and you do one that

1035
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,669
you should be a contender a or anything

1036
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,578
you should do

1037
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,539
there's it's it's really not a standard

1038
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:38,670
I call it let's do the same to standard

1039
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:42,000
yeah you know the things that you can

1040
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,890
rely on our power ground you do have

1041
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,740
this too high to see pens but even I

1042
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:50,009
spritzee the protocol doesn't tell you

1043
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:56,459
anything about the data so there's

1044
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:57,869
really not a whole lot maybe they'll

1045
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,480
change over the next couple years maybe

1046
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:04,920
you know a group of you know aspiring

1047
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:17,130
hackers can start to agree on work with

1048
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:19,980
stuff organize their volt unless like

1049
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:23,670
you said you're doing both sides so on

1050
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,859
the pizza boards there's a new prompt on

1051
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,430
each of the topics that identifies what

1052
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:31,890
the topping is and the board is designed

1053
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:34,019
to go read that so you can see which

1054
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,000
which support has much topping in it

1055
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:39,868
like I said just yell at you the

1056
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,799
pineapple on there alright now you said

1057
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:51,299
you problem know how big the data I want

1058
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:53,579
to say these words excited you can you

1059
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:55,980
can identify parts using just a couple

1060
00:47:53,579 --> 00:48:02,759
of resistors and measure the voltage

1061
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:04,980
across them of EEPROM how many boards

1062
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:06,809
that pineapple has been plugged into so

1063
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,150
so what is the interaction when you plug

1064
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,130
in a pineapple so it's the light at the

1065
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,809
top just to go nuts so right now it

1066
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:16,349
doesn't do much of anything okay

1067
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:19,750
yeah but the idea of these boards is

1068
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:21,160
that they've got Wi-Fi and so

1069
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,930
build a couple of different puzzles and

1070
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,250
games for you to play on the court and

1071
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:28,600
then there's gonna be a leaderboard

1072
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:31,450
where past you know the sort of gates in

1073
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,580
the games would upload your score up to

1074
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,350
like a leaderboard and your avatar would

1075
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,680
be your selection of toppings we put on

1076
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:40,569
the board be like oh that's the guy with

1077
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,730
all the pineapples on his pizza give I

1078
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,800
see you first with the head you just

1079
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,990
just kind of like a silly little little

1080
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:56,710
thing there but yeah it's mostly mostly

1081
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:58,000
visual okay you know the boards how much

1082
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:04,150
you looking to sell those for at defcon

1083
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:12,220
uh probably probably $45 not very

1084
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:20,680
expensive but these will come in a nice

1085
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:22,899
little silk screen this one just just to

1086
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,770
come a couple little fun things it's

1087
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,770
just mean what you can do

1088
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,850
yes

1089
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,580
what's your favorite medium to be

1090
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,860
contacted on you can reach me on Twitter

1091
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:42,350
at Tyler Crompton that's probably the

1092
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:50,360
easiest one you can also email me typed

1093
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:52,940
in that gmail.com yeah if you have any

1094
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:56,360
questions about PCB design please please

1095
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:59,030
let me know and I can help you get get

1096
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,820
through your first one especially get

1097
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:05,690
stuck in somewhere with the electronic

1098
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,370
design article trying to figure out how

1099
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,940
to get some of these color options that

1100
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:14,089
are on the little swatches that's

1101
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,230
alright it's a lot to sort of think

1102
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,300
about when you're in the design tool

1103
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,700
like multi layers because the design

1104
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,750
tool is just a flat 2d design so when

1105
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,080
you're trying to figure out how to get

1106
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:26,390
these different colors which is why I

1107
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,400
made these could just have it in my hand

1108
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:33,080
and see them here's this is how you get

1109
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,760
this color did everyone get the color

1110
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,109
swatches if you didn't get one please

1111
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:41,589
please come up and grab one

1112
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:44,740
they look anything else new ee I I'm a

1113
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:49,480
computer engineer so it a little bit of

1114
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:54,220
EE but mostly software so I had a little

1115
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,839
bit of background the college but most

1116
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,959
of this I learned just just from doing

1117
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,910
that just having fun that's why I don't

1118
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,599
design my own power supply so just let

1119
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:10,529
the tool do it for me yeah you don't

1120
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:10,530
have to be a W thanks
