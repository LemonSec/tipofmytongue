1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:12,059
welcome to his first session freaking

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:19,549
afternoon time my journey and getting

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,549
close every my name is Mark Brody

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,039
and you have any comments questions

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:32,710
outside session I reach a media frenzy

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:36,550
do you know that count I I just if you

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,100
read my file on partnering I'm currently

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,379
working on my talk I'm going to talk

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,360
about a lot of my past working

10
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,849
experience I'm currently working with

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,949
with a company called trance and we're

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,320
building a web off web native operating

13
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,239
system so that's what I'm currently

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,780
working on and a lot of my time

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,780
management has been going into into that

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,880
but I guess getting started several

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,340
years ago I read a Forbes article and

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,610
that Forbes article claimed that

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,910
billionaires have their schedules timed

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,039
down to five minute increments so they

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:22,270
know every five minutes of every day

22
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:24,039
what they're gonna be doing now that I'm

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,250
about five years removed from that

24
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:32,290
article I went back looking for it but I

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:36,970
couldn't find it and now that I have

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:40,299
gone down my journey of tracking my time

27
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,900
very minutely it's surprising to me that

28
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:46,329
they that they reported five minutes but

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,090
Forbes apparently has been putting out

30
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,729
they have a columnist that just puts out

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,950
this is what billionaires do about every

32
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,840
month they have a new column you know

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,280
you want to be a billionaire do these

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,020
things

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,110
so I thought it might be cool to be a

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,469
billionaire so I built a spreadsheet to

37
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:08,090
track my time this is my first

38
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,288
spreadsheet

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,350
instead of doing five minute increments

40
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,609
I thought I'd start with 15 minute

41
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,340
increments

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,040
especially since when you're billing the

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,810
spreadsheet there's only enough room on

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,970
a front back piece of paper to have the

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,150
15-minute increments for a 24 hour

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,000
period and so I would print out this

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,920
sheet every day blow it up stick in my

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,180
pocket so be portable to take it to work

49
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,089
pull it out and I tracked my time every

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,430
15 minutes what I planned to do for the

51
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:53,220
next 15 minutes and what I actually did

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:54,840
for the 15 minutes right and what I one

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,100
thing I found I was trying to 50 minutes

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:03,000
these are the five of course but what I

55
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,190
noticed was what I plan to do was always

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,300
trumped by what I actually currently

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,880
needed to do so planning you know 15

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,890
minutes ahead I kept getting derail

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,690
things I wasn't expected but I was I did

60
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,570
start to notice some patterns on how my

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,799
time was spent and wasted when I go back

62
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,799
and was it that she every day

63
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,880
however analyzing my time this way it

64
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,459
was extremely cumbersome as every 15

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,859
minutes I'm distracted or writing

66
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:39,400
something or she so how many people are

67
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,080
here at least year

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,890
a bunch of people so when I first

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,110
started at the place I was working on

70
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,250
working out at this time it was kind of

71
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:57,459
a wild west I'm a software developer and

72
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,120
they pretty much said hey anything goes

73
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:04,120
we had deeply for source control we have

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,690
people using subversion yet a team

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,120
foundation server and visual sourcesafe

76
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,280
so it was whatever you wanted to use for

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,440
whatever tool would you want you know

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,209
use it for you can even write your

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,488
programs in any programming language you

80
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,168
wanted to but if you ever wanted to hand

81
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:23,500
it off to another developer they got a

82
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:27,669
writer for fusil was the rules of paddle

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,410
won't work and so people would would

84
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:34,120
write in any language they'd do anything

85
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:37,240
and after the first year I was there

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,210
they started tightening that up and and

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,699
the task tracking that everyone used at

88
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,919
that point was I used email other people

89
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,889
use text files and it was just kind of

90
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,109
haphazard so they created a project

91
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:54,450
management team for the first time and

92
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,450
then they all mandated that we used to

93
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,360
so in JIRA many many of you know you can

94
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,880
create simple tasks place those tasks

95
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,130
and do a sprint and then he's work on

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,729
those tasks you can move them across the

97
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:14,050
convo for everyone here know what a con

98
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:20,169
sophomore it is No okay

99
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:22,930
Kanban board is a it's kind of this if

100
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,380
this virtual light is its columns

101
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,710
they're their columns typically you'll

102
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,940
have the first column will be will say

103
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,878
something like your backlog of tasks

104
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,679
that you have for that sprint

105
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,229
and then the next column will say in

106
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:43,498
progress and then the next column will

107
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,149
say maybe testing and then you'll have

108
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:49,050
the final column that says the dumpee

109
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:52,379
you've been pleated that tax and so as

110
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,589
you work your tasks remove them to each

111
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,149
column to show where they're at in the

112
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,689
process of getting today

113
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:04,199
now the cool fun thing about JIRA and

114
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:05,550
having that compound board is that when

115
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,550
you move that you take your mouse and

116
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,439
move that task into each position

117
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,689
especially when you're moving into the

118
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,879
done stomach you get this happy chemical

119
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,069
in your brain

120
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:20,279
oh I just finished I completed a task

121
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:22,679
and I feel energized when I do that and

122
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,080
then I want to do another test

123
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:29,339
yeah because I'm seeing progress moving

124
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,099
across the board so as far as I was

125
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,539
concerned zero is the bee's knees for

126
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,878
that kind of thing I wanted to have it

127
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:38,369
home I was like how can I get this tool

128
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,419
so that I can put all of my daily tasks

129
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:44,550
on my home tasks into a backlog and then

130
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,109
I can have a compound board feel this

131
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,069
good feeling when I'm doing household

132
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,019
stuff but it costs five twenty dollars

133
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,740
per year and that is just a little too

134
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:58,319
rich for me it's only ten dollars to

135
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,669
build your own local server and so I

136
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,909
tried that and their documentation

137
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:10,019
little laughing support little lacking

138
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:13,339
but you can do it and I eventually did I

139
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,869
was able to build a an instance of it

140
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:20,999
it's not ultimately what I use right now

141
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:24,629
but but it's it's a way you can go once

142
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:27,209
you've built it once you've done it once

143
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:30,490
you learn all the ways you wish you have

144
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:33,759
done it correctly and so

145
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,600
I would recommend if you could you build

146
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:42,389
that install be ready to tear it down

147
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,889
and start over so you can build it right

148
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:49,479
but all I really wanted was a Kanban

149
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:51,880
board now that's that's it I just needed

150
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:56,199
to keep track of tasks I need to

151
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,180
complete and most importantly I wanted I

152
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,979
needed a way to release all those happy

153
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,120
chemicals to keep me motivated to work

154
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:07,539
on the next task so I looked for open

155
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,020
source solutions there were some out

156
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,479
there

157
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,039
they weren't very well supported someone

158
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,630
had written you know basically written

159
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,509
their own tool that they wanted to use

160
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:20,440
and then abandon the project for the

161
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:23,680
most part Kanban boards and these tools

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,669
they usually have to thought often had

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,650
to be added using apply and so that was

164
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:33,399
difficult to get the my installed would

165
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,949
work properly with the tool and another

166
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,570
thing that happened around this time was

167
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:43,570
PHP seven God adopted as the you know

168
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,060
you must use this for the Ubuntu

169
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:52,120
distribution which is what I was using

170
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:54,609
at the time linens and PHP five was the

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,829
language that most of these project

172
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,370
management software packages were

173
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:04,029
written so either you had to rewrite the

174
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:08,079
whole thing for PHP seven which no one

175
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:10,390
was going to do for you so you'd have to

176
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,349
do that on your own or you just just

177
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,350
didn't use it

178
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,860
so I had this idea or what about the

179
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,730
extension for file system you can pretty

180
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,300
much write a file name and pretty much

181
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,210
most any character you want to use and

182
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:34,319
so that could be your task name and then

183
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,850
if it's a text file you can stick you

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,760
can stick the description of the task

185
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,730
right into the text file if it's a zip

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,689
file it's like having an attachment you

187
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:49,320
can just stick any file into that zip

188
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:53,370
archive that compresses you when he is

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,650
tar going to use GZ whatever it is the

190
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,360
compression archive you just stick any

191
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:02,160
file in there and it's like having an

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,470
attachment going to the task and so

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,890
turns out a simple file system file

194
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,210
directory database this can be used to

195
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:15,930
track fast so I used the common file

196
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:23,070
explorer to create a poor-man's compound

197
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:26,160
and so what I kind of wound up with was

198
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:32,010
something like this I said okay right

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,530
now I need to present a fragment 23 so

200
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:39,540
that's a progress right now so I can

201
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:48,709
move that into my own progress and so I

202
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:52,839
set up a raspberry pi 2 to do that

203
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:56,450
and and I still I had all my buckets on

204
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,670
the monitor with I arranged my windows

205
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,460
so that it would all create a compound

206
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,640
fort and then I had in the background

207
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,190
bash spritz running to do all the heavy

208
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,980
lifting back and stuff that Jared would

209
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,290
be done but it was all custom and I

210
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,660
could set it up to do it the way I

211
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,490
wanted to do and that worked really

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,380
great for for a long time but what

213
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,400
happened what happened the time track -

214
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:29,300
this talks about a time track we got off

215
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,130
on a project management all these

216
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,620
project management solutions help them

217
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,930
keep track of tasks the thing you're the

218
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,600
things you need to get done none of them

219
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,489
adequately track your time there's a

220
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,440
limited resource required to get those

221
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:48,020
constant so project managers everywhere

222
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,430
will pretend but you can track time in

223
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:55,640
JIRA every project manager I've ever had

224
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,729
is asked me to track my time and project

225
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,620
in their project management software

226
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,840
they asked me to estimate the time on

227
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,370
the front of them it will take for me to

228
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,320
complete the task then when I tell them

229
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,810
how much time is come take they tell me

230
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,850
I'm full of it and they want to reduce

231
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,329
that time estimate can they go on and

232
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,040
tell me this is your real time mister

233
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:23,570
then they ask me to track the real time

234
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,209
it took me to complete that task then

235
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:30,610
they get upset that the real time the

236
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:33,610
completion is longer than their estimate

237
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,610
so

238
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,839
so you know when you get down to it you

239
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:44,379
know the JIRA is really just about how

240
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:48,790
much time did I think do I think I'm

241
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:50,860
going to take and and it's almost I

242
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,118
guess maybe it's some people in here

243
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,040
done planning punker

244
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:57,220
it's almost like you're kind of gambling

245
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,689
and making a deal with the project

246
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,769
management team and and there's a lot of

247
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:07,389
non truths going you know it it's kind

248
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:10,449
of like what I think of it's not like

249
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:14,889
her and it's it's very easy to couch the

250
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:17,498
numbers and not think about in reality

251
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:23,470
how much time is actually being spent

252
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:25,149
and being real about that so I love the

253
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,970
company I was working for that when I

254
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,749
started this whole time journey and I

255
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,579
started working for a web agency and

256
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:36,970
they wanted me to track every minute

257
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:40,689
every project of every client I was

258
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,569
working on so they could bill and if I

259
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:46,059
worked you know for minutes and seconds

260
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:49,089
for a particular client that could build

261
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:52,959
that straight to that clock with one to

262
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:56,889
one time though if I worked on a project

263
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,979
I said I would I would actually keep

264
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,139
track of you know this is the crime I'm

265
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,589
working on this is how long it took to

266
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:08,870
work on it and this is what I was doing

267
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:12,980
so I was encouraged to use their tools

268
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:16,790
fresh books and toggle will do this for

269
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,820
you their weapons they work in a web

270
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,819
browser

271
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:28,959
problem with that is whenever I'm doing

272
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,940
web development I have a tab and so

273
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:37,000
fresh books and toggle are just another

274
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,000
browser tab so

275
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:46,450
Google Chrome likes to eat at on memory

276
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,180
and what would what would happen to me

277
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,960
so I have all these browser tabs open I

278
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,609
do

279
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:56,860
really focused on what I'm doing I get

280
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,530
this level where Google Chrome starts

281
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,840
kind of acting up because it's viewing a

282
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:05,260
lot of system resources and I need to

283
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,260
kill something so that it all kind of

284
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,450
comes back and works again so what's the

285
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,069
easiest thing to kill well Google Chrome

286
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,260
because it's eating all their system

287
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,780
resources to bring it back up is this

288
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,430
the thing that says not responding and I

289
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,900
was always wondering if I could trust my

290
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,849
time that's big tracked and in Google

291
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,250
Chrome because the same not responding

292
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:32,080
the whole time I'm trying to track the

293
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:34,150
time and so I I wasn't really much of a

294
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,390
fan for this for this method of time

295
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,780
tracking once you know my system as a

296
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:44,770
developer started getting overloaded so

297
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:51,329
I started using my trusty Samsung clock

298
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:54,510
app so it has an excellent stopwatch on

299
00:15:51,330 --> 00:16:01,300
with a one-click of

300
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:05,590
I can just start time and then when it a

301
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,569
task is done or put on hold and I moved

302
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,020
to a different task I just press a

303
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:18,460
button and it starts the next time that

304
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:22,540
keeps track of each time hey and so once

305
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:29,470
I figured out I could do that

306
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:33,790
I got myself a little red tumbler and I

307
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:37,860
just started timing everything not just

308
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:41,650
the clients work but everything and I

309
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:46,050
would put red stars next to everything I

310
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:49,480
could bill to the web agency and

311
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,520
everything else was for my own

312
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,340
information of what was going on in my

313
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,110
life and I could see you know how much

314
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,110
time I was spending on everything so

315
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,070
this worked really well for getting my

316
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:12,640
timesheet in a heavily and reporting my

317
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,710
time and getting invoicing as a

318
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,820
contractor invoicing the web agency

319
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:20,680
ain't getting paid it also had good uses

320
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,770
for figuring out exactly how much time I

321
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:27,400
was spending doing routine daily actions

322
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,580
it was it's kind of interesting to me

323
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,160
that before I start doing this I thought

324
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,110
just about everything every place I

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,820
needed to get to you by car in my town

326
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,620
was about 15 minutes away and so you

327
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,850
know what I'll see you 15 minutes well I

328
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,510
only need to plan for 15 minutes too

329
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,250
from bearded there and what I found out

330
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,280
is well some places they're only ten

331
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,980
minutes away at some place and I'll get

332
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,690
there early and some places are 20

333
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,660
minutes away and I'm going to always be

334
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,780
late and I realized how stressed out I

335
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,170
get when I try to go to the 20 minute

336
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:08,480
places because I wasn't you know I was

337
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,000
always like I wasn't thinking about the

338
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,400
actual time spent to do all that so it

339
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,760
helped me see and what what was I

340
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,260
actually doing versus what I thought was

341
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,820
estimating I was down but it was a

342
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,300
complete waste of time for making

343
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,730
projections or making schedule changes

344
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,590
based on the aggregate of what I bring

345
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,060
it down

346
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:35,120
problem was that's where all data

347
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,330
collected in a notebook so it cannot be

348
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,949
easily parsed and analyzed and I and I

349
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,050
would be a waste of time to then just

350
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:48,050
like okay now I've got the data like

351
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:52,850
just punch it into the computer around

352
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:56,030
this time I started having extreme

353
00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:01,730
anxiety I've had panic attacks insomnia

354
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:04,879
or and I found out through a whole lot

355
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,040
of process of elimination and recording

356
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,070
using this time book I found out that if

357
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,830
I worked out at the gym 12 hours a week

358
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:15,250
I could eliminate most of my anxieties

359
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,330
symptoms and get a good night's sleep

360
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:25,760
consistent and so I realized somehow I

361
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:28,399
need to push myself and track in such a

362
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,670
way that I can consistently squeeze is

363
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,620
12 hours I'd have to plan to get it you

364
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,990
know to be able to do it but I was gonna

365
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,360
squeeze 12 hours a week into my schedule

366
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:43,490
to work out because it was a very

367
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:46,490
important that I do so and so I decide I

368
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:50,480
need to build a time tracking app

369
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,450
that solves my two primary time traffic

370
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,799
problems the first is how can I not

371
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:00,309
spend too much time on one task such as

372
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,470
co-development if I'm in the zone

373
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,720
you know I'm too focused on

374
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,090
co-development I forget that I need to

375
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,720
do laundry you know that kind of that

376
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,480
kind of thing to the exclusion of you

377
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,869
know focus on one task to the exclusion

378
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,509
of other important ones and then the

379
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:23,959
second problem was how can I distribute

380
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:26,090
enough time everything that I want to

381
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,720
focus on during my week so I don't miss

382
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,590
it so I don't look back and go oh shoot

383
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,090
hi I wanted to spend more time on that

384
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:41,178
but I forgot about it because of this

385
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:43,309
other thing that distracted me so you

386
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,139
know if we look at the problem set at

387
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,440
this moment in time I had a simple

388
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:50,269
backlog that all my password just dumped

389
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,330
into you know so if there's something I

390
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:56,240
need to do but make a task and my task

391
00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:00,980
tracking system extension of for call

392
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,169
system just throw it in the back and in

393
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,629
my philosophy was well if I just get

394
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,690
busy I could get everything done

395
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,340
eventually I just get cracking yeah then

396
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,049
there's a finite number of tasks right

397
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,559
done merits at ten thousand there

398
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:18,240
eventually I'll get done it was too easy

399
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:23,129
to choose easy

400
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,679
pass from the back wall and I miss all

401
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,950
the hard stone I'd never get around at

402
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,620
the complex things the more I would do a

403
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,190
routine task before I would choose to do

404
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:38,040
a similar task to that routine things so

405
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,170
for example after complaining a cleaning

406
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,740
task if I was doing cleaning in my house

407
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:46,350
I would notice all other plans

408
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,780
and so as soon as I was done with that

409
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,699
first task and I need to move on to

410
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,420
another task I'd have cleaning all my

411
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,510
life and so the chances that the next

412
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,540
task would be cleaning or very hot and

413
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,330
I'm like go a day just doing cleaning

414
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,730
the end of a week the whole house would

415
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,460
look great but I hadn't written any code

416
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,940
that week which is a bad thing when

417
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,280
you're a software though

418
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,050
so I created these focus categories so

419
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,080
these are the things I want to focus on

420
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:22,470
in my life I want to I want to make sure

421
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,419
my myspace is clean you know everything

422
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,630
you know I need to do enough cleaning

423
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:34,260
that I've got clean space I need to

424
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:38,340
develop so I need to write this is not

425
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,010
just writing code this is doing things

426
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,250
that help the future future me future

427
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,780
more these are these are things where I

428
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,970
create them you know

429
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm creating things for myself for

430
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:56,600
others it's writing an author it's it's

431
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,600
anything that that creates

432
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:05,780
engineering you know Bobby's exercise I

433
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:10,170
needed that in 12 hours a week that

434
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:13,550
learning I wanted to read a chapter of a

435
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:16,440
book every day and have some complex

436
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,720
thoughts on it so I can build my

437
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,320
knowledge organization and one of my

438
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,130
life to be more organized

439
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,500
so I could nom I can do things more

440
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:32,020
efficiently published deploy this is I

441
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,730
wanted to whatever I developed a certain

442
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,860
subset of that that I thought we were

443
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,640
ready and polished I wanted to share

444
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,040
with the world so whatever I written any

445
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,190
code that I had completed where I had a

446
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,770
finished software from from it I want

447
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,530
you know this category is I need to take

448
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:53,050
time to get it out there so other people

449
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,690
can use it and I can share with other

450
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,810
people relationships

451
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,490
I like this set aside time I'm spending

452
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,740
time with families spend time with my

453
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:10,210
friends and having an active member my

454
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:12,340
spirituality I wanted to take time to

455
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:17,830
practice spiritual disciplines of

456
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:23,590
meditation I try to I'm a member of a

457
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:28,030
church in my local community and I try

458
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:31,480
to be active and in that church and and

459
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,250
I try to read scripture every day those

460
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,060
are things that were important to me

461
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:40,150
that I want to put in my scheduling and

462
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:44,190
that's sleep I need to get out asleep

463
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:46,720
and you know I do

464
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,770
once I started tracking this leaders

465
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,420
amazing to me

466
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:53,490
once I actually started getting the

467
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:58,300
sleep how much better my life become so

468
00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:00,790
I set up a time management plan said I'm

469
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,550
gonna spend one hour per day in each

470
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,010
category when possible for a total of

471
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:09,100
six hours per week for dental work

472
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,030
I was going to get eight hours of sleep

473
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,159
per night and play catch up wherever

474
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:18,010
necessary so if I was laughing in one

475
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,300
area the day prior I was going to make

476
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:25,379
up for it

477
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:28,230
and my goal was to reach a total working

478
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:33,050
comment on all of my tasks a 60 hours

479
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:36,480
totally so this is my time tracking app

480
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,340
and I've got a dashboard so as you can

481
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,120
see I spent a lot of time developing

482
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:47,220
code and more than six hours to leave

483
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:51,209
and so it turn turn a great but I didn't

484
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:54,540
spend six hours cleaning or exercise so

485
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:57,150
those are red and so I've got I've got

486
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,300
the the time tracking application saying

487
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:03,240
hey you know you didn't you didn't get

488
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:07,260
enough sleep it's red you better work on

489
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:13,020
and so if I see red it please me in

490
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:16,310
that's something I need to address so if

491
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,280
you're interested this time tracker I

492
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:23,629
published a version of it up on github

493
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:27,629
that if you want you can download a

494
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,450
licensed is gplv3 it's a there's a

495
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,030
vagrant file that's built in with it so

496
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:36,890
here if you're familiar with vagrant you

497
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:41,100
just download vagrant tool and then you

498
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,990
get it get inside a terminal where the

499
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,219
code is and we'll just type in favor huh

500
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:50,570
and it creates a Ubuntu box within your

501
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,959
[Music]

502
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:56,448
a VirtualBox within that directory

503
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:58,849
essentially and starts up so the web

504
00:26:56,449 --> 00:27:01,759
server or you can just set up the web

505
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:03,519
server to use it like I've got at home

506
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,779
I've got a running out of a Raspberry Pi

507
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:11,629
it's it's very low low system

508
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:15,709
requirements its default user

509
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,859
credentials for admin time tracker I'm

510
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:23,269
gonna post these slides up on this

511
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:30,079
github repo after after this session so

512
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:32,329
anyone who wants it so yeah like I said

513
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,149
I've got this application running at my

514
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:40,879
house my Raspberry Pi it's on my home

515
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:46,939
network so one warning the the security

516
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:51,589
I don't have any SSL certs you know or

517
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:53,929
anything like that on the time traffic

518
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:57,019
so it's not like ready for primetime to

519
00:27:53,929 --> 00:28:00,079
be pushed out to fraud a fraud

520
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:01,699
environment but running a like a home

521
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,859
network seems to work

522
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:07,959
i I'm comfortable with the level

523
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:11,359
security I set in the Postgres database

524
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:15,229
it encrypts all passwords that get

525
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:18,289
created with it using Blowfish so you're

526
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:22,869
not gonna have any plaintext passwords

527
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:22,869
getting stored on your local service

528
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:32,250
but I had yes so my time tracker worked

529
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:35,889
great for helping me balance my week

530
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:41,670
across all of my categories I got really

531
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:44,860
good at four months of making everything

532
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,380
and I was getting good sleep I was

533
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,879
getting kind of quit exercise I was

534
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:54,700
getting things turned green

535
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:58,480
it seemed wonderful but I found out this

536
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:02,740
was kind of good itch because I was

537
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:08,110
making frustratingly slow progress very

538
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:10,870
important front in each focus area so

539
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:13,600
for example and the organization

540
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,780
category I was trying to set up a home

541
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:23,199
library catalog I've got a lot of books

542
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:24,910
and 1,500 books and I thought you know I

543
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,280
always kind of thought that librarians

544
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,680
have a good gig you know they just sit

545
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,250
around all day and you know well here's

546
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,740
a book lets punch it into the computer

547
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:39,070
just kind of slowly going and sorted and

548
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,820
my idea was most of the time they spent

549
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,409
doing anything what had to be negligible

550
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,020
what did they actually do well when I

551
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:50,020
got into just my small amount of books

552
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,600
compared to the big library it's just 15

553
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:56,800
other books working on it for one hour

554
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,500
per day only six hours per week three

555
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,870
months later I'm not done oh yeah

556
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,410
I've probably put about 80 hours into it

557
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,719
so far which to me you know starting out

558
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,390
that that's insane you know I wouldn't

559
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,870
have expected that that's the case but I

560
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,880
haven't I haven't really been screwing

561
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,050
around with it you know I've got I've

562
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,030
been a thot equate time

563
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:23,210
every little piece of it and it's it's

564
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:31,399
taking me time to do these things that I

565
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:34,160
thought it was and so you know as as

566
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,710
part of my learning category I read two

567
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,990
books has kind of helped me further

568
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,700
along on my time tracking journey the

569
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:44,240
first one is essential in this

570
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:47,000
disciplined pursuit of less by Greg

571
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,400
McKeown and the other one was how to

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,150
fail at almost everything is still in

573
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:58,430
big Scott happens is the guy here is

574
00:30:53,150 --> 00:31:01,100
Dilbert so helpful takeaways from these

575
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:05,320
books first one it was good

576
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:08,959
McCallum builds this book essentialism

577
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,320
for those it's it's a book for those who

578
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,660
feel like they're just moving an inch

579
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:19,760
every direction at once but they're not

580
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:23,000
actually going that was me at this

581
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,460
moment I was a jacket focusing on the

582
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,370
little things and getting all this

583
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:35,060
things to regret but I was not a

584
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:37,939
masterfully accomplishing any and it's

585
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:41,080
from essentialism that came up with a

586
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:46,910
new method of task by word sensation I

587
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:52,159
started every day I start i take an

588
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:53,260
index card and and i write out the

589
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,390
essential things i knew

590
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:59,320
do that though but I also kept the task

591
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:03,910
books I got task book here that has all

592
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:08,169
my tasks each page is a project each

593
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:11,550
line is a task the task and so I've got

594
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:15,960
the pages number and the lines though

595
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:19,960
the category I'm putting my time tracker

596
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:23,340
and so every day I go through my backlog

597
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:27,910
and figure out ok what what are the

598
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:32,439
eight tasks they're most important most

599
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:34,570
urgent for me to get done right now what

600
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,860
are the things I need to do that I want

601
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:41,280
to accomplish that I needed to

602
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:45,850
accomplish soon maybe even today and

603
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:48,610
there are 10 lines on index card so I

604
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:53,260
just still an 8 there are 2 left over

605
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:55,740
and so if something pops up unexpected

606
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,230
I'll squeeze it into one of those

607
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,770
additional wines but if the third thing

608
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:06,390
pops up well then obviously I'm not I'm

609
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:08,760
not attracted on task that's too many

610
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,500
things I've got a reward time so I

611
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,500
generally when that third thing comes up

612
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,410
I had negotiated say is that really what

613
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,170
I need to be doing today I just try to

614
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:25,679
get rid of it I only focus on what's on

615
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:28,020
my cart so I locked down I walked down

616
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,530
my essentials daily essentials Park I

617
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:35,700
only focus on those times so this is an

618
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:39,300
example of one of the cards so this is

619
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:43,800
from yesterday actually so yeah I needed

620
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:46,620
to pack for Freaknik I needed to get a

621
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:52,320
tire rotation before I could drive here

622
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:55,830
and Selectric drove here and every time

623
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,570
I write done to the side of one of these

624
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,600
it gives me a little bit of the same

625
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:04,559
kind brain chemical spike that moving

626
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,740
that task across them across the

627
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,279
compound for us now this is my paper

628
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,659
prototype so eventually I want to I want

629
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,609
to add this into a contract around

630
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,460
because that would be a whole lot easier

631
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:23,879
than keeping track of an index card and

632
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,830
a notebook but doing the index part of

633
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,000
the notebook actually still works pretty

634
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,310
well one thing I did notice when I've

635
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,619
been using this equipment is there some

636
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,690
tasks that just take a long time and

637
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,590
might stretch over the days because

638
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,840
they're so big and complex and so for

639
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,330
those when I'll sometimes do instead of

640
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,480
writing done because it's not

641
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:51,080
done but I need to feel like I've

642
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,270
actually made progress on it too to move

643
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,880
forward and do not get discouraged from

644
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,640
people keeping working on it I'll put

645
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,370
the number of hours that I've worked on

646
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,480
I'll say yeah well I put in an hour on

647
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:08,930
that really long task today I'll put one

648
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,150
out and so that that concludes my brain

649
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,710
ad know you're actually working like

650
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:16,700
you're a genetic progress

651
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:22,670
don't don't sweat it just keep going and

652
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:26,000
so that's helped me a lot so also in

653
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:29,330
essentialism account emphasizes the

654
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,560
importance of daily play in building

655
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:35,170
mental connections and brain classes

656
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,060
this is something that you know I always

657
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,920
you know as I was doing a lot of this

658
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,799
time tracking I'm like I don't have time

659
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,110
to play video games I don't have time to

660
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,440
have fun I've got I've got to get down

661
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:52,190
to business and get these things done I

662
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:57,920
said I told myself I wanted to

663
00:35:52,190 --> 00:36:01,970
accomplish but it turns out because the

664
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,820
science and essentialism that cited in

665
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,200
that book is the plays important it

666
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,410
actually helps you connect all those

667
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,770
things together and if you're not

668
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:16,220
getting one hour a day according to the

669
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:20,270
book you're suffering and so I had to

670
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:22,850
play on the my dashboard and so now it

671
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,380
it turns red at me

672
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,750
so you're not playing enough video games

673
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:31,040
or you're not you're not getting out

674
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:35,090
enough and and you know playing

675
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,920
volleyball you know whatever I need to I

676
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:40,070
need to get out there play tennis I need

677
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,110
to do something that's that's fun and

678
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:47,060
that I'm just being playful

679
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:49,190
and I'm not thinking about I'm not

680
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:55,070
thinking about just just completing the

681
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:58,490
task and then there's how to fail at

682
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,950
almost everything is still one bit

683
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,890
it's got Adams premise in this book is

684
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,230
that we're all moist biological

685
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:09,100
computers that can be programmed and

686
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,100
that sounds great to me

687
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,839
there's not like programming computers

688
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:17,630
and if I can tweak himself that's really

689
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,830
that's really great so he talks about

690
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,750
how he focused his mind by the use of

691
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:27,080
affirmations specifically he broke down

692
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,420
and heard he didn't write I think in the

693
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,290
books he says he wrote down and he said

694
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:38,090
out loud to himself for years i scott

695
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:39,710
adams will be a famous party he knew he

696
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,080
says in his book he wasn't a good

697
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,720
cartoonist he knew he probably could

698
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,040
never be different things but he said he

699
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,790
was going to make sure he was a famous

700
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,710
writer and and he said that over and

701
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:56,060
over again to himself for years and

702
00:37:51,710 --> 00:38:01,240
before Dilbert became big and was his

703
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,240
voice and his program himself together

704
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:08,110
so Skylands is not the first author I've

705
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,820
read that have said that this that

706
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:13,270
affirmations can be used and they could

707
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:19,240
be powerful the program program dear

708
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:22,480
mark the other places I've read so that

709
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:27,899
they can be verbalized written down or

710
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:32,340
simply read eyesight I've I found it

711
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:39,400
helpful to do all three at the same time

712
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:41,710
so and end I've read that affirmations

713
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,470
are best absorb just by going to sleep

714
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:48,960
so that's what I do when I set up my

715
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:54,509
affirmations so my affirmation you know

716
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:58,950
one of them is I mark frazie want to be

717
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:05,230
or I'm Martin from Z will be a

718
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:08,950
successful and so I write that down

719
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:12,730
every night say it out loud before I go

720
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:15,430
to sleep those who effectively use

721
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,110
affirmations Scott Adams equip make it

722
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,529
clear that this is a mountain hatchet

723
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:23,830
it's just focused it's it's programming

724
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,900
that helps the brain focus so before I

725
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,299
go to bed each night take a piece I

726
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,760
actually my routine is I take a piece of

727
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,990
notebook paper and make a list of all

728
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:38,470
the positive things that happens and

729
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:40,660
then I write my affirmations at the

730
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,060
bottom of that list the good things that

731
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,790
I want to talk is on the things I want

732
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:50,160
to be in the direction I want to go and

733
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,160
then I go to sleep on all good stuff

734
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,319
I feel like this is way more effective

735
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,260
than for his sleep on my default

736
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:01,710
thoughts from the blah day or even worse

737
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:06,539
negative sign creep up in my head that

738
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:08,190
especially the anxiousness so I feel

739
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,559
like affirmations and listing out the

740
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,319
positives of each day are probably the

741
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:19,440
best give like the best gift I can get

742
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:21,569
to my future self Scott Adams also said

743
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,390
that he believes that time management is

744
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:30,380
not really as important as energy manage

745
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:37,038
some tasks are easier to do anymore

746
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,039
for me code development is best done it

747
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,460
for some reason

748
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,559
you know once it once it becomes dark

749
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,049
outside you know it's about 10 o'clock

750
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,289
at night I'm in the zone I can write

751
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:51,809
code until fourth warmth but if it's

752
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:54,480
first thing in the morning I'm dragon

753
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:57,390
you know it's I'm not a morning person

754
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm thinking about complex things early

755
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,109
in the morning this is tops so early in

756
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,000
the morning I'd rather be doing laundry

757
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:06,450
yeah because I don't have to think about

758
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,680
it as hard and so managing my energy

759
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:12,960
around the clock might be more effective

760
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,038
instead of designing pay the kind of

761
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,349
tasks it's taught you know I want to get

762
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:24,869
this code for it so I'm gonna make

763
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:26,880
myself focus and do it so his advice is

764
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:29,609
to optimize the amount of energy full

765
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,150
energy you have whenever possible so we

766
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:35,819
know good sleep good exercise eating

767
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,910
healthy all the things you can do to

768
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:42,859
increase your flow of energy to be more

769
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,859
efficient with your clever

770
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:52,559
so what's next for me on my turn now

771
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,779
that I've been doing all this time and

772
00:41:52,559 --> 00:42:05,160
project tracking and affirmations for

773
00:41:54,779 --> 00:42:07,140
years Maya billionaire yet nope yeah one

774
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,339
thing I will say is it's easy to fall

775
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:14,730
off the line I have experienced how easy

776
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,279
easy that is to do over time and when I

777
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:21,930
started doing this it was it was eating

778
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:25,309
to miss really miss track attracting

779
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:29,098
things her gift that I need the punch

780
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:31,109
punch the next I started something there

781
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:35,670
and I forgot to tell I'm it things like

782
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:37,109
that but over time you know I've gotten

783
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,779
a whole lot more discipline with how I

784
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:42,000
use my time and what I'm doing but I'm

785
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:47,099
still pretty far away from where I think

786
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:53,069
I want to be but also light will come up

787
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:56,190
and just punch me at the end of

788
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:58,849
September while I was working out on

789
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,200
twelve hours a day at the gym and I I

790
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:06,000
successfully did that for over the year

791
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:10,259
I started feeling this weird pain in my

792
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,720
abdomen and so I went to the ER they

793
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:15,930
could have appendicitis and I said now

794
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,089
your appendix is fine but there's a

795
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:21,000
there's a growth there there's something

796
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:25,200
going on with Nicole and so turns out I

797
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,680
had a tumor and so I spent over a week

798
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,279
in the hospital from surgery where they

799
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:36,058
pulled out pulled out the tumor and

800
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:38,819
that's something that when I have IV in

801
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:42,390
my arm I can't write code I can't really

802
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:46,980
do much and so it really made me aware

803
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:50,848
of you know I was only put out for

804
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,520
it was a tough recovery and I wasn't

805
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:56,040
really sure how long I was gonna be but

806
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,430
doctors told me you worked out for a

807
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,500
whole year you're in great shape you're

808
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:06,720
doing way better than than other people

809
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:10,589
and and so it it kind of clued me in

810
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,899
that being disciplined and being ready

811
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:15,839
for the things that where the clock just

812
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,970
comes up punches me at the time when one

813
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,980
life you know when I got fell off that

814
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,379
wagon - probably got discouraged I said

815
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,150
to myself you know what's the point of

816
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:28,050
doing all this stuff if I'm just going

817
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:31,980
to punch down and find myself lying on

818
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:35,369
the ground but you know all the

819
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,320
indicators and reality were know D

820
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:40,079
discipline because life's gonna pumps

821
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,650
you and it's going to be easier what it

822
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,599
does if you know if I have been doing

823
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,780
homeless things about my job and it

824
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,730
turned out that helped me a lot and so

825
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,980
when I fall off the bat wagons the

826
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,680
sooner I can get back on the better I'm

827
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:59,460
gonna be in the long run is what I kind

828
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,799
of experience so but what are the

829
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,609
practical next steps you know what I

830
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,859
need well I need to get high like I said

831
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:09,720
I need to get this task book and my

832
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:12,328
daily essential chords they need to be

833
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,270
digital I need them in life you know I

834
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:19,200
need them to be software especially

835
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:21,300
where I can I can track electronically

836
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,098
everything that's going on it'd be

837
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,530
really great yeah

838
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:29,579
I didn't have if it was integrated with

839
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:33,329
my stop one so all I had to do was punch

840
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:37,660
the punch the button and then say what

841
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:40,210
task it was hey you know hey

842
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:44,019
and I guess most people have Apple doors

843
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:45,609
and say hey Siri you know this task and

844
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:49,660
then it just automatically takes at a

845
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:53,319
time puts it in front oh so that that's

846
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:56,379
all what you do it'd be great if I can

847
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,660
add grass to the time tracker to analyze

848
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,150
my time spent across categories of

849
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,160
project where I can see a line chart it

850
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:06,000
says hey you know in your library

851
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,920
balance system used a lot of time here

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,289
and then I can see okay on what days did

853
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:17,460
I spend most time doing what across

854
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:20,500
projects across categories of over weeks

855
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:25,990
that go back weeks and weeks months and

856
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:29,980
months and would be really good is to

857
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:34,479
make the application progressive web so

858
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:38,049
that I can access it one not tied to my

859
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,539
local network home network I can I can

860
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:44,130
use it while I'm on the go and then once

861
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,130
it connects back to my local network

862
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:51,788
changes and like I said make the

863
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,230
application voice responses that can be

864
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,710
used when wanting something able to type

865
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:01,750
such as we have a high V and guitar and

866
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:04,750
they're stuck in the hospital so long

867
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:07,059
story short I'm not a millionaire but

868
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:10,509
I'm Way more organized and responsible

869
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:13,269
than they used I feel like I'm getting

870
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:14,950
order done now more consistently than I

871
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:17,828
ever have in my life

872
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:20,230
I can't conclusively back that up with

873
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:25,440
any data because I didn't have data

874
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,440
before I was wondering organized but

875
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:30,309
I feel like I'm Way more organized

876
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:38,369
getting more done because the data I

877
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:38,369
have now inquisitively says that so

878
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:44,609
that's what that's about

879
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:44,609
we're on that on my journey
