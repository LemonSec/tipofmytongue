1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:12,440
Hey so that's who I am

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,369
Mike and hackintosh reviews name of the

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,170
presentation so that's motivated to do

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,029
this talk because I've done some things

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,640
with akatosh I thought I'd share so

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,920
that's basically my reason for putting

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,439
this together I'll go through some of

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,660
the basics and then I'll do a little

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,610
show-and-tell afterwards and anytime you

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,610
have a question feel free to speak up

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,370
so why hackintosh I mean you know you

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,550
can you can download a VM somewhere and

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,800
and run it and you got to play with the

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,180
Apple OS X system you don't need to you

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
know beat around on a piece of hardware

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,980
that never was intended to run it well

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,140
okay so there are people out there that

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,819
have Apple boxes and they have to buy

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,660
new ones all the time because Apple

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,670
keeps obsoleted the hardware and because

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,259
it's in their business to do that they

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,830
generate money when they do that

23
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:10,200
so the other thing is you know it's got

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,119
an Intel chip on it it may not be

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,830
exactly the same Intel chip that runs on

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,659
an Apple PC but it's an Intel chip how

27
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,060
hard can it be so some people have

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,369
figured this out already and I'm this is

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,689
not my original work this is something

30
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,790
that's been around for at least five

31
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,449
years and you know a lot of people have

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,890
done this kind of thing and you know why

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,390
not if you have a computer you want if

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,280
you want to work with that below if

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,640
you're a fan of Apple or whether or not

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,729
you are and you just want to try it out

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,030
go ahead so my motivation was I had some

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,200
hardware and a hat some time and

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,940
doesn't want to play with it see what's

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,470
going on I like I like learning

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,050
something too and I like working with

42
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,510
operating systems I've been doing

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,160
hardware things for many years and being

44
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,840
mostly Asafa program in the last couple

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,220
of years I figured well you know let's

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,740
find out something more a little bit

47
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,369
deeper dive in what the harbor is so and

48
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,940
learn something about it

49
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,820
so hackintosh I kind of a cool name

50
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,959
what's a good akatosh do well well

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,160
what's the difference between an Apple

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,170
PC and an irregular PC the BIOS some of

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,700
the hardware and what does that really

54
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,260
mean for the operating system

55
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,640
well the operating system reaches out to

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,530
some hardware that knows about it can't

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,660
have it all encoded in itself so there's

58
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,230
a sold interface that we'll talk about

59
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,160
but basically you have PC BIOS is and

60
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,929
and their their main intention is to run

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,820
Windows because that's the operating

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,190
system that you'll find on most pcs I

63
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,560
mean you know Microsoft has contracts

64
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,530
with the with the BIOS vendors put a

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,820
little bit of this in here there you go

66
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,350
Apple doesn't have that contract they're

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,640
going to do their own thing but they

68
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,769
still have to have biases because they

69
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,238
they talk to probably the same vendors

70
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,730
that do the BIOS but they say well do it

71
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,060
a little differently and we'll do some

72
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,459
things that will so what is the

73
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,220
hackintosh do it resets the expectations

74
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,350
at Apple house what does that mean well

75
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,600
I mean the Apple operating system wants

76
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,489
to look at the hardware so what does it

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,579
say hackintosh do it makes the existing

78
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,390
hardware look like out the hardware so

79
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,519
how does it do that

80
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,738
well what does it need from the hardware

81
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,570
it needs to know how to configure the

82
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,700
hardware it needs to know how to reset

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,590
the power when they shut the lid turn up

84
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,780
throw them put into the hibernate wake

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,220
it back up again when you open it up so

86
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,180
it's pretty simple stuff really it's not

87
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,560
that hard and you know well because it's

88
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,910
Apple they want to change some of the

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,910
names and things because they don't want

90
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,560
this running on any PC so that's in fact

91
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,920
what's happened is you look at an apple

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,390
BIOS it has some of the features we'll

93
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,760
talk about and they're different

94
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,940
the PCs in some respects they will talk

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,260
a little bit more about that too so the

96
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,790
constraints that you have about this

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:03,030
activity is for resetting the

98
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,100
expectations once the ACP there there

99
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,570
are some ECPI tables I'm a little bit

100
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:14,130
out of sequence y'all get into that a

101
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:15,630
little bit later what a CPI is a CPI

102
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,680
advanced configuration and power

103
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,719
interface so that part of the app of the

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,390
system is a bunch of tables to talk

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,120
about the configuration and interfaces

106
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,030
so when you were providing services the

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,710
operating system the hackintosh does the

108
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,140
same thing but it changed the name so

109
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,080
that the applet is familiar with the

110
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,360
name of the objects that is looking at

111
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,960
and there are some things that are done

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,360
in completely in Sona PC biases and what

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,270
the akatosh does is it provides the

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,200
additional methods so that maybe fixes

115
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,180
some of the things that are that are

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,770
problematic with the with the system so

117
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,640
there are some constraints though when

118
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,990
the ACPI tables are read in and the end

119
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,090
loaded to the operating system they

120
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,090
can't be changed so what it was a

121
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,650
hackintosh do is it it sits between that

122
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,869
loading interface and it loads another

123
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,000
copy of the tables in the memory you can

124
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,360
change that copy the tables it can

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,390
change the names it can add additional

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,729
components to that to the tables to look

127
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,590
in another table for this the similar

128
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,419
function that's needed and that's where

129
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,310
they can make changes to the to the

130
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,060
methods that are done so the original

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,450
ACPI

132
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,030
the original base of the other bios a

133
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,200
cbi table stays the same except for the

134
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,299
name changes and then additional

135
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,070
functions are added as well so that

136
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,250
enhanced all the function set the

137
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,599
athletes so there are some glute loaders

138
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,330
that can do this they can rename it

139
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,700
substitute these objects and to bridge

140
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,890
the gaps between what the pc bios offers

141
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,200
and what the apple operating system

142
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,419
expects now there are some additional

143
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,159
things as well because there are some

144
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,080
harbor differences that are not in the

145
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,600
bios that have to be dealt with through

146
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,130
external drivers or to not leave the

147
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,770
Apple operating system

148
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,930
Allah has a lot for criminal extensions

149
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,919
are thirty part third-party extensions

150
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,530
that it supports

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,850
always has always will and these are the

152
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,969
places where you add an additional

153
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:20,080
proposed for Hardware that that is

154
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,330
specific to the system that you have so

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,440
a lot of the work that's done a katashi

156
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,750
is really these kernel extensions do you

157
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,180
have to do the work well I mean if you

158
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,150
if you buy or you do some pretty

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,560
standard hardware you won't a lot of

160
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,210
people have already compiled these

161
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,820
things so I need to do is find them and

162
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,190
where'd you put them in together in the

163
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:48,010
soup that you're making the soup which

164
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:50,050
is called the hackintosh so um look a

165
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,659
little bit back a little bit deeper into

166
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,240
the BIOS and the AP so Elias is the

167
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,980
basic I input/output system what the

168
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,710
bias is so it's the part of the machine

169
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,230
that initializes the hardware that makes

170
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,719
it ready for an operating system to be

171
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,860
loaded and and to take control of it in

172
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,110
and use it better so so it's a program

173
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,670
and initializes the hardware it finds

174
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,500
and loads the operating system and

175
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,440
provide services to the operating system

176
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,550
to such time as every system can serve

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,260
itself it also can provide some control

178
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,790
to the interview interrupt structures

179
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,340
well the interrupts structures are

180
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,340
needed because when there are events how

181
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,080
does the operating system find out what

182
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,659
those events

183
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,550
and then what does it do next so that's

184
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,219
the advanced programming interrupt

185
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,680
controller and there's two pieces to

186
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,539
that these days one is the local of a

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,030
pick and the other one is at i/o a pick

188
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,460
so why are these things important you

189
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,309
find out later that the processor has it

190
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,620
the local a pick and then Iowa a pick is

191
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,080
in the chip sets both those things work

192
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,389
together but so what that means is that

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,979
you have when you're gonna have a

194
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:07,800
solution for this merging between what

195
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,479
the Apple hardware what what the PC

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,270
hardware has what the Apple software

197
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,000
expects is you have to find something

198
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,068
that supports the processor and the

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,159
chipset and the system in turn running

200
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:22,129
both those things together and then that

201
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,650
gets you looking further down the road

202
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:27,629
and then back to the advanced

203
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:31,830
configuration and power interface this

204
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:34,169
is the thing that is exposing to the

205
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,728
operating system how the system is

206
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,429
configured enumerates all the devices

207
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,500
and all the power events and all the

208
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,750
voltage levels and all the stuff that's

209
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,029
specific to that hardware it's brought

210
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,120
up in these tables some of these tables

211
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,220
are usable solve them or not most of

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,550
them are based around the differentiated

213
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,100
system description saver table that has

214
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,390
most of the things that are enumerated

215
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,839
there are additional tables that we'll

216
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:05,520
talk about later the SSD T is part of

217
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,170
that so what does a CPI is then it's it

218
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,149
replaces a plug-and-play if you remember

219
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,399
what that might have been remember some

220
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:16,079
PC things and the advanced power

221
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:19,779
management so that's kind of where that

222
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:25,638
is any questions

223
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:27,319
okay so you have a CPI you have the one

224
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,420
that's on PC and there's a difference

225
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,779
between that and what's in what's in an

226
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,180
Apple so there is software called the

227
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,160
bootloader logically speaking this is a

228
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,888
piece that is really the shim that sits

229
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:47,060
between the the BIOS and and and the

230
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:48,860
boot up and the operating system so the

231
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,750
bootloader can take care of cleanings

232
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,579
some cleanup stuff there's a lot of

233
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,230
things than pcs that aren't used or

234
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:56,180
needed by Apple there's no need to keep

235
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,399
those things loaded around so I can drop

236
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,628
those out of memory and then the

237
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,029
important thing that it does is it

238
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:06,769
renames the tables the objects and the

239
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:08,870
tables that are specific to a PC to make

240
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:13,519
it look like what an apple would like to

241
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,199
see so there are other things that have

242
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,089
to happen because some of these biases

243
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:21,500
are really differentiated for Windows

244
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,420
systems are not differentiated for

245
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,930
apples so there's gaps that have to be

246
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,069
developed sometimes here they're simple

247
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:33,229
some of the device support that you have

248
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:35,060
has to get implemented in device

249
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,490
specific methods that are in the a CPI

250
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,680
some of it is dealt with in external

251
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,860
drivers so you can go over the ECPI

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,540
stuff this here hardware is very similar

253
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,069
to an apple chip but it might be a

254
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:53,180
little bit different model number or a

255
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:55,040
different some subsystem ID so if you

256
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,680
wanted to get started what do you need

257
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,240
to do well you need to know something

258
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,239
about the equipment you're working with

259
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,829
let's assume you have found an abandoned

260
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,319
computer and then why I call it

261
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,510
abandoned because if you make a mistake

262
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:10,130
with this that this process

263
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,949
if you don't want to be losing anything

264
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,730
so considered have been you know it's

265
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:19,550
like okay I this could blow up if they

266
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,370
go away I'm gonna try it anyway you know

267
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,589
if you go slowly you probably okay but

268
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,269
if you're you get in a hurry or if you

269
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,440
make a mistake you know you can fry it

270
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:34,130
it's possible to fry computer with the

271
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,839
system I did once it turned out to be a

272
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,730
system that I really like having so this

273
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,529
it was really bad for me and have an

274
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,600
eSATA port next door other course I like

275
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,180
to work with life kind of Miss that one

276
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,550
but I fried the CPU on because I play

277
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,579
with the underworld do stuff so don't do

278
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,579
that

279
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,649
so the thing is you need to know

280
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,449
specifics about the the machine that

281
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:02,000
you're going to work on because you're

282
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:04,279
going to try to fit the the a CPI tables

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,860
and the kernel extensions to that

284
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,439
equipment and more importantly try to

285
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,100
fit that to an operating system as well

286
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,889
and then you know you need to know more

287
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,899
about what that hardware is and then you

288
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,569
need to find that or support for that

289
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,399
hardware in the community so that's why

290
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:25,729
you need to know the specifics for the

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,620
processor the chipset the audio the

292
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,050
graphics and the network controllers

293
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:37,699
because you know almost have a computer

294
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:39,469
it doesn't sing to you and then the

295
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:42,829
other thing to find out is that a lot of

296
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,050
this information is precipitously

297
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,399
gathered in other words people started

298
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,469
getting into it and they're talking

299
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,930
about on the forums after a while they

300
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,790
started developing a language

301
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,469
context work with the information but

302
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,610
it's not very well structured you're

303
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,840
going to be doing a lot of research

304
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,960
you're gonna be looking at a lot of

305
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,120
forms and you know some things are

306
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,020
conflicting in the information that

307
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,930
you're going to see you gotta wonder

308
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,970
like what does this mean so you have to

309
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,189
do a lot more research a little bit

310
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,350
understanding so you really need to have

311
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,820
a lot of patience this is not you know

312
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,850
something you could do what we're not

313
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,340
you could if you had exactly the same

314
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,590
processor and exactly the same chipset

315
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,500
as somebody who had already done that

316
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,000
work and they did a superb job

317
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,550
describing step by step what you needed

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,920
to do and you had the pieces that they

319
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,170
had and you bought the same operating

320
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,130
system that they did because this isn't

321
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,880
something that you're gonna well however

322
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:43,720
you get the operating system is between

323
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,930
you and you but you know you really

324
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,000
should buy the operating system because

325
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,910
well maybe you'll feel better about it

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,900
maybe more but that policy out there so

327
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,719
the other thing is to be inquisitive

328
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,770
about during this process like word it's

329
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,690
gonna be learning gonna learning

330
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,370
something new and different maybe it

331
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,960
won't be exciting for you and if it's

332
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,990
not well you know what you don't need to

333
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,510
do it but it was fun for me and I really

334
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,400
enjoyed yourself be inquisitive but also

335
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,939
be specific in your messaging when

336
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,030
you're gonna ask questions you know a

337
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,650
lot of times you see in the forums

338
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,130
people ask the question well it doesn't

339
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,900
work well that's great you know if

340
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,430
you're if you run a support organization

341
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,699
you know that's the worst thing you

342
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,530
could hear that's that's like you know

343
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,560
it's a brain fart you need to have if

344
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,699
you want to get the response for your

345
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,979
messages you need to tell them what

346
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,230
processor version you're using what the

347
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,420
steps you took to some degree of

348
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,980
correctness and they can help you with

349
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,229
and actually they can help pretty

350
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,180
quickly when you do those things and

351
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,180
then be humble about it right you know

352
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:58,510
a lot of this is not stuff that it's

353
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,280
hard to do some of it is but you know

354
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,880
when you when you make a make you when

355
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,140
you make a win celebrate it and you know

356
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,250
just remember that you know you weren't

357
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,100
the only one to do it

358
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,440
and you weren't the first maybe were the

359
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,000
first on this particular model and

360
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,540
that's guy too but if you're humble

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,310
about it

362
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,530
people will come you and appreciate you

363
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,780
more for it the most important thing to

364
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,400
do is to take good notes because you're

365
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,260
going to be moving things around you'd

366
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,439
be trying a couple things out you may

367
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,200
try a combination of kernel extensions

368
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,380
and ACPI tables and configuration

369
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,590
there's a lot of moving parts in the in

370
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,780
the whole thing and you know you want to

371
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,430
make one small step at a time and you

372
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,900
want to develop a good experiment so

373
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,089
that goes with the good taking the good

374
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,310
notes and doing the backgrounds

375
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:49,240
understanding of what the what the

376
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:52,479
process is so what do you need to have

377
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,000
well unfortunately you need to have

378
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,860
access to an Apple computer or somebody

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,900
who has one because what you have to do

380
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,630
is you have to create an image and

381
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,140
installer image and probably put it on a

382
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,800
USB Drive so that's best done in an

383
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,650
Apple box

384
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,650
you really can't deal with the VM this

385
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,930
people recommend not using a VM for that

386
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,980
so you need to have an existing Apple

387
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,790
Computer

388
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,190
Natacha that has a blogging system model

389
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,670
that you could put the media onto a USB

390
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,830
stick so you need the USB stick and then

391
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,709
the abandoned computer with an Intel CPU

392
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,140
and then they even want to make sure

393
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,970
that that Intel CPU and that chipset are

394
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:40,030
supported on a particular version of the

395
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:43,280
Apple operating system the older boxes

396
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,650
may or may not be supported on Mojave my

397
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,720
experience has been that the really

398
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,610
really old ones won't the ones that are

399
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,130
about five or six years old probably

400
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,200
could run Wahhabi on but Mojave may not

401
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,680
be your best bet to install it's more

402
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,560
complicated it's more restrictive

403
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,959
there's just problem Bobby and Catalina

404
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,940
the latest one a lot more problems so

405
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,250
you may be better off looking at a

406
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,680
maverick server or assembly but that

407
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,920
depends so once you've determined which

408
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,079
OS fits your hardware a number of them

409
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,020
will but start with maybe an older one

410
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:22,129
and then you pick up pick your operating

411
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,020
system so where do you start when you

412
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,550
have all these things that you have you

413
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,740
have to identify the processor that

414
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,210
you've said in the controller's so how

415
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,580
do you do that well there's a couple

416
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,520
tools out there if you have if it runs

417
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,820
Windows from that box that you download

418
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,940
program called cpuid it can get you the

419
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,189
information about the processor in the

420
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,170
chipset and it might get you some

421
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,880
information about the audio boards as

422
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:51,920
well if you have Linux that you can you

423
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,320
know do a live boot on that and you're

424
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,260
going to download and run f w TS and

425
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,659
dump it and basically what that does is

426
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,390
it gathers the information that lettuce

427
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,810
would have like the DMI information of

428
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,720
DM ID code the processor information for

429
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:12,560
proxy when you info the PCI structure

430
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,510
from LS PCI and other things so it does

431
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,100
that all in one fell swoop and that's

432
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,590
every TS is a pretty cool tool

433
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,219
anyway because it'll also check your the

434
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:25,250
compatibility of your ECPI with the a

435
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,860
CPI spec not with Apple at the a CPI

436
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,230
spec so you can do things like test us a

437
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,520
little work you can do sleep state

438
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,860
testing if you want to do with it as

439
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,418
well fairly complicated I don't

440
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,100
recommend it the only reason I'm

441
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,539
mentioning here at this point is so that

442
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,149
you can gather some of the information

443
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:44,150
about this processor and chipset and the

444
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,320
system that you're gonna work with so

445
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,470
then you want to find where the

446
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,418
operating system that would fit that

447
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,159
that combination there's several that

448
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,870
fit so there's some that don't

449
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,510
so when you find the operating system

450
00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:00,110
version then you buy it you know they do

451
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,030
look for the installation guide and pour

452
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,408
through those really understand what

453
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,820
they are we read them a couple times

454
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,010
because some of the things were saying

455
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,070
are subtle some of the some of these

456
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,080
guides are written like you already have

457
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,730
done it because the person who wrote the

458
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,530
guide already did it but they didn't

459
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,820
understand that maybe you don't quite

460
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,010
understand what they're saying the

461
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,870
terminology they're using may be

462
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,879
specific to their group or to their form

463
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,129
whether the way they this they just do

464
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,740
things and it may not be something you

465
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,950
completely understand so you know look

466
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,020
at that first and then the other thing

467
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,090
is said for a particular processor

468
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,929
chipset there may be some issues with it

469
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,610
support may or may not be great for for

470
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,720
that kind of combination where you're

471
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,510
going to find most of the problems

472
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,360
really with network controllers like

473
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,400
these an F ports most of the time those

474
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,969
are pretty well supported the Wi-Fi

475
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:58,870
cards my phone cards were terrible if

476
00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:00,650
you have like an Intel chip for a Wi-Fi

477
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,658
component you're probably not going to

478
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,790
be able to use it because the Apple

479
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,940
doesn't support it and nobody's

480
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,649
the kernel driver for the century knows

481
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,690
it's unfortunate isn't sarin a lot of

482
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,980
machines but that's not gonna work out

483
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,020
while you may have to buy a network card

484
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,030
never allow my children to make it work

485
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,470
you don't want to do that right off the

486
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,240
bat want to make sure you got that thing

487
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,740
working first and then once you have a

488
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,500
working that make the investment in the

489
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,650
car so you look through all the issues

490
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,930
that are there and the issues are often

491
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:36,140
with the installation guide which over

492
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,240
time changes because over time the

493
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,690
operating system changes and all these

494
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,400
other kernel extensions and pieces that

495
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,970
people had written those get operated

496
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,820
those get improved and you know pushes

497
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,920
things out for getting it done then you

498
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,200
get the operating system that's where

499
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,920
all the easiest thing how do you get it

500
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,500
well if you have an apple system already

501
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,150
that you're about to upgrade you have a

502
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,920
great opportunity to get the operating

503
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,870
system if it's the one that you want

504
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,710
when it comes to the upgrade part and

505
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,840
your rate has started stop it and then

506
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,160
run look at the installation guides and

507
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,760
they can run this thing call I think

508
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,440
create install media to basically take

509
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,190
that installation step putting it on

510
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,240
that machine put it on a USB stick even

511
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,280
if you wants you can upgrade that

512
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,900
machine but once you do that it takes

513
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,060
away the pieces that are in place

514
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,980
there's some image files that are there

515
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,320
once you do the installation on the

516
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,940
operating on that Apple box it takes

517
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,340
away that image so you can't use it

518
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,020
again

519
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,370
the name weight this you obtain the

520
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:47,379
operating system through the legal means

521
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:47,379
set of service

522
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:08,940
what Grievous might oh okay well they

523
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,530
don't take that out from next one no

524
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,390
let's good point that's a good point I

525
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,720
guess I didn't read the agreement sorry

526
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,640
[Music]

527
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,070
the whole thing yeah I didn't read the

528
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,610
whole thing I did not I did not read the

529
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,020
whole thing

530
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,120
no I didn't okay good point

531
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:31,620
so what problems can arise with this

532
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,928
situation well when the vendor bill said

533
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,300
about PC they have a little bit of time

534
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,460
to market so what what do they do about

535
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,409
the a CPI well maybe they implement

536
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,059
enough if that windows can run I mean

537
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,190
their contract with Microsoft may say

538
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,470
you need these things in here but there

539
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,270
may be some additional things that that

540
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,840
could be in there but Microsoft takes

541
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,910
care of it

542
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,280
Apple does so you need to provide some

543
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,380
of the functionality that all right that

544
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,720
isn't there to make it work and that

545
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,870
that that may be true the most important

546
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,840
Alvin Peters HP's are better so you know

547
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:09,959
given model given given day you know

548
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:11,520
vendors do different things with API and

549
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,530
then there's through all the all the

550
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,420
reading that I've done there are a

551
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,420
several places where BIOS bugs pop up

552
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,160
and there's somewhat subtle so you know

553
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,260
you may want to the reason you want to

554
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,010
do all the research is to make sure that

555
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,169
you have enough

556
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:29,850
nation to guide you with the process you

557
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:32,340
may run into a problem with a particular

558
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:36,120
choice of computer your computer may not

559
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:39,659
be may not be worth it if the issue is

560
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,030
severe and you know best to stop before

561
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,320
you do any purchasing anything else like

562
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:49,340
business of our system so the big things

563
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,720
are when you get to a point with the

564
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,149
with your hackintosh you've got it work

565
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,820
I feel pretty good about okay let's turn

566
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,140
on the CPU power management stuff you

567
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,668
got to be really careful about that

568
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,610
because that's where you can run through

569
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:04,080
situations where the specification for

570
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:08,668
the for the given Harbor that you have

571
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,730
are probably not robust and if you start

572
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:14,460
doing things like pushing the CPU clock

573
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,160
up high you might over you might burn it

574
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,169
up people interval just down to low and

575
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,679
you put a setting in there like that you

576
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:24,450
can break the out on the motherboard so

577
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,059
those are not and that means that if you

578
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,140
replace the CPU is still bricked so you

579
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,428
gotta be careful when you play with the

580
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,429
CPU our management stuff

581
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,940
yeah yeah that's why I need to go with

582
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,190
what all the components are the

583
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,920
patrollers the North Bridge the South

584
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,020
Bridge the chipset and that you know the

585
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,090
CPU and sometimes you'll see it in

586
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,430
installation guys they'll say well this

587
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:14,740
is for you know Dell models 6230 oh well

588
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,770
it's for an i7 chip and I got an i5 chip

589
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,150
do I proceed with this mmm

590
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,160
certainly what I don't want to do the

591
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,020
cpu stuff there are some things you

592
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,890
might stay away from like they're called

593
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,690
CPU friendly that's that's what you

594
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,330
definitely don't want to be using when

595
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,790
you're when you're first exploring so

596
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:40,360
there are like you say subtle

597
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:44,260
differences between the ones that were

598
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,649
installed so install guys we have really

599
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,540
good definition which chipsets are part

600
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,430
they make form and some of them don't

601
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,320
they may have a really good processor

602
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,570
definition sometimes we'll just go with

603
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,110
you know is it a pass well or is it

604
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:03,460
abroad well general a general genre of

605
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:05,139
chips you know process your type and

606
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,050
maybe that's good enough

607
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,020
most of the later versions of the kernel

608
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,240
extensions are probably okay and in that

609
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:18,030
case then your your issues are really do

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,030
I get the CPI tables right

611
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,629
and then there's other things too when

612
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:23,580
you get to the later versions of the

613
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:25,678
operating systems Apple operating

614
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,449
systems they turn on system integrity

615
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:34,350
protection which is their way of

616
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:36,210
basically the root privilege the the

617
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,559
system that you would have to touch the

618
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,269
portion of the system you have to touch

619
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,100
to install these kernel extension

620
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:43,200
service it agreed only and the only way

621
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,600
you could turn them off is running a

622
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,789
program that has to be run during the

623
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,600
recovery mode so you have to make sure

624
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:53,309
you have a recovery mode installed and

625
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,529
that's where you get into creative media

626
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:58,470
doing it the right way to do it the

627
00:26:55,529 --> 00:27:00,749
right way to do is to use the Apple tool

628
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,279
to build media because it puts the

629
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:08,039
Installer image on a USB and it puts a

630
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,320
recovery partition on the USB as well

631
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,110
so you'd run from the recovery partition

632
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,178
to just like reset the password on your

633
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,119
box or turn off the system integrity

634
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,749
protection so that you would probably

635
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,980
would like to do that at some point or

636
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:25,649
if you're not feeling comfortable with

637
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,869
it loader loader older version start

638
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:29,989
with an older version of the operating

639
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,990
system

640
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,980
so that continuing down the path of

641
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,990
doing this you want to design controlled

642
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,760
experiments that's the boot and they

643
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,890
stop programs to the finishing your

644
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,809
computer it's not a big deal but if you

645
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,220
have a really old box you probably want

646
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,168
to use something like a nutburger

647
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,540
chameleon if you have a newer one

648
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,210
clovers your busier is your best bet

649
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,580
clovers the best support these days most

650
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,950
of the new kernel extensions the tools

651
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,360
that do the configuration changes and

652
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:05,000
they all support clover and a lot of the

653
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,070
several forms won't answer any questions

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,750
about the other ones so I want to

655
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,799
support it out there that there's older

656
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,280
versions and then you learn how to ask

657
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,379
for help

658
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,040
and who to ask there's there's times

659
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:22,400
that there's there's a forum called 20

660
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,620
man x86 and then their big thing is you

661
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,040
know beast multibeast method of

662
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,719
installing basically you install and

663
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,940
they're really anal about how they get

664
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,380
the operating system to the Box you have

665
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,480
to basically download it from your from

666
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,669
your Apple ID from the Apple Store

667
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,169
well alright there's other ways of

668
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:44,419
getting the Apple operating system and

669
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:46,160
that I choose not to use that method but

670
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:47,900
so I haven't really touched it but you

671
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,669
know beast is one way that was stalled

672
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,919
with the operating system to the box and

673
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,780
then multi pieces that is the post

674
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,419
installation part that does all the

675
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,309
kernel adjustments and all the things to

676
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,130
make it make it work great

677
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,200
so if you go over to the Sandy Mac you

678
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,230
have so many question about the universe

679
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,240
multibeast installs a no we don't talk

680
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,830
about that yet and here's why they have

681
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,690
a they have a page that we refer you to

682
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,460
and it goes a great length that tells

683
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,620
you nothing about what happened but

684
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,230
apparently the people that run 20 back

685
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,330
did some things that upset the people in

686
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,010
other other parts of the communities so

687
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,110
there's you know that's where you have

688
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,879
to learn new it could ask so to go with

689
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,659
insanely Mac you're going to be a pretty

690
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,660
generic otherwise

691
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,550
I've had good successfully or a sex life

692
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,300
so when you're making making it work

693
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,610
get the graphics in and the keyboard

694
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,860
mouse thing won't do first that's that's

695
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:48,979
your best bet you don't have to have the

696
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,129
cues and such but you get you get the

697
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,650
basics going and don't rush installing

698
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,150
and kernel extensions the those are the

699
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,550
things that are for the drivers for the

700
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,690
heart of it you don't the apple doesn't

701
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,750
know what you're done

702
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,720
Apple friendly hardware stuff like here

703
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,340
why fight you just get it working first

704
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,190
get a feel for what the configuration

705
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,040
stuff is and always do this in small

706
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:17,780
steps take good notes and backup the

707
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,240
configuration so basically install with

708
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,210
the USB stick and then boot from the USB

709
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,870
stick changing the configuration on a

710
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,730
stick

711
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,540
I'll tell you like it and then once you

712
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:31,790
do that then you can copy the portion of

713
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:35,110
the installation over to the system and

714
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,110
they just are booting from the system

715
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:43,430
and then you know after all that a

716
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,360
redress back to clover so it'll make it

717
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,630
look like an operating system and make

718
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,490
it look like a particular version of the

719
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:56,500
the system you can find that out there

720
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:01,660
are places you can go to find out what

721
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:03,430
models in Mac we're supporting the

722
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,920
particular processor or a lifetime

723
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:09,120
process that you use and you might want

724
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,410
to think or two of those different ages

725
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,629
it really doesn't make a lot of sense to

726
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,230
me I mean some of these names that they

727
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,510
have are

728
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,660
well maybe said I'm at one time over

729
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:22,230
MacBook Air pro or MacBook Air

730
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,460
right so well what's the difference

731
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,900
there isn't a whole lot except some of

732
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,480
it if you know that the operating system

733
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,820
takes advantage of of some of the

734
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,460
acceleration and the other models there

735
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,960
might be excessive to pick one of those

736
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,120
so it comes right down to it hits at the

737
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,610
USB stick there's two ways though you

738
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,449
use the old-style Master Boot Record

739
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:46,540
where you have portion of the actual

740
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,820
system BIOS interfered now it works with

741
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,350
the Master Boot Record you load up a

742
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,510
boot code it will find the sector on

743
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:56,219
them on the USB stick or already going

744
00:31:52,510 --> 00:32:01,590
to do next and run up or you can use the

745
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:04,660
efi system partition the efi partition

746
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,120
where you have portions of bootloader on

747
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,950
it for different operations that you

748
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,469
have more flexible

749
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,120
nor flexibility with the efi but you may

750
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,180
have a problem with the bias of your

751
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,689
machine that it doesn't support it so if

752
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:23,560
you have a really old machine why say

753
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,260
Dell 6320 you probably have to use the

754
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,940
MBR map

755
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,480
because the although that particular

756
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,190
system has be it fine it's really not

757
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,870
that well supported I've had a lot of

758
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,100
trouble with it and we're really not

759
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,620
doing anything with that right now is

760
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,600
they got other machines to play with but

761
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,510
so the advice is though is that kind of

762
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,879
like the way to go

763
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:48,250
so these are some references for a CPI

764
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,510
discovery if you're if you get to the

765
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,790
point where you're where you feel like

766
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,620
you're you want to do more with this

767
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,389
thing you've got a system basically

768
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,070
running and now you're going to look at

769
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:02,560
building your own dsdt changes are you

770
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,320
going to do more of that work with a

771
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,429
dynamic DST team the more that you can

772
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,710
do with the configuration ahead of when

773
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,510
the operating system loads the more

774
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,990
flexibility you have with that operating

775
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,100
system changes it will when they go for

776
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,680
version say cierra

777
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,899
- hi Sierra there's a significant change

778
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,510
in how they structure things if you go

779
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,260
to Mojave they change the file

780
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:32,590
partitions on the disk so things that

781
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:35,620
you could do with the recovery portion

782
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:39,159
of your USB stick on I Sierra you can't

783
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,320
do with hobby because its uses the AP FS

784
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,960
houses a completely different sin

785
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,250
corrected and all myself

786
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,480
very different so these are some places

787
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,900
that you could look for some general

788
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,390
information most their linings based

789
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:56,130
this is just because I was lazy and I

790
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,810
have a lot of time to make this perfect

791
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:02,580
presentation there's better places to

792
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:05,010
look but once you get into it so join

793
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,320
the forum's look around at the install

794
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,659
guides look at some things that are on

795
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,880
github and then go back to the forums

796
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,170
and start from the end of the really

797
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,430
long threats that look interesting to

798
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,800
you because that's probably where the

799
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,230
current working progress is it's very

800
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,450
young structure it's the forms you're

801
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,920
terrible in to search in my opinion I

802
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:30,139
have not found a good way to search them

803
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:33,960
and if you find a good way to tell me so

804
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:36,799
I'm gonna try to reboot the box and

805
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,800
superego

806
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,399
so what

807
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,250
see the

808
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,250
the Dell logo in the startup of the

809
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,250
v-fib

810
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,960
that's trying to find the different

811
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,460
partitions I got three

812
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,190
you don't see what I'm looking at right

813
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:25,420
now but basically it's tough a little

814
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:28,180
window things the boot the clover allows

815
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,990
you to select other part of partition

816
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:37,950
sue I have this triple boot I have

817
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:37,950
Windows - two apples running on it and

818
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,930
yeah it took a little while to do it

819
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,369
because Windows isn't that easy to play

820
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,368
with there you go

821
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,569
it says Dell on the box

822
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,480
well you know just another operating

823
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,480
system

824
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,380
thing that's really kind of cool about

825
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,960
this is I don't have to write a driver

826
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,570
for this ESP Thunder I must be seeing a

827
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,170
thunderbolt it just worked I have an

828
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,150
inland

829
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:38,570
I don't have the Dell USB see you

830
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:40,480
network - so no but that was Sierra you

831
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:53,510
know once you look at it's like okay

832
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:55,760
it's us so one thing not on this machine

833
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:59,450
but on an uninspiring I did yeah

834
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,490
actually when you mean if you have like

835
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,839
that desktop computer you're going to

836
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,118
find that a desktop is going to be

837
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:07,190
easier to work with and the reason for

838
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,619
that is the BIOS doesn't have as much

839
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,359
power management stuff on it the end of

840
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:14,359
live don't worry about you really have

841
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,910
to worry about hibernating a desktop so

842
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,450
there's a lot less crap I mean kernel

843
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:27,819
extensions that you have to deal with

844
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:30,879
so now this one I'm showing the I'm

845
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:35,049
showing the will hobby on here but it's

846
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:41,410
not coming through on the USB sorry

847
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:42,880
about that well kind of cool showing the

848
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,890
night picture now it was showing that

849
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,349
yeah the daylight picture during the day

850
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,980
and Catalina's kind of fun too when you

851
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:53,859
when you see Catalina running into a saw

852
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,010
you see the Sun different light is

853
00:37:53,859 --> 00:38:03,910
shining on the on the island of Catalina

854
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:05,470
South Vietnam Los Angeles but it's local

855
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,680
timezone it's not the times other words

856
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,049
actually it their work showing so

857
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,140
slightly yeah

858
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:23,710
are there any questions thoughts

859
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:28,240
concerns comments yeah yeah they do

860
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,559
oh well you just let them update oh yeah

861
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,509
I mean there's nothing special about it

862
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,700
um if you do this if you do the

863
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:39,579
hackintosh you where you keep most of

864
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:41,290
the changes in the ACPI tables and you

865
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,299
don't do too much with kernel extensions

866
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,359
anytime you do something with a kernel

867
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:47,710
extension it's gonna be reloaded because

868
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,098
it's going to be a new operating system

869
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,480
is to be new new part portions of it so

870
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:56,079
that's gonna change things but if you

871
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:00,940
can keep most of the changes in the a

872
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,940
CPI tables and and let clover do that it

873
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:07,589
won't be any problem at all yeah in fact

874
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,589
when you when you install

875
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:16,010
and install mojave it'll reboot a couple

876
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,990
of times and float responsibility last

877
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:21,769
boot and smarten to know that there's a

878
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:33,229
pre a preload that has to be run so that

879
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:35,049
it figures all that stuff on I really

880
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:39,230
haven't done anything with the TPM chips

881
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:40,788
you can do stuff with file crypt but you

882
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,559
have to be careful with the key as you

883
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:45,380
would in a any situation

884
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:49,010
I'm not work that area I haven't really

885
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,510
seen a lot of discussion on that but

886
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,299
there are some places that won't we can

887
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,890
find out more about that there aren't

888
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:57,980
there is some support through TPM chips

889
00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:00,589
I don't know if there's anything for t2

890
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,849
chips on non-apple Harbor I don't think

891
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:05,349
there is something that's terrible it's

892
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:05,349
an Apple only situation right

893
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,730
that's that's turned off it doesn't

894
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,730
force it

895
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,039
you have full hardware compatibility on

896
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:32,229
that laptop or this one is no because it

897
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:36,349
came with me up an older version of the

898
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:37,640
Broadcom chip and this the the brought

899
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:41,390
conscience really interested with

900
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,450
Broadcom chip there's an extensive the

901
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:49,009
DW 1828 is the one that this one has

902
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:51,710
there are like three different serial

903
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:53,839
numbers on some system numbers on it and

904
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,519
there's three different ways that it's

905
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,950
supported I have the one that's not well

906
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,439
supported so I don't mental capability

907
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:05,479
so but the USB C port works great and I

908
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:16,549
have network connectivity with I have

909
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:18,788
like a rj45 cable a USB external one of

910
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:20,029
the applications interface with the

911
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:29,329
magic touch

912
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:32,599
I haven't run that to know for sure

913
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:36,289
touch bar there's been some discussion

914
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:39,140
about that that I that I've read I don't

915
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:40,999
really know but I think it's it's at

916
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,799
least partially supported yeah

917
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,029
the way to find out is to look to see

918
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,420
you know with anybody have any trouble

919
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:46,549
with it

920
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,289
some people have have trouble working

921
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:51,200
and it depends on the hardware right

922
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:55,759
some people have made it to work for

923
00:41:51,200 --> 00:42:00,319
some of those applications this one it's

924
00:41:55,759 --> 00:42:07,309
an XPS 9350 I wouldn't use it as a first

925
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:09,319
choice just because it's you know it's

926
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,799
got a got a binky's keyboard eyes the

927
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:13,839
the form factor is nice and I kind of

928
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:17,259
like it you know

929
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,328
but I really liked mine 6230 better I

930
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:21,460
like the full size the touch and feel of

931
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:26,559
a full-size keyboard this is kind of

932
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:29,049
chickadee this personal thing right so

933
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,900
but there's there's all kinds of if you

934
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:33,969
go to insanely Mac and take a look

935
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,210
around look at the install guys on they

936
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:39,660
have a sirs that lenovo's HP's so does

937
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:43,299
homo-sex latitude is not just dell

938
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,069
latitude so they support and it's not

939
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,180
that they support them right the

940
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,989
installation guys have said you know

941
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,969
you're on your own

942
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:51,069
they said right there in big red letters

943
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:55,150
you could fry your computer don't blame

944
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:56,469
me you know it's like it's if you give

945
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,890
you that's why you have to be careful

946
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:02,170
you have to know the cpu does chipset

947
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:07,058
that you're working with

948
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:08,380
if you grab somebody's bag of clover

949
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:10,630
installation with all the kernel

950
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,150
extensions you may be getting their

951
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,680
problem - so you you want to be careful

952
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,359
what one of the kernel extensions that

953
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,109
you're that you're putting on on your

954
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:22,420
clover partition that could you know

955
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,098
like with the CPU friendly stuff is on

956
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,329
there but it's for a processor that's

957
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,329
not your processor

958
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:37,390
but I've had a lot of fun I've I've done

959
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:40,530
maybe five or six aquatic monster

960
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,529
[Applause]
