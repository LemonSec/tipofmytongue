1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:09,680
whoo I am here today to tell you 10

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:13,879
making is not cheap but it is fun

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:16,460
a lot of people ask me why I get in the

4
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:18,380
Fed making and this is legitimately the

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,040
conversation that went down between a

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,970
co-worker and I they heard I had a

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,460
length in my workshop and I told me off

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,290
I got one for my grandpa that my dad

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,380
gave me and they were like you should

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,360
get them to make depends because the guy

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,540
on the square makes a lot of money doing

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,519
it sounds like sure why not what could

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,190
go wrong

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,769
so about $14,000 later in the past two

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,339
years I've made about sixty seven

16
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:48,339
hundred dollars

17
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:59,748
what I what do I use to make pens delay

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:04,129
by using the bottom as a nova comment

19
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:08,170
too I also you don't need it but a drill

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,170
press comes in handy did you have to

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:17,330
drill the center of the pen blanks out a

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:21,110
disc sander comes in handy also for

23
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:26,120
sanding the ends of the blanks flushed

24
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:29,050
with the metal tube and miter saw a

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,860
bandsaw table saw some sort of way to

26
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:38,780
chop it down to the right here wait and

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,880
I use carbide tip shows you can make do

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,830
with smaller cheaper ones but I went

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,399
with the big ones because I also like to

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,399
turn bolts

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:02:00,850
you're gonna need a pin mackerel this

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,850
allows you to take the bushings link

33
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:17,599
put it together like this up here and

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,000
what that does is it holds it really

35
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:28,100
tight so that when it's spinning at 4000

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,920
rpms it doesn't catch on your chills the

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,569
bushings you don't have to have bushing

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,790
you can do it the old-fashioned way and

39
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,640
use calipers this is a lot easier

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,579
because it guide you on each end you

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,170
know where you need to be flush at the

42
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,870
center can be anything you want but in

43
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,179
order to match it match up with the

44
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:53,930
metallic parts it needs to be flushed

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:55,850
with the bushings and then if you decide

46
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,209
to finish with a CA glue

47
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:05,859
you'll need some CA glue we also can you

48
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:10,100
CA glue Gorilla Glue 5 minute epoxy any

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:15,680
strong adhesive them to glue the metal

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:21,019
tube into the end blank and I used to

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:26,600
use sandpaper but not so Sandlin but now

52
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:28,190
I preferred the murca mush I also I

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,890
didn't bring any with me but I used own

54
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:36,440
a paper to polish instead of micro mesh

55
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:40,130
and for the the very last piece I do is

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,750
I use hutt ultra polish and that gives

57
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,109
it the last little bit of shine that

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,109
needs

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:54,440
so I spent a few grand on equipment and

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:57,530
supplies now I I broke this up in the

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,600
phases because I've learned the assemble

62
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,640
lining assembly lining the process

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,980
allows you to make more pins in the same

64
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:11,649
amount of time phase one is to get your

65
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,769
preparation done you want to pick a bike

66
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,970
any kind of length you want and then you

67
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,640
think the tip that you're going to want

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,120
to go with it

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:30,650
and every kid has its own set of

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,930
bushings so then you find your set of

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,280
bushings if you don't keep track of them

72
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:41,630
then you waste more money buying some

73
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:43,400
more bushing once you found the correct

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:51,710
bushings and you got everything ready

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:55,719
you got trimmed blanks you actually take

76
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,719
the metal tube out of package

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,130
and normally these are longer but you

78
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:05,110
can cut it down so that it's the right

79
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:09,260
length and leave about a sixteenth two

80
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,840
or more on each end of it so that if

81
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,300
you're drilling it and the acrylic for

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,330
wood splinters at the end you have

83
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:22,030
enough where you can sand it off so that

84
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,030
it's you can still use it

85
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,390
and once you do that you take it over to

86
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,920
the drill press or you can get you can

87
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,560
drill it on your legs if you have that

88
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,470
set up and if you're really desperate

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,070
you can use a hand drill I would

90
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,920
recommend the hand drill and then once

91
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,090
you have the hole drilled you glue it

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:49,340
and buy one of these nifty little jigs

93
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,869
for your just standard I think this was

94
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,530
about twenty dollars of well worth the

95
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,080
$20 but you take just a bunch of stuff

96
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,940
that you can get at Harbor Freight and

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,789
you match the one that's the closest to

98
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,190
the diameter of your you tube you slide

99
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,850
it in there and you just saying that

100
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:15,790
gives you a nice flush surface when you

101
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:15,790
sand it with the sander these two

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,799
Mountain turn

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,950
now it's one part

104
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,939
the actually only fun part he mounted we

105
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,938
put the

106
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,539
bushings on the plank

107
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,599
and then

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,599
I've turned all my films at 4000 rpms I

109
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,659
I tried to think of a way to tell you

110
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,430
how I do it there's just it's not

111
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,800
something that I can put the words

112
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,760
there's something you need to just kind

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,340
of watch and which is why I was hoping

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,849
to do a demo but it would have been too

115
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,979
much sawdust and strings of resin up in

116
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,880
the air and probably got caught the

117
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:16,599
chandelier and once you have it turned

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,780
down to the shape you want

119
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,540
that's one of my mess ups where the it

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,770
was a coloring pencil and at the very

121
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,840
end part of the coloring pencil flew out

122
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,979
but once you have it you have it turned

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,388
down you sanded stand it some more and

124
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,630
when you think you're done sanding you

125
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,760
stand it a little bit more but there's

126
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:45,690
some more examples of mounting the pen

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,690
blanks and delay lets degree resin

128
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,130
is the finished product Dean pins that

129
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,130
we yes

130
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:07,050
this was yep this is what I did it for a

131
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,110
custom order customer asked me to make

132
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,030
them a two hundred dollar pen so I spent

133
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,750
about three days working on this this

134
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:21,270
one this one it's 300 something to

135
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,750
millimeter by two millimeter by two

136
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,260
millimeter squares all glued up together

137
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,260
in a spiral

138
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,630
what's the minimum wage I make nothing

139
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,760
so far I mean you know that into

140
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,010
woodworking cuz you like doing it yeah

141
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,470
do you have a picture of that finished

142
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,569
perfect I do it's Maya it was the

143
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,090
profile picture on my sculpture oh yeah

144
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,150
I might have enough I might have one in

145
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:55,480
here again I'm not sure I made these

146
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:58,030
slides like a month and a half ago phase

147
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,000
three four would I have to I broke it up

148
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,959
into two different phases because I do

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,540
wood differently than resin with wood

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,630
dry say on the wood to 400 grit wipe it

151
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,880
down with denatured alcohol and before

152
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:26,350
applying to see a finished I like least

153
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:30,240
and with 400 again I have cut myself

154
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,940
numerous times and of course this

155
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,220
fingertip right here is I nearly cut it

156
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,570
off completely it's it's a bloody

157
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,450
business was working but once I do is

158
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,150
see the see a finish see a is basically

159
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,900
like type of superglue and you just

160
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:53,560
apply numerous thin layers onto the pin

161
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,230
as its spinning them slowly and once I

162
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,459
have the CA finish done I use ona paper

163
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,700
in increments from 300 or 330 micron

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:09,720
down the one micron

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:15,040
it's a right side on acrylic ya survival

166
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,300
it's a special super glue I use mercury

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,209
flux which

168
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:26,359
is designed to flex a little so that it

169
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:29,270
won't completely crack and then I polish

170
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,830
with a polishing cloth and sometimes

171
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,990
depending on whether or not I still see

172
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:37,220
fine scratches I will buff with jewelers

173
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:40,160
Rouge but it really just some of whom I

174
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,650
do the polishing and it looks great some

175
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,420
of them it needs a little bit more oh I

176
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,550
haven't found the rhyme or reason I

177
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,170
don't know if it's something my process

178
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:54,050
that I'm doing differently or if I'm

179
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,530
having a bad day or yeah phase three for

180
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,439
resin

181
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:01,310
I like resin because it makes ginormous

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,260
mess and if you get up just right you

183
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:08,060
get these long rip ribbons that just

184
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:12,920
keep coming off and during phase three I

185
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:15,079
wet sand to 400 grit I may or may not

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,120
apply a CA finish it sounds honest it's

187
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,840
got wood in it really I'm doing a hybrid

188
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,850
you know I'll do a CA finish and then

189
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:31,300
the rest of it's just like doing the the

190
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:35,650
wood ace for is assembly sounds easy

191
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:41,949
and normally it is easy except for when

192
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,949
the distributor sends you

193
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:48,750
you putting together a nice fancy

194
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,650
fountain town and they send you two of

195
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,390
the same part and not one of the other

196
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,100
and you're sitting there trying to and

197
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,900
not all of them have pictures either a

198
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,730
lot of them are just words where they're

199
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:04,230
like tell you didn't put this and this

200
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,830
and this and so that's been a steep

201
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:13,830
learning learning curve also it's just

202
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:16,470
being able to decipher some it's

203
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,230
probably converted over from Chinese or

204
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,470
something but a lot of them just don't

205
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,390
make any sense

206
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:28,950
step 5 profit no problem with that is I

207
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:33,210
only have so many friends a family to

208
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,590
self instead and after going to my first

209
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,720
show I found out there's two other Penn

210
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:42,270
Turner's in my small town also and I

211
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,190
also found out that Etsy charges up the

212
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,260
absentees

213
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,690
but it's easy and funnels random people

214
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,000
to my site it doesn't take nearly the

215
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:56,730
work that it would trying to run my own

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:05,580
site and advertise so it's kind of worth

217
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:10,470
them taking 40 to 50 percent of Asics

218
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:13,460
denial keep telling yourself eventually

219
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,870
I'm gonna start making some money

220
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,180
meanwhile developing two did an

221
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,980
addiction for cool-ass tens and I start

222
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,640
swapping with other fin makers around

223
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,570
the world where I worked more over time

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,230
with my day job

225
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:33,000
so that I could pay my debt and then

226
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,180
this past summer I dropped out of the

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,160
grand on an air conditioner because when

228
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,870
it's a hundred degrees 100 plus degrees

229
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,890
outside and a metal building it's not

230
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,890
very cool

231
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,510
now that I'm in deep

232
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:55,480
why don't try to save some money start

233
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:57,370
making my own inclined pen blanks that's

234
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,370
an example of one of the blocks I've

235
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,630
returned recently it had some sexually

236
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,650
the one this one's made out of it's got

237
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,880
some glow-in-the-dark in it that's the

238
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:11,050
it's not a pressure cooker

239
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,920
it's a pressure pot it's a it's a

240
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:19,380
converted big spray-paint like

241
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:22,540
automobile automotive painter that I I

242
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,600
kind of feel bad for destroying kind of

243
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,540
because it was like $1,000 almost brand

244
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,950
new paint pot that had like the

245
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,490
automatic mixer and everything in it and

246
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:36,600
I just ripped that out and bolted it up

247
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,820
with some jb weld to seal it up and

248
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,370
built the contraption up top to show me

249
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,620
the pressure I've got the got the

250
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,050
emergency release valve on in case it

251
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,490
for some reason and I put too much

252
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,089
pressure in it so it doesn't blow up in

253
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,350
my face and it's got the I don't know

254
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,910
how well works but it's supposed to

255
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,820
filter the water out so the water

256
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:03,420
doesn't get into the the pressure pot

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,250
from air hose I'm down here we have my

258
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:10,060
casting bench

259
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:12,460
it's covered with HDPE eighth inch

260
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,040
material because you can just wipe the

261
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,360
or pop the resin right off of it it's

262
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,939
the same material that the molds are

263
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,000
made oh that make it easier it's just

264
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:29,690
remove any resin I just let it dry and

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,080
then pop it off maybe twice a year what

266
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:36,830
could go wrong I learned the hard way

267
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,410
that silicone molds are only good for so

268
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,930
many times and then the oils in them are

269
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,270
sucked out by the epoxy and it dries

270
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:49,760
them up to the point where the they

271
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:52,340
stick you go to pull out go to pull the

272
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,620
the tube out or the blank out of the

273
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:59,740
mold and it just pulls part of the mold

274
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:04,400
with it I also learned the hard way that

275
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,580
you only have so much time to work when

276
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,430
it's a hundred degrees in your shop and

277
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:21,650
the alumalite is ready to be put in the

278
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:25,370
pot at 95 the that's just I put it in

279
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,500
the pot after after work and then I

280
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:33,830
completely forgot to put pressure in the

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:37,240
pot and this is an example of what it

282
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,530
would look like without the pressure and

283
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,300
when you put it in the pressure pot it

284
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,920
doesn't remove the bubbles it doesn't

285
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,689
make the bubbles come out it actually

286
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,150
compresses them so small they're

287
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,560
microscopic and then that's why you have

288
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,380
to keep it under pressure until it's

289
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,180
fully cured if you if you drop the

290
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,500
pressure before it's cured those bubbles

291
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,500
will expand again and just cracker

292
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:04,129
resident oh I haven't learned that one

293
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,130
I've only read about it

294
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:12,679
letting in this worth it I'm one of

295
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,069
about 12 people in the world that have

296
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:20,840
figure out how to put playing cards and

297
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:22,730
inside of resin on a pen zoo as far as I

298
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,449
know I'm only one of two they do that

299
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,030
does it with collectible card games I

300
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:33,410
can make I can now make my own colors

301
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:38,300
here and make gifts I gave that one to

302
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:43,910
my mom for Mother's Day and here's that

303
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:49,720
that spiral one finish the $200 special

304
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:53,570
order on the far right there was a

305
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,510
retirement gift for my supervisor of 15

306
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,960
years I work my day job is in Telecom

307
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,760
and that was all those pens and the

308
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,860
display were made from wood that was

309
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,320
pulled from a wooden test panel that was

310
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,639
removed in 1989 but another co-worker so

311
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,290
I was able to take some of that wood did

312
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,150
they had salvaged and had sitting around

313
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,780
and I turned fins out of it and gave it

314
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:23,360
to him as a graduation or retirement

315
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:26,200
good and also five star reviews on it so

316
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,199
you're kind of addicting

317
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,520
now it's time for the live demo

318
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,340
so they wouldn't let me not Larry once I

319
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:44,660
returned so I'm gonna be making an

320
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:49,959
alumina light block I'm gonna be mid

321
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:52,060
using blood-red screen and antique gold

322
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,230
[Laughter]

323
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm gonna try to make it like a

324
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,100
Christmasy color okay if we took it

325
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,889
outside would you be able to turn we

326
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,510
could if I brought my leg with me that's

327
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,550
something you want me to do next year no

328
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,550
I can do it outside yeah

329
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,950
where she want to start with some gloves

330
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:26,170
you really don't want to get it on your

331
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,610
hands and from experience if you get it

332
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,610
on your clothes the clothes are trash

333
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,050
because the resin will harden and it

334
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,340
doesn't sound so bad and so the resin

335
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:46,240
then cracks empty washing and then your

336
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:50,129
clothes have big like cracks because it

337
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,130
breaks apart the fabric and everything

338
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:56,220
no because before I wash I let it dry so

339
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,200
this block right here takes 600 grams

340
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:10,420
alumalite is a 1 to 1 a 2 B side by

341
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,600
weight I'm going to be doing 250 grams

342
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,120
of red 250 grams of green and a hundred

343
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,959
grams of gold so I just want the gold to

344
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:24,610
be kind of like an accent color we're

345
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:30,270
going to start by pouring 125 of a 125

346
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:30,270
of a and 50

347
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,679
and these are new branded models because

348
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,120
Tuesday I want to start packing and I

349
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,980
found out that my hardener had

350
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,020
completely crystallized it been so long

351
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:00,630
since I used it because I prefer to use

352
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:07,290
royal foam resin though it's got a

353
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:10,790
longer work time so I can do more than

354
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,790
just two or three colors if I wanted to

355
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,110
but due to the limited timeframe here

356
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:23,190
I'm going with Illumina like slow

357
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,219
because it's got to work time with 12

358
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:31,290
minutes and then I can Diebold it in two

359
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:37,110
to four hours and the 12 minute timer

360
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:39,920
doesn't actually start until I mix beat

361
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,919
the b-side in

362
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,830
so the colors of those alumalite as well

363
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:59,860
the colors are I most of my coloring

364
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:12,129
that I uses from caster's choice it's a

365
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:13,719
powdered michael so it's not glitter but

366
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,280
you can use glitter if we wanted to

367
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:23,860
Commission you to make a glitter pin

368
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:25,480
that's the one just like normal blue tur

369
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,750
when I turn it it gets all over the shop

370
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,750
like

371
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,710
yes I've made a few pins out of glitter

372
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,678
although I've started when I want a

373
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,770
glittery effect i order some there's a

374
00:22:52,679 --> 00:23:00,570
gentleman out there Tim McKenzie that

375
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:05,240
makes blanks with diamond dust and it's

376
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,240
a lot spark more sparkler than clear

377
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:15,780
how's that are your carbide tools cuffs

378
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:19,740
right through because it's it's not

379
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:22,490
cutting the diamonds yes they're really

380
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,490
fine particles

381
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:41,320
is that the B side this is the color the

382
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:43,279
mica color it's a very fine dust that

383
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:53,450
specifically says don't breathe it in

384
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:57,169
because I'm assuming some dumbasses but

385
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,429
the more you use the better obviously

386
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,049
you don't want you to dump a little

387
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:23,990
thing in because this cost about five

388
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:27,970
dollars a jar caster choice makes some

389
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,970
pretty good colors

390
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,350
but I've learned from experience you

391
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:51,879
don't use enough then when you turn it

392
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:56,689
down and if you're doing a end with a

393
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:01,820
very thin edge you will be able to see

394
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,980
through to the the to the graphs to so

395
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,879
by having too much

396
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,020
mica we make it less likely to be able

397
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,020
to see through in the fence boss

398
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,820
wiping the sides yep to just try to get

399
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,460
it you mixed in universally right now

400
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,000
but when I mix the when I mix the b-side

401
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,240
in scraping the sides will be to make

402
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,650
sure it's uniform in it they were trying

403
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,650
to cut me into the sticks I swear

404
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,879
like so much work in the bottom isn't

405
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,200
perfectly fine has a little Ranger and

406
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:56,469
over and you can also introduce regions

407
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:59,730
lets you sand it after you cut it but

408
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,730
the bottom isn't the good life

409
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,850
when he first mix it in you don't want

410
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,050
to like just jab in there and start

411
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,969
going at it you want to kind of gently

412
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:20,250
mix it in otherwise you're going to have

413
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,250
a pool of mica into your face

414
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,190
all right now that the colors are mixed

415
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:37,908
up put it on the scale and reset it so

416
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,909
that it zero

417
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,539
and now we're going to start with the

418
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,539
b-side

419
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,850
is there any kind of reaction like heat

420
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,650
or anything that happened yes it's a

421
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:18,149
thermic branch and it's going to create

422
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:19,530
heat this so I'm going to test it for

423
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,660
the temperature and when he gets up to

424
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:26,210
1/2 of the colors get the 95 is 1 I'll

425
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,210
mix it in pour them all

426
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:51,000
we're part equal amounts of envy yep by

427
00:27:44,220 --> 00:28:06,929
weight my grams you mistake my heritage

428
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:08,700
either get out after but it doesn't

429
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,370
matter what it wanes right now is my

430
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,210
included home I hit zero altitude now

431
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,209
has a way to zero

432
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,850
now you mix

433
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,389
the next five minutes will probably be

434
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,389
me too

435
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:22,800
yes as it starts to set up the care gets

436
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:26,160
thicker inside 95 degrees there should

437
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,020
be enough thickness that it won't when

438
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,910
you pour it in if all the colors

439
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:37,560
won't just mesh together there'll be a

440
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:39,780
degree of separation scraping the sides

441
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,580
to make sure I get any of the part a

442
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,240
that was on the side mixed in with Part

443
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,240
B in the center

444
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,120
and before we started I sprayed the mold

445
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:02,300
with your thing mold release so that

446
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,080
when I take it out in the morning it

447
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:12,500
will hopefully buff out a little easier

448
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:17,210
if not I've got a hammer there's a guy

449
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,340
into the next room that probably has I'm

450
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,110
pretty sure anyone around the room 158

451
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:29,780
he didn't me this afternoon when I

452
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:31,870
charge my but if anyone asked it wasn't

453
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,870
me

454
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:47,539
seventy-nine

455
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,149
and the way I'm measuring it as I'm

456
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:52,009
stirring it and lifting the popsicle

457
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:54,168
stick right and measuring it at the on

458
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:55,789
the popsicle stick to get a more

459
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,980
accurate reading of the internal

460
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,960
temperature because the resident would

461
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,419
stop and start to pull off you won't get

462
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,470
an accurate reading of what the

463
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:08,179
temperature is inside so may human it

464
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,450
cool tricky once you make an you think

465
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:23,809
that it's not as far as it is and then

466
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:26,419
it'll start setting up on YouTube not

467
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:31,720
too warm but you can tell there's a

468
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:31,720
reaction on the four midget

469
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,360
for

470
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,010
yep

471
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,500
now historically the from dealing with

472
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,969
these Micah's for some reason the red

473
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,870
heats up quicker I'm sure there's a

474
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,700
scientific explanation you started first

475
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:32,559
no even it's just the last one it'll

476
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,559
warm up quicker than the other colors

477
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,620
Frank you that

478
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,970
and go over some other stuff all that's

479
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:40,350
hearing when you turn in always protect

480
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:43,530
your lungs and personal experience

481
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:48,149
protect your face a bowl that I've

482
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:52,980
turning forehead and then about 20 yards

483
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:55,640
into the yard and then I know order to

484
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,640
mask off Amazon

485
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:03,000
luckily mist my glasses otherwise I

486
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:06,210
probably would I really don't miss and

487
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,510
this is what I used to press the metal

488
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:13,159
fittings into the brass tubes just

489
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:17,139
insert supports in here except the

490
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,139
there will push them together

491
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:36,658
so if you wanted to make a bit what's

492
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:39,058
the minimum you can get a you get

493
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,849
suppressor you gotta have a leave well

494
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:46,289
you can get by without doing this with

495
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:48,020
some C clamps padding you need you can

496
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:50,460
get a cheap legs off of Harbor Freight

497
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,349
you can get cheap turning pull off

498
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:59,309
partner Frank you will need a a mandrel

499
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:00,660
or turning between center set and that

500
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:02,910
just comes down to personal preference

501
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,058
some cap some pin centers like the turn

502
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,250
between centers which instead of having

503
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:15,650
the rod that goes through we just clamp

504
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:15,650
onto the two ends turn it I've tried it

505
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:24,940
we already 95 they're three

506
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,619
[Music]

507
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,990
all right we're coming up to the poor

508
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,400
part visually we have another 1919 this

509
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,399
is where the medley happens

510
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,690
and this is where your artistic

511
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:20,980
prevalence is whatever you want to

512
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,980
however you want to front for it

513
00:36:43,240 --> 00:37:45,220
pouring it in because of the sand away

514
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:35,740
between 45 and 50 and it's good it's at

515
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:35,740
49 this is set to go off at 52 and now

516
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,850
at the corner for the next four hours

517
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:18,040
like items in there to join someone that

518
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:30,040
does like fishing net yes she knows

519
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:31,509
right yeah cast them in solutions but

520
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,160
usually if you're gonna put things in

521
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,730
it's gonna be more of like a bottle

522
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,069
stopper we have a bigger area and you're

523
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,390
not cutting out the center that way you

524
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:43,470
can do like book there's people that do

525
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:47,520
like beach scenes was it was stand those

526
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,520
tiny shells in there yeah

527
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,029
how does a guy drilled through my fish

528
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,730
hook it's hardened steel no he bends up

529
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:05,400
around the tooth oh and then cast over

530
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:08,950
it kinda like what I do with the cards

531
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,140
and then I get I also do circuit board

532
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:16,569
pens but I pay a cheap Chinese labor for

533
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:20,618
them because it's winning I can't do it

534
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:22,930
for a bracelet they specifically

535
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:24,960
threaten the circuit boards just support

536
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,890
but no offense

537
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:36,079
[Music]

538
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:39,299
and the faster you write alumina like

539
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,480
regular heart is extremely fast I'm

540
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,920
gonna have the slow but this other resin

541
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,410
could you tell us about that

542
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,380
thank you royal palm resin yeah it's

543
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:54,118
made by a guy down in Florida I just

544
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:57,540
started using it mate and it's a it's an

545
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,540
epoxy resin but instead of having mixing

546
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:04,020
at 95 degrees you have until about 125

547
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:07,680
degrees so you got a lot longer to if

548
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:10,349
you want to do multiple colors or like

549
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,089
when I'm doing I don't have to do colors

550
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:15,750
when I do these but I have a lot of

551
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:19,140
little molds that have to pour into so

552
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:25,020
the longer working time is a lot easier

553
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:30,828
I don't know what it's made out of but

554
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:30,829
it's also low VOCs no Xbox or kinky

555
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:37,010
that's good info it's a I got it because

556
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,809
I also wanna start casting in my house

557
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:41,640
like they're the winner during the

558
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:44,670
summer it's climate-controlled in-house

559
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,670
and the Royal bomb resin is a little

560
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,809
VOCs so you don't have to have two

561
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:53,430
organic compounds

562
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,290
yes either plan to upgrade it'll be

563
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:59,379
early right now

564
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,900
I'm fine with my $500 legs vs. that's

565
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,630
the one I got yeah I think there's a few

566
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,730
things but ever wanted to turn those or

567
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,310
something if you want to do like larger

568
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,900
bowls where you can get an extension to

569
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:14,590
actually probably do a baseball bat but

570
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:16,420
it's more like the wider oh yeah yeah

571
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:34,630
because of the distance between the

572
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:37,180
spindle and the bed you can only turn as

573
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,650
far as casting yeah I haven't cast

574
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:43,810
hidden they have turns just a lot of

575
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:45,040
woods from around the world they of

576
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:52,779
course the better-looking ones are the

577
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:55,660
burrows which I don't know if not larry

578
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,330
has it on him but last summer he went up

579
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:01,299
he went hiking and he had a walking

580
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:04,779
stick that broke so he gave it to me and

581
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,180
I made a pen out of it it's it's no

582
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:10,090
fancy wood it's just it was a pion stick

583
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:13,350
that he used but it's it's more of a

584
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:16,810
kind because of a sentimental value tone

585
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:25,810
that's something that concerning what

586
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:29,430
you do 115 may or may not go up on a

587
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,430
table in the atrium tomorrow

588
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:46,890
that's a that's a rollerball thank you

589
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:49,590
with a they sent me a few refills for

590
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:51,480
roller balls that you can don't have to

591
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,190
be capped for up to a year normally

592
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,050
rolled Laurel has to have the cap on it

593
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:57,050
so it doesn't dry out another's work I

594
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:11,520
do roller balls fountains regular ball

595
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:14,250
points and I've done one dipped in one

596
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,240
of the slides showed showed two blanks

597
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:19,980
on the lathe at the same time is is that

598
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,790
because you were using a pattern to make

599
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,380
them identical it's because it was a pen

600
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:32,910
had two tubes so I was just turning both

601
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,740
of them at the same time top part of the

602
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:41,129
pin in the bottom part doubled your

603
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:44,660
efficiency right there yeah it took me

604
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:47,940
three nights 3045 minutes each night

605
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:50,970
because I have to like I had to break it

606
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,000
up because what I did was I took two pen

607
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,859
blanks and I cut them lengthwise and

608
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,280
blew them up alternatingly

609
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:05,550
and then the next night I took it the

610
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,070
other way so that it looked like at the

611
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,890
end of the fake a little chessboard and

612
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:15,990
the third night I cut them all up and

613
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:19,279
created a spiral then the fourth fourth

614
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,279
night is when I could actually turn it

615
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,909
[Applause]
