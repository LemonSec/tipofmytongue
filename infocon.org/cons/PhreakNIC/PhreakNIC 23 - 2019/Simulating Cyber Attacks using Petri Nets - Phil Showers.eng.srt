1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,000
so this talk is about picnics

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,719
specifically using them to model

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,850
cyberattacks that so using cyber

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,830
modeling cyber attacks from the Capek

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,570
database

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,570
excuse me keep it detect

7
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:48,540
okay so in academic papers one of the

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,980
very first things that you have to do is

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:59,589
defend why you did the research that you

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:01:05,110
did say okay cybersecurity is a

11
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:08,229
necessary thing it's getting more and

12
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:15,789
more important research into it is very

13
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:21,280
important basically what is a picture

14
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:28,600
net so Petri nets were were formalized

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:31,000
in 1962 by Carl Petri he was originally

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,550
defined there he originally defined them

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,909
to describe chemical processes so I'm

18
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:45,780
going to use terminology here places and

19
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:49,720
transitions so what he was describing

20
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,520
was was states and transitions and when

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,079
he said the word state what he was

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,969
talking what I'm talking about was a

23
00:01:53,079 --> 00:02:00,809
particular amount of some substance but

24
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:07,270
they've been expanded to describe

25
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:12,880
various states in the broader sense so

26
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:16,030
for example one of the things that we

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,390
use to describe that we used to describe

28
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:26,739
Petri nets are if I'm describing the

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:28,890
assembly of a of a cabinet then I need a

30
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:34,720
piece of wood and I need a piece of

31
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:37,119
metal for the cabinet and so then I

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,500
perform a process or perform a

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,560
transition on

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,380
on those two things and then I get an

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,370
output for that so that's that's

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:53,799
basically what what I'm what that's

37
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:56,850
describing transitions cannot fire

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,470
unless all of the places that are

39
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,609
further upstream to them and connected

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,520
to them via input arcs are also marked

41
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,960
so you see the circles here in this

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:15,400
chart this transition cannot fire unless

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:20,110
both of the places that are pointing to

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:26,520
it also have markings so this is this is

45
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:31,510
kind of terminology so you have you have

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,720
places you have transitions you have two

47
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,899
different types of arts so you have arts

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,880
that start in a place and end in a

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,360
transition and you have arts that start

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,750
in a transition and end in a place those

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,980
are the only two types of arts that

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:04:00,700
there can be so they're they're a place

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:04:05,019
to place now you could have a transition

54
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:09,280
that had an art that fed back to the one

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,610
of the places that originally was was

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,070
marking for it so if something else

57
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:23,459
marked this like if some other

58
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:23,459
transition further up further back to p1

59
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:33,490
was was mediating whether or not p1 have

60
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,438
a head of marking so initially only p2

61
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,529
head of marking and then

62
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,379
didn't have marketing then theoretically

63
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:44,289
if this transition had a kind of

64
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,499
marketing going back win this trend when

65
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:50,409
this did get a marketing if this like

66
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:52,689
win-win this transition fires it would

67
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:55,959
feedback and so p1 would always have a

68
00:04:52,689 --> 00:05:04,149
market so that's that's a thing that you

69
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:06,789
see sometimes they also have arts that

70
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:09,309
there they basically call them inhibitor

71
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:13,149
arts so basically if a place is marked

72
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:15,849
then that transition and then it can

73
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:18,189
point back to a transition and then that

74
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,489
transition is disabled so even if it

75
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:27,539
even if the the markings are even if the

76
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:32,878
places that our sources for it could

77
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:37,300
cause it to activate the inhibitor or

78
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:41,009
will prevent it from so these are this

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:48,959
is this is a formal method of describing

80
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:48,959
processes for just describing anything

81
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:57,909
so these are different types of nets

82
00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:02,759
that you might see places can also be

83
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:05,529
marked more than once so you see this

84
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,679
example down here this this place has

85
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:12,699
two markings so what that means is this

86
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:14,619
transition is enabled a transition as I

87
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:21,119
said before a transition cannot fire

88
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:24,249
unless its source places are marked so

89
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:29,129
this this transition is enabled because

90
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:33,550
this transition right here does not have

91
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:36,929
its it's one of its places is not their

92
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,949
source places it's not marked it is not

93
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:44,409
in this state it kind of fires when this

94
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,499
transition fires it's going to put a

95
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:56,409
marking in both of the places that it

96
00:06:47,499 --> 00:07:00,369
has output so that's that's that's

97
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:04,360
another thing to keep in mind so for

98
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:09,550
example this this cross a transition

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:12,699
here when when this place gets marked if

100
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,879
if this place is also marked either one

101
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:18,729
of these I guess I should go back

102
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,699
transitions have transitions can be

103
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:24,550
stochastic so basically if there are two

104
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:30,429
transitions that that are that are

105
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:34,559
enabled then what we do is we pull a

106
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:37,869
random number and we compare it to a

107
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:42,249
rate a firing rate that each transition

108
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:48,240
has and so basically pets so then you

109
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:53,999
can introduce some some randomness into

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:57,610
what happens in the process so in this

111
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,319
example here this sequence example both

112
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,139
of these places in marked so both of

113
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,360
these transitions are enabled so either

114
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:08,249
one of them could fire and depending on

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,249
the rate of this versus the rate of this

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,580
if the rate of this transit to crossing

117
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,699
transition is set to 2 and the transit

118
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,729
to crossing for this one is set to 1

119
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:31,099
then you know at a random base of 8 this

120
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:35,659
one will will fire twice as often as

121
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:39,140
this one but you don't know it's just a

122
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:44,120
matter of running Monte Carlos and that

123
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:53,540
comes out so but you can control the

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:56,350
rates of transitions let's see this this

125
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,329
across eight verses Krusty these are

126
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:03,950
interesting and that only one of these

127
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:09,620
transitions can fire at a time and if it

128
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:13,630
and when it fires it it will it'll it'll

129
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,589
feed back into this this crossing open

130
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,589
transition place

131
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:30,529
I think this is this is some kind of

132
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:33,169
warehouse example so this is the this is

133
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:37,989
the mathematical form of a formal

134
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:41,749
specification for a standard Petri net

135
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:43,819
basically what this is saying is they're

136
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:46,519
like in order for something to be a

137
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:48,829
veteran at it has to have places it has

138
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,919
to have transitions it has to have parts

139
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,659
that have let go from local place to the

140
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:57,709
transition and the transition to the

141
00:09:53,659 --> 00:10:02,299
place it has to have an upper bound on

142
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:06,709
the tokens so basically you you can put

143
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:08,509
a limit on the number of tokens that any

144
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:13,969
particular place can have you don't have

145
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:18,249
to convene then there's always going to

146
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:22,579
be an initial marking they saying

147
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:25,970
because transitions like in order to

148
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:27,919
start a a minute in order to model the

149
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:33,259
process you have to have an initial

150
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:37,069
marking talking about how the basically

151
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:42,579
a starting point this basically says hey

152
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:45,969
don't forget the starting point and then

153
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,969
there's a

154
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:58,779
so they they also talked about the

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:04,829
possibility of there's a there's a super

156
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:09,879
space of any possible like

157
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:13,449
configurations so because you can add

158
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,910
markings to Annette third transitions so

159
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:19,149
basically a transition can theoretically

160
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,399
have one input and then many outputs so

161
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,949
theoretically you can be adding more

162
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:29,470
markings into the net just by the way

163
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:34,108
that it is operating or you can also you

164
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:40,419
know have habit shrink down to just one

165
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:44,169
marking are just one tubing and so the

166
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:52,629
the set of all possible you know

167
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:55,839
configurations of the net is this so

168
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:59,730
that's that's just kind of how Petri

169
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,730
Nets work in in general

170
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:13,040
so now now you know now that we have

171
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:23,000
this this idea of what how Petri Nets

172
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:26,540
work in 2011 there were there was a

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,030
paper that was written by a Zakrzewski

174
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,480
and I can't

175
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,509
[Music]

176
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:40,990
she she basically came up with an

177
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:40,990
extension of the of the Petri net

178
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:49,540
formalism where she added players and

179
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,579
strategies so basically she's able to

180
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,670
put like basically build Petri Nets

181
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:58,699
where there there are these these agents

182
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,750
within the net that are that have

183
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:07,219
strategies that where they they and

184
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:12,440
goals where they're wanting to achieve

185
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,240
certain markings and the way they can

186
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:19,550
achieve these markings is they have

187
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,529
control over certain transitions over

188
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,109
the over the rates of certain

189
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:27,500
transitions so you have these these it

190
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,490
can be a person or a program but it's

191
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:35,000
it's basically some-some agent within

192
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:38,329
the simulation that is changing the

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,170
rates of the weight of things that

194
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:50,329
happen in order to cause markings to

195
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:56,449
fire and thus get events to flow in in

196
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:59,420
the direction that they want so what my

197
00:13:56,449 --> 00:14:01,910
what my team did was they took this

198
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:06,560
paper and then added the concept costs

199
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:09,410
to it so basically what we what we do is

200
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,199
we say okay that is that's a good way to

201
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,319
model it now what we want to do is we

202
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:18,290
want to say it there there is some cost

203
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:23,089
associated with making this change this

204
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:28,040
rate change and there's also a cost for

205
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:30,800
if a if a transition fires so you know

206
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,029
in this and in the example of

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,469
cybersecurity there is a cost of say

208
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:41,340
adding a firewall to

209
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,990
to assistant that that would change the

210
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,240
likelihood that you're going to be

211
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:54,060
subject to certain types of attack

212
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:57,650
techniques then if if you if you do if

213
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,839
you don't add a firewall then that that

214
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,520
the the event that you might you know be

215
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,330
subject to an attack and it might be

216
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:10,140
successful might be higher and so the

217
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:14,190
transition that like if if the paid this

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:17,699
attack occurred and was successful if

219
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:21,360
that transition fires then what we do is

220
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,440
we assign a cost to you basically saying

221
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,890
hey you you didn't make the investment

222
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,120
and so now you're going to be punished

223
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:38,670
for it and so it's basically a way of

224
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:46,970
modeling you know cost-benefit you can

225
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:46,969
do trade studies using this technique

226
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,889
this is the

227
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,530
the formal specification for Petri Nets

228
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:05,050
with players strategies and costs so you

229
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:10,650
have these original functions but then

230
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,650
you also have a set of players so it can

231
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,130
it you you you basically can have an

232
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,770
attacker a defender you know an observer

233
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:26,189
you know like there's there's any number

234
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:33,370
of defenders that you can add to a net

235
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:37,440
then you we specify a set of transitions

236
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,810
that each player can control so they

237
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,090
have control over the rate of that

238
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:48,390
transition so basically this is modeling

239
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:58,900
yes I spent the extra money on the nicer

240
00:16:48,390 --> 00:17:01,390
service I'm backing up my databases to a

241
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,449
Colo site or something like that to a

242
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:09,119
cold support some like different

243
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,120
different types of mitigation strategies

244
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:19,309
that a defender might take for doing

245
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,309
extra research that an attacker might do

246
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:33,480
Oh with is so basically in order to

247
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:38,309
describe agents for and here I'm using

248
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:41,190
the machine learning definition it's

249
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:44,820
basically something that you can observe

250
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,340
the world and has skills and has actions

251
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,809
that it can perform in order to achieve

252
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,408
those goals so o is is basically how it

253
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:59,340
observes the world we don't give every

254
00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:02,520
agent perfect perfect vision into the

255
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:06,029
state of the name the net because you

256
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,779
know nobody's omniscient and in the

257
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:14,279
system so what we do is we specify

258
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:18,710
different places and when a when a place

259
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:23,309
gets marked the agent knows about it so

260
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:27,200
what we do is we say transitions can

261
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:30,830
only be controlled by one agent and that

262
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:35,210
that basically is is so the

263
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:37,550
you're being more honest a an attackers

264
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,650
not going to be able to have any control

265
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,300
over whether or not I buy a firewall but

266
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,950
I'm not like wise I'm not going to have

267
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,350
any control over whether an attacker

268
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,450
what goes through my duct from garbage I

269
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:55,189
might be able to do some other

270
00:18:50,450 --> 00:19:00,710
mitigation for that but that's that's

271
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:05,330
just kind of the there there are

272
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,990
different ways of deciding whether of

273
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:15,830
modeling whether unlike what happens in

274
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:18,800
in an attack so but player like

275
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:23,780
different players might be able to see

276
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,389
outcomes of attacks so an attacker and

277
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,510
the defender might be able to see hey

278
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,040
this attack failed the the attacker

279
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,660
might be able to see that the attack

280
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,530
succeeded and that might not be

281
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,830
observable but by the defender but if

282
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,410
the attack gets detected then the

283
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,379
defender might see that the attack was

284
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,090
detected and the depth of the attacker

285
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,610
might not see that the attack is

286
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:57,110
detected so that's that's another way of

287
00:19:51,610 --> 00:20:02,179
we also have the set of firing rates we

288
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:05,209
have the different maximum rates for

289
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:10,390
each of the controlled transitions we

290
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,390
have the

291
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,350
so this is this is where we were

292
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:27,139
actually storing the the strategies we

293
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:30,770
recorded strategies for Petri nets in

294
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,530
the in the actual rates as a as a

295
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:38,750
mathematical function and then it's up

296
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:41,930
to the simulator the person who's

297
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,360
writing the simulation to decide how

298
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:47,840
they're actually going to model the

299
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,479
player so you could have somebody who

300
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,949
decides to write a full-blown

301
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,570
reinforcement learning algorithm

302
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,320
they're going in and playing with

303
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,850
different you know levels of cube and

304
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,710
stuff like that or you could have

305
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:05,269
somebody who's just like no the way it

306
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:12,740
is is good I'm just gonna run run in a

307
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:16,750
default random firing weights and I just

308
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:23,620
want to see generally how things work

309
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:28,730
then you also have the the two costs so

310
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:32,539
cost C is how much it costs to make a

311
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,539
change to each transition that is

312
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:42,080
controlled by players and then D is the

313
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:44,470
cost of a transition firing for each of

314
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,470
the players

315
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:57,020
the way the way we the way Capek model

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,270
xanax there are there usually three

317
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,190
phases there's an explorer phase there's

318
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:04,750
an exploit phase and there's a goals

319
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:08,150
phase or basically the attacker is

320
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,150
learning information about the system if

321
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,180
they get in like if they if they get

322
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:19,370
into the system then you move into the

323
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:21,050
exploit phase you then they try and get

324
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,830
the thing that they want and then you

325
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,990
move into the the goals phase where you

326
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,330
understand like where you decide whether

327
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,230
or not they were successful and how

328
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,990
successful they were and was the attack

329
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,540
did did they get the information that

330
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:44,750
they wanted or where they stopped and

331
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:47,899
then you basically have some information

332
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,330
about how like what exactly happened and

333
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:56,360
you have opportunities in each one of

334
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:58,490
these phases for modeling whether or not

335
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,320
you know if one particular attack

336
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:08,180
technique was successful then did the

337
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:11,720
person or did the attacker try again

338
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:15,730
that sort of so these are examples of a

339
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,640
of a kbecque attack

340
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:22,650
APEC is a minor

341
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,890
minors corporation

342
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:29,820
basically puts this publishes this

343
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:36,789
information it's it's a very large

344
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:43,620
database describing the a very large

345
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:48,390
number of different attacks so this is

346
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,389
cross-site scripting we also have model

347
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,760
sequel injection attack so these are the

348
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:09,250
so these are the various phases usually

349
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:12,450
what happens is it will start you'll

350
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:15,779
start here this is the initial marking

351
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:18,549
this transition is then active and then

352
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:23,200
it's the only transition that's active

353
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:26,200
so it fires next this displaces then

354
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,919
marked this is basically saying okay I'm

355
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,080
attacking and then you basically have

356
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,770
four different techniques that you can

357
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,539
do in order to like in order to see

358
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,370
whether or not like what happened well

359
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:43,600
three techniques that you do and then

360
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:46,570
one fail technique at me so they're at

361
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,689
every stage there's a something happened

362
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,129
and I decided to stop attack

363
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,230
so that's what this so there's there's

364
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:59,539
three techniques here and then there are

365
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:01,990
various success success bit detected and

366
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,990
then fail

367
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:12,470
options here so this this transition

368
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:16,110
right here which is a is a succeeded

369
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:18,030
thing so basically if this fires then

370
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,639
this gets marked and this gets marked

371
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,100
and when this is marked this basically

372
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,520
says okay now I can proceed to the next

373
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,520
phase

374
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,950
these these slides really

375
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:59,360
so the this is this is the same attack

376
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:04,600
or this is the same net it has so it's a

377
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:10,990
little bit easier to see but it's still

378
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,990
you generally see how this is laid out

379
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:29,680
so in in the the you age group research

380
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,159
group that I'm a part of they're

381
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:39,880
actually five projects that are they're

382
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:43,690
all independent but working together one

383
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:49,710
was basically saying hey let's look at

384
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:54,280
the the programmatic or the XML data the

385
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:57,550
Capek has and let's see how easy it is

386
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:03,160
to take this information and generate

387
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:07,919
Petri Nets with it so that that they

388
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,920
basically prove that they were able to

389
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,920
produce

390
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,110
since this is actually an example of a

391
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,250
Petri net that was programmatically

392
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,250
generated from from Kate Beckett

393
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:39,530
another one is a reinforcement learning

394
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:44,990
study where they're basically taking an

395
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:50,090
attack and adding the the idea of so you

396
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:53,510
have attackers and defenders well what

397
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:59,060
you can you can model attacks with that

398
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:04,400
but oftentimes in the real world regular

399
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:10,460
users will also can also theoretically

400
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:15,980
trip systems that are designed to detect

401
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:18,260
an attack and so you it you could

402
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:23,750
theoretically achieve perfect security

403
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:26,390
by unplugging the server but then then

404
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,920
it's not very useful anymore so how do

405
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:35,590
you go about actually modeling valid use

406
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:40,610
of the system as well as detecting

407
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:43,970
spurious use of the system and so this

408
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:48,169
this is one of our researchers is

409
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:55,190
looking at setting like figuring out how

410
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:57,290
to model that that kind of how do i how

411
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:01,820
do i like what does it look like when a

412
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:03,860
regular user is using this i'm not going

413
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,580
to be able to dial all of my security up

414
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:12,830
to 11 because that would make that would

415
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:17,050
that would kick out real eases so how do

416
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,050
we how do we model that

417
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:29,669
so then another one of our researchers

418
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:33,609
is looking at taking the individual

419
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:39,639
tactics that are described in the Capek

420
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:43,090
database and basically breaking them out

421
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:46,689
and then building a constructed or a

422
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:50,559
composed attack so basically saying this

423
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:56,049
particular type of attack might be

424
00:29:50,559 --> 00:30:01,720
useful in more than one attack type and

425
00:29:56,049 --> 00:30:09,279
so how would we how would we describe

426
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:15,099
hybrid attacks within like from from the

427
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:18,729
Capek library and so that's that they're

428
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:21,729
they're looking at like the outputs of

429
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:26,320
like what are the results of certain

430
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:27,940
attacks versus if I go dumpster diving

431
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,820
I'm not necessarily going to get the

432
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:35,830
same information that I would get if I

433
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:38,619
do a spidering of a website that sort of

434
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:42,189
thing and so I can't just say okay any

435
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:44,139
attack is going that succeeds is going

436
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,289
or any attack technique that's that

437
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:49,928
succeeds is going to allow me to

438
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:52,869
transition to the next phase because

439
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:57,399
it's like for a particular attack type

440
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:59,669
it might not so so that's so we actually

441
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:04,699
have to look at

442
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:10,650
the the products of various techniques

443
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:13,910
and some of them you have to there there

444
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,650
are prerequisites there are datatypes

445
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:21,290
there's information that you need in

446
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:26,190
order to start a particular technique I

447
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:44,129
need to know where company hides its

448
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:46,500
trash so that would be more that would I

449
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:53,760
think that would probably be more what

450
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:57,540
the the first research you you

451
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,750
definitely want to you can't dump

452
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:05,899
everything in despair like everyone like

453
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,900
you you have to be able to recognize

454
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:21,990
real email traffic so and then the the

455
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:24,960
fourth the fourth research topic is

456
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:30,180
actually its verification and validation

457
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,340
so verification is did I build the thing

458
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:38,630
right and validations did I build the

459
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,629
right thing that's a systems engineering

460
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,560
Burbage to basically say did i meet the

461
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,810
requirements and did I write the right

462
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:55,389
requirements so so that's that's like

463
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:59,710
verifying that a model is right is

464
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:02,800
basically saying I'm I took the data

465
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,600
that I had and I I wrote a model that

466
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,530
was true to that data and then

467
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,830
validating is saying the data that I had

468
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,080
is actually a real distribution of the

469
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:17,679
reality that I'm trying to model so

470
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,220
that's that's kind of the difference

471
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:25,960
between those things and verifying is

472
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:31,200
easier than validating so I can I can

473
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:38,790
basically say look this this this net

474
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:45,990
matches the outputs of this Capek attack

475
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:49,480
and so there's a there's a one-to-one

476
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,640
conversion between the two so that is a

477
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,600
good verification that's a very good

478
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:58,350
verification that what I'm producing is

479
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:05,669
is true to my inputs

480
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:10,110
validating a an attack basically means

481
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:13,420
was was this was this attack pattern a

482
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:16,480
real attack pattern like so now you're

483
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:20,170
looking at okay how do you how do you

484
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,320
how do you prove that a an attack

485
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:26,130
pattern like is a thing that actually

486
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,440
happened because that gets a lot harder

487
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:31,990
companies a lot most times don't really

488
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,540
want to announce that hey they got

489
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,429
attacked and it was successfully

490
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,730
defended against because they don't want

491
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:43,919
to you know give give attackers

492
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:46,800
information about how how they did it

493
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:51,030
likewise a lot of companies don't

494
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,790
really want to talk about successful

495
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,300
attacks to researchers because now it's

496
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,439
going to make them look bad to their

497
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,439
[Music]

498
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:12,930
customers and so yeah so validation of

499
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:16,439
these these attack models is a lot

500
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:21,149
harder than verification in the past

501
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,490
what we've done is we've done two cyber

502
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:26,100
security experts and shown them an

503
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,290
attack pattern and said hey does this

504
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,660
look like reality to you and then

505
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:34,350
they'll look at it yeah that looks like

506
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:39,450
reality we actually did that too for a

507
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:42,150
couple of attacks and they threw out one

508
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,609
like they basically were like yeah I

509
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,290
don't know this is this is too and

510
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,500
there's there's too much variance

511
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:52,680
between this and actual attacks that I

512
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,420
have seen for this to be a useful model

513
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,419
of this type of attack

514
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:05,710
oh is the sort of end goal to feed this

515
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:09,220
to second IDs or something to where is

516
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,980
the math but what's what's is there some

517
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:16,060
kind of product and development earth so

518
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,280
this is this is pure research but the

519
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,880
the idea behind this is we want to be

520
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:28,620
able to prove this technique as a useful

521
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:35,160
technique for feeding trade studies and

522
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:38,380
showing showing different kind of

523
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:44,700
reactions like different different

524
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:49,960
defense patterns are more or less useful

525
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:53,669
you know in particular attack types so

526
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:57,040
by labeling attacks a certain standard

527
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:02,930
defending the responses

528
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:08,060
yeah so one of one of the things that we

529
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:11,960
did and so the last one is one of the

530
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,660
ones that I've been looking at that I've

531
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,190
been doing is basically using

532
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,480
reinforcement learning to I've touched

533
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:24,350
mentioned it a couple of times because

534
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:31,550
that's kind of what I do I I'm thinking

535
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:35,170
up another doctor just another doctor

536
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:37,670
and doctoral students research he

537
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:42,350
defended a dissertation based on this

538
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:47,530
and I'm extending his research to like

539
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:53,920
in the reinforcement learning realm and

540
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:56,780
basically applying his technique to the

541
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,860
the technique that so so basically what

542
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:03,400
he did was he he took Capek attacks and

543
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:07,130
then hand-built

544
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,109
these these nets so what I'm doing is

545
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:15,349
I'm taking the the generated

546
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:20,990
auto-generated knits and I'm applying

547
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:23,920
that to it and proving that this this

548
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:31,098
also is a thing that that you can be

549
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:36,140
it's the the difference there is the the

550
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:41,089
the attacks have have changed between

551
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:46,129
the like enough between when what he was

552
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:50,230
doing his research and when I'm doing my

553
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:53,569
research that there's the comparing the

554
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:57,980
outputs are going to be a challenge to

555
00:38:53,569 --> 00:39:02,770
so for me the verification was going to

556
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,770
be an interesting problem to say

557
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:14,619
maybe modeling the beaching net so we

558
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,670
have your model say C is container

559
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:21,380
more serious in town

560
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:23,359
Turkson see this you ask us some AWS

561
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,930
containers

562
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,598
Bharati salsa and some of these are hard

563
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,720
and more than others do some things like

564
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,849
take an attack model it men throw it at

565
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,950
what and see what comes out of it does

566
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:40,769
it match and that to insist you wouldn't

567
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:44,220
get validating does your model match

568
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:47,069
what that system can do or does it not

569
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,390
is there some way that you can bring the

570
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:50,390
application sitting on that system

571
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:02,240
you know where the edges might be for

572
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:04,319
that so this is so-so Petri Nets are

573
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,109
they're not really a construct on a

574
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:13,480
control structure they're they're more

575
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:15,770
of a way of describing a process so

576
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,450
[Music]

577
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:22,320
basically there's there's no there's no

578
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:27,060
way to other than by changing the the

579
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:31,950
transition rates like between transit

580
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:35,730
and like for the transitions to to say

581
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:42,060
okay I I have I have gotten this

582
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:47,580
particular type of marking so now I am

583
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:49,440
going to do this particular activity and

584
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:53,910
I'm going to get this perfume like this

585
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:58,440
result they're they're more they're more

586
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:05,730
I'd like there there still is a level of

587
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:10,050
randomness involved so what you could do

588
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:12,840
is you could train agents on a petri net

589
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,240
and then take the take take the

590
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:19,290
strategies that are developed from that

591
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:23,740
and then map that into some some some

592
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:26,080
other simulation

593
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:34,169
and then you could then play war games

594
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:34,170
with those strategies but as far as

595
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:46,410
using using a a Petri net as as some

596
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:52,660
kind of control structure RNA in some

597
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:56,549
ecosystem that's some of these so a lot

598
00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:01,680
of times when we when we look at these

599
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:06,520
these graphs they look like other graphs

600
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:12,040
like like computers talking to each

601
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:14,530
other or layers that's that's not what's

602
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,190
going on here these are these are these

603
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:24,990
are states that that are basically

604
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:30,270
moving back and forth like so it's it's

605
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:30,270
it's kind of it's a lot more abstract

606
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:40,220
I'm sending sending information from

607
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:40,220
from one to another

608
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:53,180
any questions when validating try

609
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,180
something

610
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:04,580
so you you've what what what we do and

611
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:08,810
actually the the one of the tools that

612
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:13,009
we use for simulating Petri Nets is a

613
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:18,220
tool called pipe and that's what I have

614
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:22,640
up here right now and one of one of the

615
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:26,089
one of the analysis tools that pipe

616
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,629
provides is a way of saying it is a way

617
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:33,250
of taking a Petri net and then running

618
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:36,850
it you know a million times and and

619
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:39,890
showing yes these are the various

620
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:42,460
configurations and this is the the

621
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:46,400
likelihood that you're going to see a

622
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:50,810
particular kind of you know

623
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,820
configuration of the net and and so then

624
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:56,000
you can you could what it'll do is it'll

625
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:59,230
actually give you some it'll give you

626
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,230
information about

627
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:34,589
yeah okay so basically what this what

628
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:39,030
this does what this is is it's a this

629
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:45,720
shows all of the all of the transitions

630
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:52,589
and the likelihood the a that they are

631
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:59,160
that they're going to fire and basically

632
00:44:52,589 --> 00:45:01,109
it's showing the the arcs its mapping

633
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:06,930
that back to how the arcs are connecting

634
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:10,109
around so that's this I so it's pretty

635
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:14,250
fast it's a there's there's various

636
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:19,230
analysis tools for looking at a picture

637
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:24,210
in that and like looking at the the

638
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:25,859
global space the marking space now when

639
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:32,940
you start looking at these these

640
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:38,369
gigantic jpeg nodes it so so pipe pipe

641
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,440
has been defeated by some of these very

642
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:46,680
large Nets what we wind up doing with

643
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:50,369
these things what we wind up doing with

644
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:54,089
these guys is we we break them up into

645
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:57,119
their into their various spaces and we

646
00:45:54,089 --> 00:46:00,920
we run the analysis over over the phases

647
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,920
and that gives us

648
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:07,930
yeah these are very good like anytime

649
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:11,470
you see a transition feet backwards well

650
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:22,589
now you've you know multiplied the

651
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:22,589
complexity by a lot any other questions

652
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,999
he said peace

653
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:38,289
so whatever one of our grad students he

654
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:45,299
supposedly defended his dissertation was

655
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:48,549
built a tool that took the XML and

656
00:46:45,299 --> 00:47:08,469
generated kbecque generated Petri Nets

657
00:46:48,549 --> 00:47:13,049
from the Capek attack description he had

658
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:19,019
to do quite a lot of mapping to like

659
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:25,109
keeping track of tag information

660
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:29,459
