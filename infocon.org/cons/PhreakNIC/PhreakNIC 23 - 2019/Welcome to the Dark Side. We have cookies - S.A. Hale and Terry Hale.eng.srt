1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:09,349
we're going to talk about the dark side

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:12,169
of psychology and we do that because we

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:16,580
do social engineering that's what we do

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:19,460
and we do it even when we mean not to do

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,330
it's just kind of us and I didn't mean

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,099
us

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,479
we'll introduce ourselves I would go

8
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:39,730
along so the whole idea is that we have

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:43,220
cookies bring all that yes so we wait

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,540
we're a small little research group to

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,970
people and so we do work in the area of

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,089
social engineering cyber warfare and

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,300
I've always come from cyber warfare from

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,270
of people's perspective a good example

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,910
why hacked into the computer when I can

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,150
hack into the people the other thing we

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,520
would do is instead of trying to distill

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,219
the information off the computer in a

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,890
group in a computer control room just

20
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:21,609
change the frequency of the refresh rate

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:23,880
makes people sick that's how I think

22
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:26,610
okay

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,689
and they wonder what not so anyway we

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,600
can into a lot of things called

25
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,860
cognitive biases behavioral economics

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,530
all these are in the world of psychology

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,680
neuroscience neurobiology so we look at

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:46,549
those things are in your brain in my

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:51,030
brain that we can take advantage of ok

30
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:54,869
so who are now I am si I am retired so

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,810
keep off of my line could care less

32
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,569
about the lawn we have trees it's all I

33
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,840
care about this truth anyway but I've

34
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,539
been about 35 years and dealed me work

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:12,150
most of it top secret level did stuff

36
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:16,310
for Navy SEALs Marines x-band radar so

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,610
missile defense how long fun some days

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,069
anyway

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,870
the I'm also an adjunct confessed

40
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,518
professor of computer science at Essen

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,880
State University been doing that for 20

42
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,040
years and before that I was chairman on

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,820

private junior college it's kind of

45
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,590
strange to find one of those so anyway

46
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,390
so now we have fun we don't have to do

47
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,000
things to people while we do things

48
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:55,260

61
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:34,140
you about how to make glass beats Act

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,140
with this yeah so okay okay

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,420
cookies

64
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:49,520
and to look at the slides yeah okay you

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,590
all know about computer cookies right

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,830
you know you go to a website they want

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,820
to you know download cookies to you most

68
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,850
of us go okay you know because cookies

69
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,130
are opposed to be just a key that

70
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:08,150
unlocks any information that you allow

71
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:11,240
that website to have now we can get yeah

72
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,840
we can get fun we can have fun with with

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:19,190
cookies but if you're looking at them

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:23,600
they're posted just be a key we do the

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:27,680
same thing in psychology in that we have

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,620
cookies also and we download those

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,520
little cookies to your brain by way of

78
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:38,300
talking by way of interaction by way of

79
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,840
socializing with you we know the cookies

80
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:45,200
to download to you so that the next time

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,429
we see you is hi how you doing great to

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:54,710
see you again fires up all their memory

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,400
so he's working they that was we know

84
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,750
them now we can start anymore

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,690
they out of that first so because

86
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:15,610
the whole thing here is that we're here

87
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:19,630
to give information from you okay so

88
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:25,860
it's social engineering what we do is we

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:30,460
look at covert emotional manipulations

90
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:34,150
yeah we're not here to be free right

91
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,000
here dark

92
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,659
persuasion we'll talk about different

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,820
types of persuasions yes we're into

94
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,849
mind-control we're into human mind games

95
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,659
we like deception and we like

96
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:55,419
brainwashing all that is what a social

97
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,840
engineer does those things we call

98
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:01,539
people hackers now the movie shows that

99
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,130
we do it in five minutes and then in

100
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:06,460
about three minutes later they are on

101
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:10,449
the computer okay it don't work that way

102
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:16,169
to really do it right may take months or

103
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:19,360
years it's a social be engineer someone

104
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,870
still faster and cheaper than trying to

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,870
hack a computer

106
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,748
so let's look at some examples for the

107
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:33,499
world of business psychology in

108
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:37,459
particular sales now Terry kind of

109
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:41,719
glossed over her background of sales at

110
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:46,550
age 12 you started selling in your mom's

111
00:06:41,719 --> 00:07:02,300
a shoe store but she didn't just show up

112
00:06:46,550 --> 00:07:04,279
she studied how to do yeah let me give

113
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,189
you an example how many I bought a car

114
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:14,449
lately we bought one just few months ago

115
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:18,499
great wonderful salesman so helpful then

116
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:22,399
they move us over to the man what is his

117
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:26,599
job to sell us thousands and thousands

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:31,189
and thousands of dollars of Anton okay

119
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:36,050
now what Terry ball was another Mini

120
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:47,749
Cooper 6-speed manual easily 150 miles

121
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:49,699
per hour anyway he was telling us that

122
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:54,679
because it's a manual we're going to go

123
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:59,419
through four Reed clutches and we're

124
00:07:54,679 --> 00:08:00,739
both looking at and go do we grew up

125
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:05,719
with manuals

126
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:12,070
I remember at 12 I was driving manual my

127
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:14,980
granddaddy's truck and : well yeah

128
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:18,940
yeah Terry's about the same way driving

129
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:22,060
a manual is just something you do now

130
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,310
another example of this was a young lady

131
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,950
came into the dealership not the war we

132
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,920
bought but this is example and she

133
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:34,179
needed to lease a vehicle and she was

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,550
single had a child credit history not

135
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,439
that grade and we can all blame her for

136
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:43,659
making stupid decisions you know but the

137
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,060
salesman you know said look I can't get

138
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,530
you the 289 a month when I can get you a

139
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:55,209
309 and she's like I need car so okay

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:09:03,250
then his financial person came up and

141
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:05,770
when did we get her to up to 89 but what

142
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,680
you've got to do is sell for this list

143
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:15,490
of patterns that will add up to

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:17,859
something like from 315 a month the

145
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,960
salesman is writing this article when he

146
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,470
went in did the worst job the evidence

147
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,970
lies and says trying not to get her the

148
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,970
by use stuff

149
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,750
and so but she bought increasing the one

150
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:42,460
of them every one of them

151
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:46,690
so her payments were 350 now why did

152
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:52,660
that happen it happened because the

153
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:58,570
customer liked the cells the customer

154
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:01,959
trusted the cells the customer believed

155
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:11,230
that the salesman had her best in

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:15,070
teaching at heart she was wrong but why

157
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,520
does that happen hear about it all the

158
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,650
time give you another real-life example

159
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:30,850
that happened back in undergraduate

160
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:35,880
school the young co-ed cute just real

161
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,880
cute she asked the guy to come over

162
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,329
she making dinner in the dorm room now

163
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,810
this distance back of the dais we have a

164
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,859
hot plate ill lately in your dorm room

165
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,839
because you're supposed to eat at the

166
00:10:47,860 --> 00:11:02,220
cafeteria so every barrelled news way to

167
00:10:52,839 --> 00:11:06,940
a guy's heart was you know the guy came

168
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,509
ate the dinner left for a date with

169
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,509
another girl

170
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,420
now she was heartbroken

171
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,810
yeah cuz she thought she had the evening

172
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:25,180
with this this guy we had other words

173
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:29,920
about what he was but yeah but what she

174
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:33,209
liked him she trusted him she believed

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,599
that he had her best interests at heart

176
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,599
she was wrong

177
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,459
these are some of the tools that come

178
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,009
right out of business psychology we'll

179
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,689
talk about more we don't want 13 that

180
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:58,660
we're going to cover that you're gonna

181
00:11:46,690 --> 00:12:00,360
learn tonight now okay now why does this

182
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,519
stuff work

183
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:10,060
is it magic no it's not sorry to tell

184
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,029
you that okay that it's not math it's

185
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:21,790
basic because we are humans we are Homo

186
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:26,160
sapiens we are after in the world of

187
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:29,709
cognitive biases we have in our brains

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:34,480
stuff that's been embedded in there for

189
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:38,250
hundreds of thousands of years we're

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:44,589
still using that kind of a brain an old

191
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:48,790
brain to do live in a modern world in 95

192
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:53,800
percent of human history we have lived

193
00:12:48,790 --> 00:13:00,279
in tribal units this is about the size

194
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,709
of a tribe what's the oldest known city

195
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,319
in the world

196
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:07,439
maskull's

197
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:15,269
but close its into the Macedon area but

198
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:22,679
its particular town oh yeah okay but

199
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:27,389
like exactly right it's only six

200
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:29,309
thousand years old so the rest of

201
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,399
hundreds of thousands and thousands

202
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:39,929
thousands and thousands of the years we

203
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:46,259
have lived in groups about this size we

204
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:50,459
still think in tribal ways we think

205
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:57,329
about the day to day he Alabama fans

206
00:13:50,459 --> 00:14:13,348
here we're all college-educated that's

207
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:15,628
right look look at school's football you

208
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:19,379
know that's there's your tribe right

209
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:22,079
there here's another tribe we're all

210
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:25,259
kind of geeks okay mean well so we've

211
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,429
been a technical conference okay that

212
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:32,099
separates you from the jocks and yeah

213
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:35,189
and now a lot of times you can belong to

214
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:40,889
multiple groups multiple tries but by

215
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:46,468
understanding this area of us versus

216
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:48,780
them we can't begin to part the ways and

217
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:53,730
know who we can talk to

218
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:58,920
whoo-hoo Rican guy gasps lightly who we

219
00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:02,670
can to see brain wash control is knowing

220
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,439
things about your tribe how do you know

221
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,939
that how do you get to know that yes

222
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,510
questions that's a lot harder than you

223
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,060
think

224
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:16,770
just talking to people so we know wait

225
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:22,760
what we look at is it's your mind but

226
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:27,810
our and that's what you want to get to

227
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,550
okay see that slide just have three

228
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:36,319
bullets on it but here's the backup

229
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,319
slide yet because forever okay

230
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:46,480
there's been numerous books now written

231
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:50,620
articles about the whole world of dark

232
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:55,690
psychology and it basically is looking

233
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:58,779
at how to read and understand the nature

234
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,899
of people wanting to prey upon other

235
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,910
people yes we even talked about some

236
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,970
pretty bad people that would you're

237
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,769
Psychopaths or socialize those kind of

238
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,709
people normally in a normal day the day

239
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,449
interaction when you talk with somebody

240
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:23,369
you're trying to help those people make

241
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:26,769
a decision that is positive for them but

242
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,500
when the social engineers present I'm

243
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:35,829
trying to help you make a decision that

244
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:39,699
is good for me it takes a while to do

245
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:43,769
that now tonight what we're going to

246
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:49,709
look at is a Terry and I have researched

247
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:55,260
over a hundred psychological tricks now

248
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:58,209
research is a fun way for us to say

249
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:10,310
experimenting on unsuspecting

250
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:10,790
and then we made notes about that's

251
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,849
right

252
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:17,079
you know so I've seen Terry take the

253
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:20,719
poor car salesman apart we were dating

254
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,339
six used to be 30th anniversary for us

255
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,100
so we were dating

256
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:35,300
and she spot one look at a car and she

257
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:41,870
said watch this it was like holy crap it

258
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:46,490
was afraid not to that she took this guy

259
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:50,270
apart never said an unkind word never

260
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,900
raised two boys just didn't do what the

261
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:59,420
book said you're supposed to do as the

262
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:01,540
customer I swear I thought that guy was

263
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,730
going to give her the keys to that car

264
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:13,190
just here take it leave go away

265
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:18,770
we would have to sew as we we look at

266
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:21,620
these techniques we're interested in how

267
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:26,389
do you use these we do you see these

268
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:28,570
type of techniques commercials internet

269
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,570
ass

270
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:38,770
sales techniques of course how managers

271
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:45,080
talk to people how leaders talk to us

272
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:46,550
you know election season both sides yes

273
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,610
exactly

274
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,580
both sides Oh coworkers

275
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:56,469
you can even see how these techniques

276
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,120
are used by people you love and trust

277
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,900
we've seen all kinds with kids

278
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:07,389
one of the classic kids example is mom

279
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:11,270
says no so what do they do go go see did

280
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,910
you know of course dad goes what mom

281
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:18,980
said well she said it was okay if it's

282
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:28,400
okay with you Terry is that what he said

283
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:32,590
no so we put the whole premise of social

284
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:39,430
engineering is we are here to help you

285
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:42,970
help us okay I mean one of the classics

286
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:45,640
movies they were show every year in

287
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,810
computer security was you know

288
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,510
situational awareness which we will talk

289
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,750
about but they would have this guy in

290
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:58,220
the bar and a blonde always had to be

291
00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:02,630
blonde bombshell would come up I mean

292
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:06,080
you know just gorgeous and start talking

293
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,280
to the engineer the geek with glasses

294
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,280
you know

295
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,119
out loud which I probably should sit

296
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,299
down first thing I do call Terry because

297
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,309
she needs a good laugh I said the next

298
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,580
thing I do is it's called a company

299
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:29,039
security manager because well he needs a

300
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,689
good laugh too because this is a man one

301
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,559
day we were doing some social

302
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,559
engineering work and I asked a student

303
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:43,710
in mind if she would be the lead for

304
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:48,960
this she was attractive mother of three

305
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:54,019
type expert marksman black belt in

306
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,019
karate but just

307
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,899
she shows up dressed nicely I'm not

308
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:05,629
showing anything made her own badge

309
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:08,750
saying who she worked for as a news

310
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,850
person sit down I said she said which

311
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,490
group do I need to go talk to

312
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:18,918
I went that girl she did then we did it

313
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:24,649
out briefing the next day she told them

314
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:31,309
everything they told her when she walked

315
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:36,039
up on stage you song go she was just

316
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:41,500
nice to asked intelligent questions

317
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:43,460
never pushed get all the info she wanted

318
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,380
okay

319
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:54,800
so we're going to talk about 13 tricks

320
00:21:47,380 --> 00:22:02,920
today and what we want to look at these

321
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:06,020
tricks are oh yeah it's working oh so is

322
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,190
when you start talking with somebody and

323
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,980
of course we're going to use the word

324
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,700
target but then this works in whether

325
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,820
you're at work charter at your school

326
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,940
you pick a word okay that you've heard

327
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:30,590
them use a couple of times and you use

328
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:32,510
that word that's cool cool you start

329
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,310
using that water to repeat the words

330
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,879
that they say you start using it you can

331
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:42,050
respond them to watch if they start

332
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:46,820
using that word more frequently you're

333
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:50,750
tuned in to one another just getting

334
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,610
tuned into each other so then are you

335
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:57,100
beginning to gain trust

336
00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:00,709
now when you're doing this not and

337
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,600
maintain eye contact okay we'll talk

338
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,480
more about iContact in just a few

339
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:11,000
minutes but you understand I contact

340
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,510
not that subject nodding is not that

341
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,830
another fun trick to try is trying to

342
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:20,929
say yes a positive statement or

343
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:27,080
statement that should be a yes statement

344
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:35,929
and do this at the same time you can do

345
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:37,370
this and do it yes yes they'll say yes

346
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,419
but they'll be doing this via their

347
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:43,280
behavior is in yes and that's one of the

348
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,660
FBI behavioral things that's because

349
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,620
their brain knows it's a negative

350
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,770
statement in it it won't do this yeah so

351
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,129
try the opposite it's really really hard

352
00:23:51,770 --> 00:24:01,150
to do it's fun to do because it's you

353
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,150
know it's giggles you know to do that so

354
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:16,950
psychological studies have been done and

355
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,950
a person's name is music to their ears

356
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:25,769
Spacely if you say it in a nice way in a

357
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:30,159
pleasant respectful tone

358
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:36,639
people respond to that one of the things

359
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:41,889
Tara does is when a waitstaff comes up

360
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:48,639
she would use them thank you you know

361
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:51,939
you soon perk up my job so but this

362
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:55,719
works very very well it also reinforces

363
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,870
the idea that you are into you that you

364
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:03,039
have recognized and stated they are

365
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:07,268
personal they are human beings they have

366
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,580
worked all big deals especially with

367
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:12,990
equal service in the nursery who

368
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,990
normally doesn't hear that

369
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,418
one of the coolest tricks that has been

370
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:30,289
used a lot in do remember the old TV

371
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:36,159
show called maverick if in reruns now

372
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:36,158
slack and ye no no comment no chips and

373
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:46,399
playing rockers

374
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:48,829
yeah James going Turner yeah he would be

375
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:52,158
sent around talking and you know it was

376
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:55,369
BS that he was spread but he was doing

377
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,429
set people up he would you some wine

378
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:02,958
my grandpappy always said or my

379
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:04,729
granddaddy talked me people believe it

380
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:08,889
so if you want people to believe

381
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:13,039
something my daddy always told me good

382
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:17,119
advice and the south you really want to

383
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:20,119
get people my mom told me I got to do it

384
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:23,708
this way people believe it they believe

385
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,708
whatever you tell them that's okay

386
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:32,059
why do you learn these tricks because

387
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,939
these are the tricks that are used on us

388
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,769
every day or if you're doing social

389
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,069
engineering you want to use on somebody

390
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,069
else

391
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,909
you're in a crap group of people we had

392
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,830
a bar

393
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:53,350
you're trying to find your target you

394
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:58,020
think people maybe are watching you

395
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:01,270
maybe they know what you're doing young

396
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,629
and then quickly look at the person you

397
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,280
think is watching you if they are

398
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:16,540
intensely watching you they will be on

399
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:21,420
to unless they're a psychopath now and

400
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:24,639
if they are a psychopath run yeah but

401
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,080
the other one that you can always do if

402
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
you think somebody's watching you

403
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,699
intensely is look at your watch of

404
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,790

405
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,680
watching happens yeah

they have cokes yeah

437
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:26,939
I wouldn't that think about how it

438
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,580
different when I go and visit relatives

439
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,570
in Ohio in Michigan and that eager they

440
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,570
do not call them cokes

441
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,030
other parts of the country Levin is so

442
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,020
done

443
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:47,470
the best way that the Germans found

444
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,570
somebody who had escaped in America who

445
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,750
had escaped from prison war camp was

446
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,750
hell

447
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,630
they'd even had to talk to them they

448
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:11,000
could see them across a restaurant how

449
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:18,440
do Americans use a fork which hand right

450
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:22,640
hand Europeans left so we will switch

451
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,410
cut the meat switch back to eat bingo

452
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,680
you're an American you're under arrest

453
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,080
it was that simple and that was so

454
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,790
simple that they could teach the German

455
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:38,780
citizens to look for it also so you've

456
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:42,200
got to know about those high geosync

457
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,090
receipts we have to know about from

458
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,010
different parts of different people from

459
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:49,699
different countries and then the punt

460
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,280
school that have lots of foreigners and

461
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,290
sit in a restaurant he'll hear multiple

462
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,100
languages being spoken

463
00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:04,460
I mean when another thing we can try is

464
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:10,789
called the touch and let's try there

465
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:11,899

chimpanzees and apes they love it too

495
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,960
you know and we see it all the time so

496
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:48,180
tells them something you know there's a

497
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,790
really good movie to watch called

498
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:57,540
primary colors and it's a take-off on

499
00:33:52,790 --> 00:34:03,629
the Clinton campaign and they talk about

500
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:06,870
this handshake and this is from 90s yeah

501
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:10,169
a long time ago but they talk about this

502
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:13,888
how he you know watch how it shakes a

503
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:16,290
person's you know if we go right through

504
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:19,409
it this it's all beautiful the way you

505
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:24,080
do it sells news do the same thing you

506
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,080
will learn that technique also for me

507
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:37,929
now the people see them yeah you're but

508
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:42,420
she's awfully shampoo you need to go so

509
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,420
this is the way you do it now

510
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,560
you know it would be something like that

511
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:57,680
no thanks but holdover from it he said

512
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,529
the 100 years before with man with

513
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:07,120
greatest and you know kisses like that

514
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:07,120
but you never but woman's you know

515
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,970
[Music]

516
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:20,410
that's so different than what even when

517
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:23,319
I was growing up high school 72 when I

518
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,890
graduated you would just begin with

519
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,630
States and females exhibit the behavior

520
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,640
of equal okay

521
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:36,610
still slightly more delicate handshake

522
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,850
yeah slightly but a lot of that has to

523
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:42,520
do with the feet no you may weigh a

524
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,770
hundred or sometimes less than you and

525
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,300
so it's not okay you know because

526
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,000
they're not being taught people to grab

527
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,660
their hands like a vise make them fall

528
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,390
to their knees

529
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,390
you know remember those talks

530
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,069
[Laughter]

531
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,919
people other cultures is variants and

532
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,960
health health close together you stand

533
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,890
what are you talking to

534
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:31,580
yes that's in that what is called

535
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:36,259
personal space okay I'll give you a good

536
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:40,069
example I want total of marina carnal

537
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,210
thank you think he was wrong and he went

538
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,780
well

539
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,730
no I'm not I go yes you are let's get in

540
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,599
the car we'll go right now and I'll

541
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,960
prove it to you

542
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,359
well I don't have time couple hours

543
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,880
later I saw him disappear come back in

544
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:04,460
fearing this before he left he was

545
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:07,070
standing he was 6 4 got to gut with me I

546
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,580
mean about that much space in between us

547
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:13,910
ok and when he says no that's not

548
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:19,520
happening that way I went good - good

549
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:21,319
yes it is let's go see it right now he

550
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,720
came back about two three hours later

551
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:29,570
and when thank you I was right I know

552
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,118
what's right but you know most people

553
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:35,089
would back down and go who personal

554
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,190
space and they back ability you know and

555
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:40,460
that's what people who step into your

556
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:44,650
personal space won't then won't you back

557
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:50,650
off because I dominate

558
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:54,640
oh the nice thing when you don't you

559
00:37:50,650 --> 00:38:01,780
just called their bluff if they're

560
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:06,220
karate expert yeah okay then we get all

561
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,140
the yo girl touches another secret and I

562
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,600
know you'll go wait we've heard the

563
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,390
condition but you need to hear more in

564
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,470
practicing is when you're talking with

565
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:19,900
somebody you want to show that that you

566
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:23,740
trust and that you're with in tune with

567
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:28,330
them is that you want to echo back to

568
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:32,109
them what they said paraphrasing you

569
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:41,500
know if they go I like you like you like

570
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:44,230
blue you know it's appreciated blue yeah

571
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,950
so what happens is you want to be

572
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:52,090
careful and not regurgitate what they

573
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:55,419
just said but to play off of what they

574
00:38:52,090 --> 00:39:00,540
say one of the best bet ways to do this

575
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:03,520
is a read about Raj Aryan Aryan Theory

576
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,230
Rogers news to God it was a real popular

577
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:11,770
and what he basically did is he just

578
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:16,630
mirrored back what the person sand and a

579
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:20,920
beautiful loving Perry way in the

580
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:24,100
chemical they wrote a computer program

581
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,050
to do this back in the seventies and had

582
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,230
people talk on them they said all the

583
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:33,210
counselors were tied up so you you can

584
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,210
use this tournament this was back

585
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:39,359
and you could use the terminal to talk

586
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,700
to one of them who is across campus but

587
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,190
he can't get here time meeting and

588
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,109
people would and when they got done they

589
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,869
then had a little survey so everybody

590
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:52,200
ended with yeah we would like to talk to

591
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:55,349
them it was a computer software program

592
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,439
that was using this technique of

593
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:02,430
mirroring it felt good they wanted to

594
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,289
come back

595
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,180
have some more counseling session from

596
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:09,150
that person that's really important

597
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,430
these days too because people just want

598
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,440
to be heard you know we don't have the

599
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,788
FaceTime we don't have to sit and have

600
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,140
dinner time anymore and to just be able

601
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:21,539
to make a statement and have somebody

602
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,279
hear you and you hear that they

603
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,950
understood what you said and what you

604
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,410
meant it's just a good thing yes

605
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,450
totally in that place time that's

606
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,250
missing a lot of things mean yeah I'm on

607
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,319
Facebook a lot and I would poke my

608
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,349
friends really

609
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:41,440
it last year one called battle and he

610
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:44,740
said did you just drop a bomb and then

611
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,569
leave and watch what happens

612
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:51,999
I want that one yes it is what I did it

613
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:54,299
I just want you to go crazy with each

614
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,299
other

615
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:05,220
so anyway okay so we talked about

616
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,960
mirroring and be subtle about it

617
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:10,470
your target will believe that you're

618
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,470
insane

619
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:24,120
now you'd return to make a caring and

620
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:28,140
loving connection yes I'm not you got

621
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:33,660
information I want why do I want it I

622
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:41,210
can sell it and make money now why do I

623
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:45,450
want to make money over time yeah okay

624
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:50,250
so this goes along with why we be kind

625
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:54,259
of grouped talking about is make the

626
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:54,260
target your center of attention

627
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:13,069
I had a beautiful 70 school you know

628

4head 4head can give a signal you're

658
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:44,149
done well another trick is to look at

659
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:50,230
the left eye look at the right eye look

660
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,230
at the mouth you don't have to go

661
00:44:53,089 --> 00:45:00,679
that's not soda what a big face you bet

662
00:44:55,609 --> 00:45:03,499
yes you also don't have to move your

663
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:06,859
eyes at all you don't want to be moved

664
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:13,788
across you just refocus your eyes so now

665
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:16,669
you're focusing so but you want to work

666
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:18,669
on that the focusing of your eyes gives

667
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:22,129
a softness to you

668
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:26,359
it also shows that you are listening

669
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:27,949
that that person is the greatest person

670
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,219
in the world to talk to them you

671
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:33,559
listening these are all the techniques

672
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:35,630
that are being used but you have to

673
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,699
temper the eye contact so you don't look

674
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,259
aggressive with it it's kind of like my

675
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:42,039
dogs look at want to know that the first

676
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:44,150
one to break the gaze is the subordinate

677
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,939
you've got to learn to do it carefully

678
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,679
glance away then look back again or make

679
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:51,379
it look natural right just have a

680
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:54,519
staring contest but by doing it like we

681
00:45:51,380 --> 00:46:01,090
were doing you don't want to just yeah

682
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:03,970
saw I can see your face

683
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:07,300
I don't have to move my eyeballs to do

684
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,549
that I can really focus so that works

685
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,710
real well

686
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:18,150
another key techniques to use number

687
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:20,620
eleven is laughter people want black

688
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,870
people love to be the group with

689
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,730
everybody laughing you know is one of

690
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:31,240
the great things that that we do

691
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:34,870
laughter watch when people laugh and a

692
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:38,439
group you if a joke is told and

693
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:40,420
everybody's laughing now you're you

694
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:44,320
found your target you've identified your

695
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:48,220
target watch your target who do they

696
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:54,270
look at when they start to laugh that

697
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:54,270
person is the person they trust the most

698
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:02,020
now guess what you found secondary

699
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,020
target

700
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:13,430
and you found the target that your

701
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:20,920
target primary target trust didn't know

702
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:20,919
them in road to this person

703
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:28,130
but it's all keyed on that second people

704
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:31,909
laughs who they look at now they don't

705
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:37,939
look at anybody that tells you a bunch

706
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:40,759
of stuff - okay one of the things you

707
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:42,969
want to do how many y'all like meeting

708
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,969
new people

709
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,659
[Music]

710
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:55,039
yeah yeah I was telling rangy earlier

711
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:57,469
one of my best assignments out and ugly

712
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:02,329
I had a command post how would the only

713
00:47:57,469 --> 00:48:06,709
one in it big window ten hours of day no

714
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:09,829
we're both great anyway got to look out

715
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:19,069
across the desert you know seeing the

716
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:22,929
people and no matter how uncomfortable

717
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:22,929
you are practice

718
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:33,779
practice two things will happen one you

719
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:37,859
will develop confidence yourself and

720
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:41,640
found out it gets easier to do secondly

721
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:44,299
your target will believe that what

722
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,739
you're saying is true

723
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:55,380
meaningful and they will trust you

724
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:58,169
because you are confident okay one of

725
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:01,079
the things you always want to do is it

726
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:06,929
salespeople do this beautifully is to

727
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:10,669
offer options but not ten options not

728
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:14,160
what do you want to do maximal is three

729
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:18,868
now in this step even one of those

730
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:23,308
threes you can live with yeah again

731
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:27,089
you're not doing this to help you so

732
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:34,049
always give options and make it feel

733
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:47,038
that they picked the right option you

734
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:50,880
know you know okay now situation

735
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:53,699
awareness this is both of offensive

736
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,999
indecent defensive tool is to know

737
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:59,729
what's happening around you if there was

738
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:04,198
a fire broke out right now which door

739
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:08,098
would you go go for yeah therefore

740
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:10,640
they're there most people want to be

741
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:14,660
given up here I'm going out there

742
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,890
right there fine I'll take care we'll

743
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:22,279
unstack the body's lighter you know

744
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:23,990
always know what's happened how many

745
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:27,799
times have you been in a place and just

746
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:28,700
had a bad vibe about it just don't feel

747
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:32,150
right

748
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:34,430
can you go I'm out here okay worried

749
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,589
that I was in Mexico see my time had

750
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:40,098
half the day off so I went down to the

751
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:45,589
natural museum I went to the zoo and you

752
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:50,260
know who cares in Spanish you know I

753
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:53,328
could tell you know a canoe from 1500 is

754
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,250
you know had a great time it was getting

755
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:58,579
dark sign Eid to get back to the hotel

756
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:03,670
so but as I'm walking I see a shortcut

757
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:07,039
to my hotel to the salary and I go no

758
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,859
trash bins perfect hiding place through

759
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:12,309
out code there that

760
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:15,969
in place I spotted it about four I took

761
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:18,749
the long way did I say anything

762
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:22,209
no except for that that was enough so

763
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:29,410
understand your situation now as you're

764
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:31,808
watching people people who think quickly

765
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:37,749
but have sloppy handwriting tend to be

766
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:43,779
smartest general okay the other thing is

767
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:47,709
watch how your target treats service

768
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:49,660
that's like at a restaurant you'll be

769
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:56,788
surprised have the meaning a lot of

770
00:51:49,660 --> 00:52:01,229
people are toward service staff and

771
00:51:56,789 --> 00:52:01,229
we've had Frances working restaurant

772
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,690
be nice but anyway the thing is you can

773
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,140
tell a lot about your target character

774
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:15,440
by the way they treat me okay

775
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:21,589
it tells you how they will treat

776
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:25,620
subordinate people leverage to get in

777
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:28,920
watch people who are really good at two

778
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,500
languages or more they have a tendency

779
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:36,030
to change personalities when they slip

780
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:39,900
into the other language we saw this just

781
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:41,940
the other day yes yeah yesterday there's

782
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,970
a so we like Mexican food

783
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:47,010
so we at this favorite Mexican

784
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,930
restaurant there was a table next to us

785
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:51,990
and you could tell when they slipped

786
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:55,919
into Spanish it with me yeah you know

787
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:58,140
they all had fun personality really

788
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,350
lightens up how many people do you know

789
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:04,830
who speak German

790
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:08,220
watch it can be all serious shapes like

791
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:14,700
much clearer you know we just fun to

792
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:18,419
watch anyone lately so uh what do you

793
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:22,140
have here well the one I like people

794
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:24,359
look more excited about

795
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,710
you know someone's up droning about

796
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,480
something that they don't care about

797
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,190
they're gonna look a little down trodden

798
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,309
but if you've ever talked to someone

799
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:35,059
about their passion whether it's their

800
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:37,109
job or hobby or whatever it might be

801
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:38,039
they're going to line up and they're

802
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:40,769
going to they're going to hold

803
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:44,249
themselves differently so that's just a

804
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:47,669
fun thing to look out for exactly

805
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:50,720
so again as you're stirring the

806
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:55,489
conversation you steer it toward what

807
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:59,488
interests is piped move backpack

808
00:53:55,489 --> 00:54:02,249
computers technology why'd you get

809
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:05,579
excited and start telling you more and

810
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:08,660
go and watch how you might even get

811
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,660
closer lean

812
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:17,440
all tricks of the truck go ahead

813
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:20,470
not much oh when you come upon people

814
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,850
like in a group and you kind of feel

815
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:24,939
like an outsider you want to break into

816
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:26,950
the conversation look at the industry if

817
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,870
there's big turn away from you even if

818
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,029
they're facing you they're turning

819
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:32,259
they're blocking you away sometimes

820
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,880
they'll even turn their body a bit

821
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,530
that's blocking you from the

822
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,780
conversation they're not accepting you

823
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:41,500
into the group but if their feet turn

824
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:43,210
towards you like welcoming you that

825
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,490
means that they're very open to you

826
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,470
joining the group that's really fun to

827
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:50,470
watch it an office situation and it can

828
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:53,500
help you when you're you're talking with

829
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:56,439
people whether you know you can stay in

830
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:01,230
push or yes they have just one to say

831
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,230
hello you know catch on next time

832
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,939
they'll think oh he's respectful

833
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,160
black X on the Vienna so okay Oh

834
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:27,170
yes the deep thing that you were talking

835
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:31,339
about I found that if you if your stand

836
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:35,269
up if you're talking with somebody in

837
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:37,910
here facing them up if they're total

838
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:40,308
stranger it's kind of impatient to be

839
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,019
like this but if I was gonna stand and

840
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:44,539
talk with you for a while and I wanted

841
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:45,500
us defeat I wanted you to feel like we

842
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:48,140
were all friends

843
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,910
I turned my side to you like this and I

844
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,339
wish I would start talking with you like

845
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,319
like this so we're kind of looking at

846
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:56,240
things out here and we're just we're

847
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,730
talking like old friends particularly on

848
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,160
a neighbor or a friend or somebody that

849
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,200
they've known for years comes up and

850
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,569
join us the conversation I'll make sure

851
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,480
that that friend is across from us the

852
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:15,519
entire hour shoulder to shoulder

853
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:15,519
excellent way to do it go ahead

854
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:25,640
good next line yeah Oh basically the key

855
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:30,170
takeaway is power communication how it

856
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:33,650
works how you can use it is an excellent

857
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:36,440
weapon for social engineers the other

858
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:39,320
thing is positive leadership a group

859
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:43,480
will follow the leader now that doesn't

860
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:46,730
mean necessarily the person in charge a

861
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:49,930
lot of times in a group the leader is

862
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,930
the second or even third

863
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:56,089
you can learn they're really the leaders

864
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:59,060
that group oh no next thing I think it's

865
00:56:56,089 --> 00:57:02,869
who we found follow this stuff but

866
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:04,940
questions then great we've been talking

867
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:07,460
about them as we went along in case you

868
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:11,089
have anything else the other thing is

869
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:15,050
