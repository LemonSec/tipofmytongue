1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:10,650
hi everybody sees some people know me

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,370
I'm mark this is the password game show

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,230
we did this a couple years ago basically

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,279
the same thing again except totally

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,400
different we use the Adobe password

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,939
leaked they leaked 150 million user

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,240
accounts and the accounts had their

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:35,000
emails their passwords and their hashes

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,040
were done an unsalted three disks and so

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,750
we are able to see all the collisions of

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
all the passwords between all the

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,170
accounts and then the other part of the

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,890
leak was all the hints and so the

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,899
collisions that have tons of hence you

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,149
can try and figure out exactly what the

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:09,360
password is and it's a fun game so

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:11,850
that's what it is so one second here so

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,900
this was me looking at some of the

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:23,548
random ones here death blank like like

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,530
like death meat poison snake so this one

21
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,439
happens to be snake I don't know what

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,450
death snake is a thing but this and

23
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,850
they're just like some other ones that I

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,530
thought were interesting like like all

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,919
these people from Italy apparently are

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,759
using the same password it's definitely

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,759
something weird or

28
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:49,679
or like this one is their old number or

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,689
this one I really like this is their

30
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:55,869
their initials and the last word their

31
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,189
social security number and so like I'm

32
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:59,289
running this script right now to like

33
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,538
get all the collisions so if I get a few

34
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:06,579
more collisions on this one I mean I

35
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:11,440
would know that person so so yeah they

36
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:14,590
say persons date of birth and then a lot

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,109
of them have yahoo password or whatever

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,670
and so when they are collisions you real

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,319
not only do you have their password here

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,599
it makes it very obvious like hey maybe

41
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,040
I should go there and look for more

42
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:29,109
passwords so lots of interesting things

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,560
so when we did this two years ago the

44
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,430
night before I built like 12 buzzers of

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,519
which 8 worked and we had some fun you

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,519
built and apparently toilet fill all but

47
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,590
yeah I remember lots of people help but

48
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,040
like it all things in my life I take all

49
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,040
the credit

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:58,690
so this time around I did not do that

51
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,790
I had like a month before the con I was

52
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,239
like I'm gonna get ahead and do stuff

53
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,370
and then like basically work kicked my

54
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,350
ass all last month and I did all of this

55
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,660
at 6:00 in the morning today so if you

56
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,160
guys go to Freaknik

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:25,139
or OPM net on your phone and then turn

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:26,859
the volume all the way up Freaknik dot

59
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,560
rld in.net

60
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,419
stands for a really long domain name

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,579
dunno and then you just type in whatever

62
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:40,650
handle you want for the game and then

63
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,650
any one of y'all can hit buzz oh my

64
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,978
[Music]

65
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:11,490
well it also will tell us he was deposed

66
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:12,990
together over here so fake so anyways

67
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,480
the way we're gonna do the game is a

68
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,489
little bit different this year does

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,950
everybody here know the like million

70
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,679
dollar password or whatever we're like

71
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:27,479
the people like really about pyramid

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,150
yeah very similar so one person is

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,400
trying to communicate an idea

74
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:36,270
oh it's up Freaknik

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:45,109
ROV n or net a really long domain name

76
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:45,109
done network are correct you see a page

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,190
okay so the way they begins to work

78
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,190
madam

79
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,999
so as you can see when you pass in that

80
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,439
buzzes a lot of people buzz event right

81
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:12,800
now I just definitely shouldn't put it

82
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:17,059
in the lockout feature I trust these

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,990
guys it won't be ridiculous so Matt has

84
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:23,330
as the password and he has all the hints

85
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,849
and he's going to try to read off as

86
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:30,289
many hits as he can without anyone being

87
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:44,089
able to guess the password and if I show

88
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:48,430
you guys I also did not screen any of

89
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,430
these I got all over me

90
00:05:49,860 --> 00:06:11,529
okay filters on Instagram today this is

91
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:28,779
my favorite one so far okay so Matt if

92
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:31,270
you could read off so if you think you

93
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,339
know it you're gonna fund it and then

94
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,599
we'll see if you know it if not you'll

95
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:45,729
be shamed or premature

96
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:46,709
yes yeah that one okay so you take a

97
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,240
hint

98
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:58,379
all right so they got to make up the

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:07:01,379
password and the hints are a software

100
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,379
program

101
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,909
nope nope shame shame if there's a next

102
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:33,270
time
