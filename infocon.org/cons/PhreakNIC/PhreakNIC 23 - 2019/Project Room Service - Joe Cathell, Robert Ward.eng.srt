1
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:10,530
all right thanks for coming everybody

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:15,150
this is project room service and a

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,269
little introduction so my name is Robert

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:24,419
ward this is my bio that I wrote five

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:28,319
minutes ago so in my day job I'm a

6
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:32,189
software developer so I wrote most for

7
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:37,890
what you're gonna see today and this is

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:39,660
Joe Joe by day is a security analyst who

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,700
helps keep all of your medical data is

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:47,279
secure if you go to Washington

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:54,030
University for any sort of an ailment so

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,620
what is project room service the does

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,120
anyone else take way too much with

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,040
them when they travel like especially

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,870
electronics and gives my us and stuff

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,560
like that so we were sitting around

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:11,460
after DEFCON a couple weeks ago talking

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,990
about like it's just a pain to get there

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,939
and have to set everything up and have

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,929
all this trouble plugging everything in

21
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:22,380
well drinking beer yeah that goes here

22
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:25,579
that goes without saying so the goal of

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,280
room service was to put all this stuff

24
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,710
into this for the record that that's a

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,249
photo of our hotel room at freakin 19 I

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,908
think everything that we had on the tour

27
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:40,499
beds you can see lots of gear obviously

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,549
if you look really closely I'm actually

29
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:47,369
mid Linux install on my laptop there so

30
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,679
basically when we check into a hotel we

31
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,319
spend hours hooking up our own little

32
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:54,619
private land in the hotel room before we

33
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,579
can actually sit down and relax and

34
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,289
project room service is less about

35
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,359
trying to reduce the amount of crap but

36
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,829
more streamlining it just if you look

37
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,919
closely in that picture among the things

38
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,609
you can see multiple laptops multiple

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,310
raspberry PI's Wi-Fi pineapple

40
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,130
Perdue bunch of tools like that multiple

41
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,920
tablets hard drives more than we would

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,510
ever actually hook up during a weekend

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,760
here but we bring it anyway because

44
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,109
probably compulsory yeah

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:33,890
gadget guys or something like that so

46
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,100
what was our goal with the project there

47
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,100
we go

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,780
I heard it's project goals so we wanted

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,429
to be able to hook up a small land you

50
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,830
know in the hotel room so that would get

51
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,870
enacted all of our devices have the

52
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,720
internet feed be from the hotel Wi-Fi or

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,760
land wherever is provided gets us around

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,440
any kind of device limit in some hotels

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,959
they say okay you only have two devices

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,640
or something like that we can plug

57
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,910
everything we have we wanted an

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,140
instant-on VPN access because usually we

59
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,340
go to hacker conferences and we don't

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:17,410
trust any of you plus you know video

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,750
screen to the TV so we've got a little

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,359
Media Center in there on everything

63
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,140
accessible by a touchscreen interface so

64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,760
that we can for simplicity sake and like

65
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,779
I said media storage so there's a hard

66
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,019
drive in there for plenty of media

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,260
storage so decided maybe notice if we

68
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,849
had like some sort of security system so

69
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,569
that we know if somebody entered the

70
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:42,880
hotel room out even if it's just the

71
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,738
cleaning staff but you know we're

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,600
clearly we bring a lot of expensive

73
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,670
equipment with us we'd like to keep it

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,590
somewhat safe or at least notice or have

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:56,108
someone notify us if it is been stolen

76
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,480
and have any kind of events or things

77
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:08,049
triggered by the on the win by a

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:11,370
notification via email so other design

79
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,930
goals as far as physical construction

80
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,579
wanted everything to be able to look

81
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,120
easily accessible so we can get in

82
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,320
repair stuffs while comments if need be

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,150
ruggedness we wanted to put it in like a

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,849
big sturdy case so we want everything in

85
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,200
there to be fairly secure as well just

86
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,370
the case we don't want just the case of

87
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,099
survive you want the hardware engine

88
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,020
inside to survive as well upgradability

89
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,660
you know this was just kind of the first

90
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,460
phase of the project idea we had we want

91
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,830
to be able to expand it out add even

92
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,500
more gadgets and gizmos to the whole

93
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,849
thing and of course ease of use because

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,620
like I said the whole point in the

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:51,169
project is just to come in plug in

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,570
and go and have that be that so this is

97
00:04:51,169 --> 00:05:01,729
what we came up with you can kind of see

98
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:07,310
the top-down picture there Joe so you

99
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:09,500
can kind of see we've got got the

100
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,169
touchscreen some storage for wires

101
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,330
storage for the camera over there a

102
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,070
power supply a bunch of other stuff Joe

103
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,949
and Joe will talk about this more in

104
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,710
detail we've got our own little mini

105
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:24,380
raspberry pi server rack right here with

106
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,180
a few extra spots for when we want to

107
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,190
add stuff how many pods are in there

108
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,150
just two right now and we have space

109
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,070
with three more space and power which I

110
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,570
think we've tested if we add all five

111
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,229
and we would have to put in a bigger

112
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,710
switch but should that shouldn't be too

113
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,710
big of a deal

114
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,260
so next up

115
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,500
yeah so going over some of the hardware

116
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,490
choices I would think first off we

117
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,170
basically have a big kind of multi port

118
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,850
USB charger I'm sure a lot of us have

119
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:08,080
these at home for $50 phones and devices

120
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,930
and stuff usually I got a couple of

121
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,370
bankers at home I found this one though

122
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,630
a particularly designed Adhan

123
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,820
specifically because it's got this

124
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,560
little elit LCD that shows you the power

125
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,790
draw on each port and we thought that

126
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,040
you know we've got a lot of stuff

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,950
plugged in that way beginning to have so

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,050
we went with that also the goal of this

129
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,039
was to have as much power on USB as

130
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,630
possible well both of us do a lot of

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,350
dabbling and electronics and building

132
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,330
stuff engineering power supplies is not

133
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,270
one of my strong suits or nor is it Bob

134
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,370
so we thought if we keep did a USB all

135
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,120
the way through for the first round that

136
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,470
would keep things nice and simple so

137
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,200
obviously there's also a couple of

138
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,830
raspberry PI's in there they're simple

139
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:58,210
cheap again USB powered we thought about

140
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,979
going with Pi fours but we weren't sure

141
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,380
that the power brick would give the

142
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,810
appropriate output to run the PI 4 at

143
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,400
full power so we stuck with PI threes

144
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,350
because for what we're using it for it's

145
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,719
good enough they'll run the media server

146
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,330
in a future upgrade we want to look at

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,670
upgrading to PI fours but that's gonna

148
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,800
be the next revision plus we are I

149
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,300
already had several of these citizen

150
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,000
around so that's saved on cost next up

151
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,710
is the display when we first looked at

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,750
this we looked at it was either this or

153
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,729
the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen

154
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,100
display and we were thinking about the

155
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,060
official PI display just because for

156
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,350
accessibility we were like alright

157
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,460
here's the piece you go get because we

158
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,140
want other people to be able to build

159
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,210
this but the more we looked at it this

160
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,450
device I found on Amazon has a higher

161
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,940
resolution as well is it being driven by

162
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,710
HDMI cables to the thin little ribbon

163
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,710
cable came into play with the

164
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,739
rugged ability I was worried about that

165
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:03,380
cable being damaged versus the SD HDMI

166
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,780
cable being a little more bright also

167
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,920
with the Raspberry Pi display that have

168
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,630
been shortened I mean you get longer

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,970
cables with those ribbon cables but

170
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,520
you're really kind of limited in length

171
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,710
so it would have really affected our

172
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,370
design placement where we wanted to

173
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,950
everything at all so this was cheaper at

174
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,410
$50 versus the other monitor with the

175
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,740
official PI displays about getting us

176
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,350
and what's wearing name on that I really

177
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,690
had a brand name then but you'll see at

178
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,340
the end I do have build materials of all

179
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,229
the parts we cope with Amazon everything

180
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,700
was purchased off in Amazon except the

181
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,590
acrylic and hardware I went to Lowe's

182
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:47,060
and so that will be posted online with

183
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,770
everything else the hard drive so

184
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,469
obviously since rugged ability we don't

185
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,470
want spinning rust in there we wanted an

186
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,900
SSD and the choice of SSD was pretty

187
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,380
simple I've got a good friend who is an

188
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,180
ax drug data recovery experts she also

189
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,560
recently gave a presentation at this

190
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,410
past year's Def Con in the hardware

191
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,410
hacking village so I said hey what's the

192
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:12,500
best SSD for my use case she said

193
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,350
Samsung t5 I said okay that's what we

194
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,200
want this I only went with 500 gigs

195
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,150
peasant's thought about going a full gig

196
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,530
or terabyte but I was like yeah how much

197
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,209
binge-watching can I really do in a

198
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,459
weekend especially when I'm supposed to

199
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,570
be out of the conference I probably

200
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,870
could still do quite a bit but I think

201
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:33,580
500 gigs is still going to be enough

202
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,580
it's just a trick that not all

203
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,980
we're going to go for again the official

204
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,100
Raspberry Pi camera model we thought

205
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,200
about we want to put a cup on a camera

206
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,700
to the surveillance system but again we

207
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,350
have the same ribbon cable issues with

208
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,540
screen also limited placement just like

209
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,560
with the screen so that meant we would

210
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,959
have all right do we attach it to

211
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,640
another PI like a PI zero then we're

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,830
adding additional PI's how do you

213
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,740
connect it can't do it over USB it's got

214
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,770
to be either Wi-Fi or suffer or hook up

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,900
that dongle it was it wasn't going to be

216
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:10,270
as simple solution so Bob found this

217
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,020
online and you know it's a megapixel

218
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,430
resolution it's got IR night mode and a

219
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,220
really long ago that's designed to be a

220
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,829
security camera and with the really long

221
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,450
cable we could like we weren't limited

222
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,980
by where the plugs were in the hotel

223
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,420
room we could hook it up and then move

224
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,670
the camera somewhere else kind of run

225
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:32,079
the cable a little bit and make sure

226
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,569
it's pointed at the door and then kind

227
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,830
of one of the more important pieces is

228
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,750
this network switch you gotta put these

229
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,690
PI's up together there's only so much on

230
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,410
the little travel router so this is a 10

231
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,830
100 megabit USB switch five port that

232
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:51,130
runs off a micro USB I mean I don't

233
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,420
think it's like full duplex but again

234
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,970
it's one of those hey it's good enough

235
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,099
things it's just it's super tiny and

236
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,920
something you could throw in your bag I

237
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,270
really like the idea of it so I do here

238
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,949
in one of my back but there's also kind

239
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,130
of perfect for this because again USB

240
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,960
powered we don't have to mess with any

241
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,880
designing any kind of power supply or

242
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,640
anything like that but if you do need

243
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,740
something faster there is actually

244
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,569
gigabit port on the router which we'll

245
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,670
get to in a minute meeting our own eye

246
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,350
not super exciting but I was coming I

247
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,620
was excited when I found this we went

248
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,120
back

249
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,490
fourth on GUI include remote for the

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,400
Media Center does that mean guys so I

251
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,020
are is it gonna hair to like try to

252
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,029
mimic the codes of the television in the

253
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,069
hotel room but then I found this one

254
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,750
when I was searching online it's yeah

255
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,160
it's meteor remote but it's basically

256
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,870
functions as a wireless keyboard

257
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,540
so it's 2.4 gigahertz over a little

258
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:47,710
Wi-Fi dongle which got rid of any IR

259
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,209
things they'd have to use the app and as

260
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,529
you can see on one side there's actually

261
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,050
a little mini chording keyboard with a

262
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,550
trackpad plus it's got like a gyroscopic

263
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,260
Mouse that you can turn on and off and

264
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,520
it's so all the media functions are just

265
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,920
going through the media keys on keyboard

266
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,010
like when you hit function f2 to hit

267
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,990
play and pause on your laptop so I was

268
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,319
really kind of tickled by that it was

269
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,960
like 80 bucks or something like that

270
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,790
it's pretty cheap and so it was a lot of

271
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:19,120
we were really excited to find it and

272
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,620
then the router this is really kind of

273
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,600
the heart and soul of the whole thing

274
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,560
it almost we've been kicking around this

275
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,610
idea in some form or fashion for years

276
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,890
every time basically every time we have

277
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,570
a trip and we pack all of our gear but

278
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,069
this thing to kind of almost tank the

279
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,250
project from the start because it's so

280
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,930
versatile anybody ever seen this I know

281
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:43,060
they're pretty popular now are getting

282
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:46,599
popularity it's from a GUI net model

283
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,930
number Gio ar7 5 0 s if you want to look

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,380
it up it is an open work based router

285
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:56,410
it's got three gigabit ports on it yeah

286
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,060
ac and under into one Wi-Fi 128

287
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,390
megabytes of RAM micro SD card so you

288
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:04,420
cannot load files and stuff onto it

289
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,100
again USB powered micro USB and I it's

290
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,250
kind of designed to be hackable like you

291
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,650
can open it up and you've got access to

292
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,450
the antennas so you can replace the

293
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,130
antennas I think there's even like like

294
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,890
a TTL connection over so you can

295
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,500
actually hook up and use a serial

296
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,390
connection they really wanted to be

297
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,800
tactical winning

298
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,740
made these little things and it's about

299
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,209
I was 80 bucks I think and so again it's

300
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,440
another essential even if you don't

301
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,510
build one of these just an essential

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:41,040
travel router really handy so this is

303
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,660
the whole bill of materials we actually

304
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,339
didn't put the fans in this version

305
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,949
we've thought about cooling fans and

306
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,760
this Ida it's gonna be open should have

307
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:54,690
plenty of airflow it didn't come out

308
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,890
quite as cheap as we want current

309
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,260
tallies about six hundred and

310
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,330
thirty-eight dollars we were a little

311
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,650
sticker shocked by that because it's you

312
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,180
know there's a bunch of them everything

313
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,010
every piece is under a hundred bucks

314
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,510
over life and this will be pretty

315
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:21,720
inexpensive no not so much but uh pay

316
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:23,520
for a fun project anyway anyway so just

317
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,380
kind of going over the the off-the-shelf

318
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,819
software there's a little bit of custom

319
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,860
stuff for this but a lot of its just

320
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,860
kind of plug-and-play parts we put

321
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,860
together the media centers the first one

322
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,000
it's just a standard kind of

323
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:43,440
off-the-shelf Coby install pulling media

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,720
off of the local driver you you have to

325
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,330
make sure that your media is transcoded

326
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,490
correctly to get hardware decoding on

327
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,040
the pie so that's kind of a little bit

328
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,990
of a pain you got to make sure it's

329
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,370
h.264 I think and then then it works

330
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,050
pretty well but if you're trying to

331
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,790
decode something the pie doesn't have

332
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,780
native support for it just kind of

333
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:07,319
chokes but it works well it works great

334
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,990
with the with the media remote we've got

335
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,580
an external port drilled into this so

336
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,400
it's really easy to plug in the HDMI

337
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,110
cable run it up to the TV and then

338
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
you've got your own little private media

339
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,730
center you're now

340
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,670
about you know whatever weird thing the

341
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,990
hotel has for you the router is talking

342
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,300
a little bit about this offer on this

343
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,920
Joe Joe touched on it this thing is

344
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,280
really slick you if you connect to it

345
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,439
directly it has a nice little user

346
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,390
interface in that sits in front of the

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,300
the default openwork interface and

348
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:47,330
handles stuff automatically like a VPN

349
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,329
client a VPN server both Open VPN a and

350
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,920
wire guard makes it easy to set it up in

351
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,960
repeater mode which if you've ever tried

352
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,060
to do that with with open work directly

353
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,150
is a huge pain that this just makes it

354
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,800
trivial and then has a convenient lead

355
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,420
to just boost you back into the default

356
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,229
open word interface if you want to do

357
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,420
something like set static DHCP or any

358
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,900
you know more advanced kind of stuff

359
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,930
like that

360
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:15,470
most probably most importantly it's

361
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:18,800
designed to handle splash pages when you

362
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,300
connect to guest Wi-Fi networks so when

363
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,099
we connect it to a hotel Wi-Fi it will

364
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,329
break it'll route that page through and

365
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,600
bring it up on whatever device you're

366
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:29,180
browsing on yeah some sub routers will

367
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,610
hijack the DNS and make those kind of

368
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,469
pass through captive portals impossible

369
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,110
this actually has a specific setting to

370
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,800
kind of allow those captive portal and a

371
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,930
DNS redirects through motion I don't

372
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,390
know does anyone here use motion before

373
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,219
the security camera system I have no

374
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,260
experience with it this thing is really

375
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,640
slick it's a very kind of Unix II

376
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,150
security camera tool it just does one

377
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,130
thing it watches a webcam you know a

378
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,839
bunch of configurable options to say you

379
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,750
know watch this type for this type of

380
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,280
motion and then do that and then all of

381
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,670
its other things are call out and do a

382
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,680
script so it's not trying to include all

383
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,100
the batteries and include all sorts of

384
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,510
other stuff it's just watch a webcam and

385
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,569
when you see something do some other

386
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,540
stuff and then it leaves it up to you to

387
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,859
what that other stuff is we have it set

388
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,670
up so that it stores all the videos

389
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,729
locally and cleans them out every

390
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:30,330
for hours and it also posts an alert to

391
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,250
our custom software so that we can send

392
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,439
email alerts and stuff like that but

393
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,630
again all motion is doing is just

394
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,690
calling that script so really kind of

395
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:47,700
great great handy little tool yes yeah

396
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,260
it's it's called motion it is a little

397
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,060
minute it is kind of hard to Google so

398
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,850
make sure it's like motion video

399
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,320
surveillance software or motion because

400
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,969
not even just the motion software then

401
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,129
you get like motion capture software

402
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:04,290
yeah I think most of the mimosa mimosa

403
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,430
Tori's but trying to try and when you're

404
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,840
trying to look it up to find the

405
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,970
documentation that's where it gets

406
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,919
tricky yeah it's right up there with

407
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,860
like looking up grow yes did you look at

408
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:19,500
some minor at all so minder actually

409
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:21,620
uses motion under the hood okay Wow and

410
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,540
yes I have his own minder setup at home

411
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,770
the goal here was we didn't we wanted

412
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,270
everything I'm going to talk about the

413
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,980
custom cell for the minute dependent go

414
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,810
through one user interface so I didn't

415
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,740
want to try to boot so minders interface

416
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:36,330
into something else so I'll talk a

417
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,830
little bit about the custom software if

418
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,960
there's actually not that much it's

419
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,260
probably like twenty five hundred lines

420
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,900
of code total so there's a front-end

421
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,020
react wrap app that's designed to be

422
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,150
touch friendly mobile friendly very

423
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,790
limited functionality you know we're not

424
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,400
trying to replicate everything you could

425
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:59,040
do by you know editing the motion config

426
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,290
or login into the router directly the

427
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,820
goal here was that you can open this

428
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,590
thing up and using that touch screen to

429
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,149
get your system online without getting

430
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:10,800
up your laptop to log into the router

431
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:14,250
and configuring a bunch of stuff the

432
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,200
back end it talks to a node server the

433
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,210
right node software that's my day job so

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,280
you know if you've got a hammer

435
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,280
everything looks like a nail

436
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,470
it proxies through to the router and the

437
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,059
camera feed so that everything goes

438
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,360
through kind of one server hand

439
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,749
authenticate to the server for you so it

440
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,580
just kind of makes all that transparent

441
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:37,950
proxies the camera feed what we'll see

442
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,168
that in the demo in a second then it's

443
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,490
it's just got a handful of utility

444
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:43,590
routes for like two checking if you're

445
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:51,090
on the internet controlling whether or

446
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:53,459
not you get alerts things like that so I

447
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,590
think I'm on time yeah so we're gonna

448
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:04,860
try to do this live prey to the demo

449
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:07,168
gods for us yeah so Joe's already set

450
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,879
this up and plugged it in it's already

451
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,850
powered up and this is what you get when

452
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:14,039
you power it in and it's a little hard

453
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,110
to see here but we've got some

454
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,789
screenshots so you get to the hotel you

455
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,979
power it up this is what you can see

456
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,860
you'd go ahead and hit the connection

457
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,360
tab there and we'd give you a list of

458
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,729
well you've hit the Scan button and a

459
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,580
little refresh in the bottom corner yep

460
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,379
so I've done that see here this is the

461
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:42,178
Status page where work comes up

462
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:43,889
initially thank you so we're gonna go

463
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,389
ahead and scan for Wi-Fi networks see

464
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:47,908
what's up I'm going to go ahead and

465
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:51,059
disconnect once the scan finishes from

466
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,129
the Clarion once so we can demo this we

467
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,749
had to set up earlier once you've

468
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:56,699
connected to a Wi-Fi network it's gonna

469
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:58,399
automatically reconnect this kind of as

470
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,950
you'd expect

471
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,949
so disconnect that

472
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,100
connects to Clarion Inn & Suites

473
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,800
and then of course it would pop up the

474
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,500
password problems if you needed a WPA

475
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,330
key or something like that which we

476
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,070
don't really have a great solution for

477
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,840
that yeah okay so you can see it's

478
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,370
connected but it doesn't actually

479
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,020
connect that we can get up to the

480
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,449
internet that assumes we're on a captive

481
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:38,550
portal so I'm gonna hit the open button

482
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,550
and it's going to open up

483
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,750
I think that's what we've still got

484
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:51,540
cashed the connection so even really

485
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,820
disconnected and reconnected the portal

486
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,250
anyway okay that's one thing that didn't

487
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:01,399
work but it's trying to open up a

488
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:04,710
captive portal doesn't seem to be able

489
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,020
it's not triggering it that's kind of

490
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,970
hit or miss if you've ever tried to use

491
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,620
the the captive portal detection of like

492
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,290
an iPhone or anything like that

493
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,850
it's spotty as to whether or not you can

494
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,649
actually detect when you're trying to be

495
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:22,439
forward into one so back to the status

496
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,690
screen you can see it's going to say

497
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,350
that we're connected now oh that's why I

498
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,420
left the VPN can I do so if the VPN is

499
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,730
connected it works with a kill switch so

500
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,770
it won't allow any traffic that's not on

501
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,560
the VPN so obviously that includes not

502
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,180
letting us out to the taptic portal so

503
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,179
I'm going to go ahead and turn that off

504
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,799
there's a screenshot of you can page

505
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,929
there's you just list the profiles you'd

506
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,889
have installed on there just flip them

507
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:07,309
on and off there we go we're connected

508
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:09,889
to the Internet now the VPN is not

509
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:15,109
connected but that's just a simple

510
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:17,359
toggle switch the security camera it's

511
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:19,789
pretty simple interface you can see

512
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,139
what's on the live view coming from the

513
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,479
camera we've got to sit here point at me

514
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:25,998
and as I'm moving around Bob's probably

515
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:27,349
getting tons of emails right now I have

516
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:34,249
the alerts turned off because I was

517
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:37,570
smart good job so you can see the live

518
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:40,119
view there you can go ahead and turn it

519
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:43,700
takes a little bit to catch up but

520
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:49,449
there's everyone there on the screen if

521
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,450
I now do enable alerts

522
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,330
we promise we won't close down here it

523
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,918
really just

524
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,439
and I waved my hand in front of the

525
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:11,990
camera oh I'm an evil person coming into

526
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:13,610
your room to do something yep this is

527
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:18,019
the part of that the presentation where

528
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:20,479
I check my email it takes a second or

529
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:22,309
two to come through so yeah we

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,639
eventually want to make it so that it'll

531
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:27,350
either text us as well and ideally we

532
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:33,740
want to figure out how to push out over

533
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:35,149
signal maybe okay once you go that's all

534
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,769
it takes to get it set up and then you

535
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:37,580
can kick back watch some movies in the

536
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,990
hotel room

537
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:46,639
and enjoy the rest of the conference

538
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:48,320
there's the if it's actually statement

539
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:58,219
still it tends to look real better as

540
00:24:48,320 --> 00:25:02,389
opposed to yeah the so future goals for

541
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,460
the project right now all the software

542
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:07,070
in stuffs and configured by hand

543
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,450
we built the PI's by hand install the

544
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,820
software we'd like to get some setup

545
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,139
scripts because we are going to open so

546
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:17,029
push it out all of our software and

547
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:18,889
schematics for the components out to

548
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:22,460
github so anybody else can build this if

549
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:24,049
they want we also like to eventually

550
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,879
implement some software plugins we're

551
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:31,129
just trying to figure out how that would

552
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:32,480
look as far as I don't think neither of

553
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,860
us why don't do a whole lot develop at

554
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,899
all but Bob's never developed a plug-in

555
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,090
system before so he's trying to figure

556
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:42,500
that out if anybody wants to help by all

557
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:44,149
means we are actors so we'd like to put

558
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,330
in some like automated like network

559
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:50,649
scanning see if we can detect any like

560
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:52,330
cameras on on the network that may be

561
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,890
like in our rooms or anything like that

562
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,520
like you know this is full projects born

563
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:01,990
out of paranoia so we've toyed around

564
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,940
about building in a UPS and powered

565
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,280
speakers in case you know the speakers

566
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,400
on the TV kind of suck and you just want

567
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,990
to play some tunes thought about it like

568
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,580
a tamper alarm they either like an on

569
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,990
switch or a gyroscope so they have

570
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,090
somebody like picks it up and moves it

571
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,710
while it's running that uh you know

572
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,740
alarm with sound or send us a

573
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,410
notification part part of it as part of

574
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,929
the whole security system

575
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,580
I thought maybe in a group integrating a

576
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:29,140
some kind of smart assistant like

577
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,510
Mycroft or something so we could kind of

578
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,620
have our own kind of problem brew Alexa

579
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:37,390
in the hotel room just complete overkill

580
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,979
we thought about adding you know retro

581
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,140
game system I think Cody has some

582
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,850
emulators available for it that you can

583
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,870
install so you can play some video games

584
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:49,540
- one of the things the router has is

585
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,639
cellular failover if you had a block

586
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,909
cellular modem so you'd like to

587
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,520
implement that and you know if the Wi-Fi

588
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:00,190
drops out you can go ahead and

589
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:04,240
automatically failover to that SDR we're

590
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,420
both hands and radio geeks so we both

591
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,160
kind of want to put a SDR in there

592
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,620
either it was just like an RTL SDR just

593
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,450
kind of scanning and seeing what signals

594
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,939
it picks up be kind of fun just to have

595
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:20,170
it up Waterfalls played on the screen

596
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,650
involves doing that any other sensors we

597
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,840
can think of you know air quality or

598
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,610
stuff like that you know I've got a box

599
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,050
of components so whatever I can find

600
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,939
I'll probably just cram in there at some

601
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,050
point

602
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,910
final shutter server will probably just

603
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,280
do a quick that'll probably one of the

604
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,770
first things we do throw in a like an X

605
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,030
cloud server probably I connected the

606
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,690
kodi server so you can just easily

607
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,840
upload your media as

608
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:47,630
- uh I haven't removed the hard drive -

609
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,540
advisor much then he could share it

610
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,720
share it out over the anybody else

611
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,190
connect to the hotel room self-destruct

612
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,110
I mean who once who doesn't want a big

613
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,090
red button they can press in that case

614
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,189
no distance Wow

615
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,620
so again just have eventually we'd like

616
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,250
to you know do full disk encryption on

617
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,500
the PI's and then you know just have a

618
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,010
big red button that you hit that delete

619
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,180
the keys remove the systems and

620
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,879
everything scrambled and you're good to

621
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,350
go

622
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,150
iron masters kind of really dropped on

623
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,669
bribery since we've got pretty slick

624
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,010
Wi-Fi remote now but it'd still be nice

625
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,320
to turn on the TV the use case for that

626
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,480
would be if we're not using HDMI because

627
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,480
the PI's do have was that

628
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,220
ECE or whatever whatever the extended

629
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,410
protocol for HDMI to give some control

630
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,020
over the TV the PI's do have it and I

631
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,200
think Cody uses it but that might not

632
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,889
work in all situations so like I said

633
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,620
full disk encryption and then uh you

634
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,300
know I designed all the brackets and

635
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,219
mounts and stuff in here I'm

636
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,250
particularly proud of like the the

637
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,290
screen mount and the power brick mount I

638
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,720
wrote a project box generator and

639
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,980
openscad and used them both before that

640
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,550
and I think they came out pretty

641
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,480
slick-looking but some of the other

642
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:08,210
brackets and stuff in there could use

643
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,650
some tweaks I think we could rearrange

644
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,070
things a little bit better get things a

645
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:19,190
little lower profile and so I'd like to

646
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:20,419
work on that as well anyway this isn't

647
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,690
going to be the URL where we're going to

648
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,420
post this it github STL 2600 because Bob

649
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:30,020
and I both present our host of local

650
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:34,030
2600 in st. Louis Missouri at the arch

651
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,030
reactor hacker space all

652
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:40,330
all of the the software is up there now

653
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,039
you can check it out

654
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,740
it's mainly just the custom software and

655
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:47,200
some instructions on setting that up

656
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,929
we'll add all the the files and assembly

657
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,970
instructions kind of as we as we get

658
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,740
them from I've got I've got the document

659
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,289
I've written most of the documentation

660
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,919
for how to set everything up I've also

661
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,870
got all the models for the components if

662
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,470
you so you can print and laser cut them

663
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:08,080
yourself if you have means I intend to

664
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,669
post them this weekend I'm not going to

665
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,590
make that promise because I'm horrible

666
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:17,860
about that kind of stuff questions

667
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:20,709
hey do you intend to make a commercial

668
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,510
version of this in the future uh I don't

669
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,669
think so Bob and I are both I mean it's

670
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,019
all off the shelf of parts aside from

671
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,639
the practice of stuff we really didn't

672
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,600
design any electronics or anything I

673
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,219
don't know if there's anything really

674
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,959
Bob your pen guy is there anything

675
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,720
really patentable in this now I didn't

676
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,490
think so so uh yeah no and we're both

677
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,070
pretty big open-source guys we'd rather

678
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,590
have it open let people do it themselves

679
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:46,178
plus you saw the building materials the

680
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:49,600
cost is in and honestly ninety look like

681
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:51,720
they said 95% of the benefit and the

682
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,000
thing we made this for is in the router

683
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,409
like if you just want a nice easy secure

684
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,269
network you can take with you grab that

685
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:02,380
router and plug it in and it does most

686
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:06,179
of what you need we almost didn't build

687
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,179
this project because that router exists

688
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,330
yes

689
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:22,810
I would let you know I'm looking for

690
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:26,379
glass re yeah no we just finished this

691
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:29,360
this was an empty box yesterday morning

692
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:34,090
here is there is a 3d printer in our

693
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,090
hotel room this printing out mounts

694
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,040
we've been working on in a couple months

695
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,400
here's here's a here's an important tip

696
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:47,180
when you start a big project don't do it

697
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,810
when one of the team party members just

698
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,940
had a kid in both team members buy new

699
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,159
houses and move during the course of the

700
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,070
project that really paints a cramp on

701
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,780
your on your ability to work on projects

702
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:04,070
we should've gone to bed time management

703
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,110
talking for the airport you need a

704
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:12,080
little just one little speaker in there

705
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:17,120
that I tried to convince Bob that we

706
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,949
needed a big countdown clock I am

707
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,419
actually quite curious because last time

708
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,640
last time one was her airport I got a

709
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,440
pie top which didn't have a hard drive

710
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,910
through guess I must have checked it

711
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,970
previous buddy brought it up carry on to

712
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:38,960
Vegas this past year and it they they

713
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,910
put it through the x-ray five times only

714
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,680
by the fourth time I was like I will

715
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,090
disassemble this right here now for it

716
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,500
if you want to take a look inside it

717
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,750
like the panel just slides back it's

718
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,940
really easy well right now we're all

719
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,930
right and so yeah I'm really curious to

720
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,110
see how this goes through please

721
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:59,769
any other questions

722
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,600
yes so I carry ham radio equipment and

723
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,220
computer equipment through through

724
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,289
airport security all the time all I

725
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,289
would say is avoid airports in Texas

726
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:16,169
that's probably fair I used to travel

727
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:18,990
for business probably 15 years ago and

728
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:20,710
even with just a regular toolkit like

729
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,260
airport security

730
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,779
the TSA varies wildly from airport to

731
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,250
airport it like there's no consistency

732
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,299
some of them want to search it some of

733
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,519
them want to search it with you there

734
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,370
some of them don't care some of them

735
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,230
will take your empty butane soldering

736
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,449
iron but leave the butane in the

737
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,279
compressed canister like there's no

738
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,409
rhyme or reason for any of it so yeah

739
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,659
you know the more parts that you take

740
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,570
out and put separated bins and things

741
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:53,309
the better they feel about you yeah

742
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,309
that's true yes

743
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,240
thanks everybody if you want to
