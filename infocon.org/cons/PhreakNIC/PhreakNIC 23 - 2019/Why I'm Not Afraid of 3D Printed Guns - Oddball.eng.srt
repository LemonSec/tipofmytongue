1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:10,860
and sorry if you let sir what was the

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,860
talk that was supposed to be going on

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:20,920
yeah unfortunately Steve had to cancel

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,730
on us so I pulled up a talk that I've

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,210
done a couple times here and updated a

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,550
little bit but yeah why I'm not afraid

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,359
of 3d guns and there are 3d printed guns

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,800
and neither should you

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,170
and I keep saying that I will do a talk

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,959
that doesn't require and I am NOT a

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,210
lawyer speech but this this ain't one of

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,049
them I am gonna talk about a couple

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:49,629
firearms laws but I am NOT a lawyer so

14
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:54,449
don't cite me if you do something stupid

15
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:59,309
to get in trouble just in case if you

16
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,629
haven't known for the past since 2013

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,759
this thing has caused all sorts of

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:09,100
trouble this was the first released 3d

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,530
print completely 3d printed gun except

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,729
for it and you can see there's some

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:21,460
screws on there and this particular one

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:28,140
is chambered in 380 acp a little

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:31,830
single-shot gun put out by Cody Wilson

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,200
called the Liberator and

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:38,350
frankly I think if he had just done this

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,610
and not called it the Liberator nobody

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,759
would have noticed nobody would have

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:48,630
cared does anybody know the namesake of

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,630
the Liberator

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:02:00,289
produced authority to assassinate Nazi

31
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:02,420
yeah this thing which GM came up with

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,400
this wonderful plan of we can stamp out

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,950
a zillion of these guys drop them into

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,160
occupied France and the French

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,690
Resistance can get them load up a 45

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,060
caliber in it and sneak up to a Nazi

37
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,670
soldier pop them in the back of the

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:24,040
heads with that grab these soldiers real

39
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:27,369
gun and run off with an actual firearm

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,600
it's better than a butter knife but

41
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,090
after some testing they figured out that

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,980
you get you're lucky if you can get

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:40,760
through an entire box of ammo without

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:43,450
the seams just separating on you that's

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,890
best crew it only has to work once Oh

46
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,750
incidentally this there there's no

47
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,070
actual documentation of this ever

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,340
actually being used in World War 2 there

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,230
is some documentation of I believe the

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,430
Filipino police carried them for a

51
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,859
little while which is terrifying but I

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:07,640
so that this was the gun to get a gun

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:17,690
for the people resisting the current

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:21,320
government in control so naming your gun

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,180
after such a thing and loudly

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,769
proclaiming that yes

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,799
you knew the connection and that was

58
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:33,320
your intent yeah that makes some

59
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:38,600
governments a little nervous this is the

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,459
Liberator actually ready to fire you can

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,390
see that you went ahead and printed out

62
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:47,140
three barrels because well chances are

63
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,350
he was going to melt one or two of them

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:55,250
and you can see that nail that's the

65
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,799
firing pin very simplistic stuff you

66
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,220
actually have to take the barrel off to

67
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,610
reload the thing so again

68
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,380
yeah if you only need the one shot you

69
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:12,500
can get it but reloading it's gonna take

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:16,219
a little while and where we stand today

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,589
and actually I need to well

72
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,720
that federal lawsuit got settled there's

73
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,929
a cup from there's a couple state

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,410
lawsuits that are still going on saying

75
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:33,710
that yes 3d printed guns are perfectly

76
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:36,440
legal in most states California I think

77
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,739
you have to register room so again check

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:46,100
locals flaws as far as what what it is

79
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:50,020
to build your own firearm and there is

80
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:55,100
still an ongoing lawsuit with New Jersey

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:03,469
that there was just some movement on it

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:06,410
a couple days ago which the distributed

83
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,740
defense which is Cody Wilson's company

84
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,940
is pushing for it to go to the Supreme

85
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,430
Court at this point basically and yeah

86
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:22,790
the 80s from 21 states decided to pile

87
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:26,360
on on the court case and there are some

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,820
weird things like a judge ruled that

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,530
well you can sell the plans but you

90
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,030
can't just post them on the internet for

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,400
anyone to get for free and some other

92
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,890
goofy things and of course in the

93
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:48,200
meantime if you haven't kept up with the

94
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:50,960
news Cody Wilson got caught hiring /

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,430
hooking up with an underage girl through

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,650
website that was called something like

97
00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:00,680
sugar daddies calm or something like

98
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:02,010
that and briefly fled to Thailand I

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,910
believe and

100
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:08,700
and then turned himself in and has since

101
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,150
pleaded guilty to the add-ins currently

102
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,130
sitting in jail cell so defense

103
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,630
distributed is still going on but I

104
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,200
think we're not going to hear a whole

105
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:21,540
lot more from Cody Wilson which which is

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,849
a shame because he's he's said some

107
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:30,480
really wonderful sound bites I touched

108
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:34,880
on the legalities of it a little bit it

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:39,260
is legal to make a firearm without any

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,210
registration sterilization whatever in

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,289
most states as long as you're making it

112
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,549
for yourself if you're making it to sell

113
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,760
you have to you have to go through the

114
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,590
license process of becoming a licensed

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:58,140
firearms manufacturer and all that fun

116
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:00,119
stuff there is one thing that you do

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,000
need to be careful of when you're making

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,140
3d print guns which is the undetectable

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,710
firearms act of 1988 which is largely

120
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,810
because of the movie die hard - they buy

121
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,210
your members die hard - the talk of the

122
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,330
porcelain Glocks that cost more than a

123
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,650
cop's salary and blah blah blah

124
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,479
that caused a bunch of the bunch of

125
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:30,630
lawmakers to be deeply concerned that

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:32,280
such a gun existed which it didn't and

127
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,840
still doesn't yeah to the best of my

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,619
knowledge there is no functioning

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,929
porcelain firearm

130
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,550
but Congress decided that they were

131
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:47,310
scared enough about it that they

132
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,350
actually made a law banning guns that

133
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,890
don't that won't set off metal detectors

134
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,080
and at the time the firearms industry

135
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,210
had other things to worry about than

136
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,870
fighting laws to ban things that didn't

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,820
exist and

138
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,030
they didn't really think effort would

139
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,630
exist so there has to be a certain

140
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,099
amount of ferrous metal in any firearm

141
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:14,040
that you have and similarly any other

142
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,790
gun laws that pertain to where you live

143
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,850
no you can't make a short-barreled rifle

144
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,690
we can't make a machine gun all of that

145
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:27,210
fun stuff

146
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:32,779
and of course there's ITAR because the

147
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:36,990
federal government has decided that this

148
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:40,200
the ability to build this is dangerous

149
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:46,800
enough to be a military secret think

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:49,020
about that for a minute so and that's

151
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,510
actually part of the reasoning behind

152
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,180
the judge saying you can't just post it

153
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,450
on the internet for anyone to download

154
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,859
because well there's no way that you

155
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,620
there's no mechanism for you to make

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:09,300
sure that someone in Iran is not

157
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:13,709
downloading it Yeah right again people

158
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,689
oh no not a single-shot pistol that

159
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:17,279
probably melts on you you know I

160
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,020
wouldn't say that I would say the

161
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,670
Iranian government would be worried

162
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,420
about that

163
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:28,050
right employ and of course other things

164
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,240
consider one is cost since I put since I

165
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,170
originally did this because of 3d

166
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,710
printers has come down considerably I've

167
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:41,699
seen people have produced them on 3d

168
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:48,870
printers that cost 200 bucks but that's

169
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:53,460
still you know no they've successfully

170
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,630
done it apparently you can and I mean

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,900
that's also part of the technical

172
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,820
know-how of you need to know what

173
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:12,930
materials you can use so it doesn't blow

174
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:17,010
up on you and nope ABS plastic yep

175
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,510
and also it's not you might you know a

176
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,180
lot of the news reports make it sound

177
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,910
like it's a Star Trek replicator that

178
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,410
you push a button and out comes a ready

179
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:31,339
guns no you push a button and you wait

180
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,280
half a day and you got a pile of parts

181
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:38,490
and then you need to assemble it and you

182
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,930
need to be able and you know how many

183
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,710
folks in here have played with 3d

184
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:52,290
printers before yeah how twitchy is a 3d

185
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:56,160
printer exactly and as you pointed out

186
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,670
for its durability you're a wit with the

187
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,030
illegalities thing is the for most

188
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,130
pistols and rifles etc for example

189
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,829
you're supposed to have a rifled barrel

190
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm pretty sure her classic rifling will

191
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,370
get smoothed out after that first shot

192
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,370
much less anything else

193
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,149
right yeah and of course without good

194
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:29,529
rifling your accuracy is gonna be crap

195
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:34,029
all right so you have all these things

196
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:37,480
to consider your your spending oh you

197
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,519
know a few hundred dollars you need it's

198
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,029
it's gonna take you a long time to do it

199
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,509
and all this that and the other or you

200
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:50,319
could buy this thing this is a

201
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:51,850
9-millimeter Cobra brand derringer that

202
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:56,649
I picked up for a hundred bucks at a

203
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:01,949
pawn shop as far as actual manufactured

204
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:06,160
pistols go it's a piece of junk that

205
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:09,209
said it does go bang every time I pulled

206
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:14,439
the trigger on it and the bullet does go

207
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:16,449
vaguely where I want it to go I also in

208
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,490
previous presentations I've also put up

209
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:23,099
High Point pistols if anybody's handled

210
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:28,809
those bricks that again you can buy it

211
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:34,480
semi-auto nine-millimeter pistol for 125

212
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:36,279
bucks that usually works and you don't

213
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,769
have and you don't really have to worry

214
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:43,750
about it turning into a grenade in your

215
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:45,129
hand when you pull the trigger so if

216
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,290
there's all these complications and all

217
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:54,059
this that and the other why should I

218
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:59,079
care one a lot of companies are actually

219
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:03,550
blocking this information really yeah if

220
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:07,059
you try to post a post on Facebook right

221
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:11,229
now with two with a link to code is free

222
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:13,480
speech comm which when they weren't in

223
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,069
the middle of a lawsuit with New Jersey

224
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,929
had a bunch of this information on it

225
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:21,860
Facebook's algorithm will automatically

226
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:25,089
block the post and tell you that it

227
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,230
a violation of the Terms of Service I

228
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,820
I've asked them to point out exactly

229
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,730
where in the terms of service and of

230
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,410
course being giant Internet company

231
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,269
they've been extremely silent on the

232
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:43,339
matter also similarly one of my buddies

233
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:46,420
got Amazon to print out the code for the

234
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:50,120
Liberator in book form for a while and

235
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,390
then Forbes did an article on it and

236
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,190
when Forbes reached out to Amazon asking

237
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,079
for comment

238
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:02,750
Amazon's response was basically we're

239
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:06,680
doing what now and pulled the book so

240
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:10,279
and like I said you know there is a

241
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:14,569
brief forward the rest of the text is a

242
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:21,430
little try and difficult at times but if

243
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:24,110
anyone's interested in looking at it and

244
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,300
there is always the question of how do

245
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:31,910
we feel about legally suppressing

246
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:34,699
computer code right now in Australia if

247
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,100
you get caught with possession of the

248
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:40,160
code to print out a 3d printer or a 3d

249
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:45,199
printed to Govan you can get hit with up

250
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:52,040
to fourteen years in jail which i think

251
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:55,370
is a bit extreme and and of course you

252
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:59,899
know we can all see parallels of this

253
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,750
with encryption the sound fort for those

254
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:07,390
of you that remember the encryption Wars

255
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,390
of the 90s a lot of this sound familiar

256
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,260
and like I said you know possession of

257
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:20,630
that book in Australia could get me 14

258
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:24,380
years in jail and of course finally the

259
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:27,500
cats out of the bag the first one the

260
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,230
first 3d printed gun like I said was

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,490
shown off and

262
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:35,520
20:13 when was last time you saw anybody

263
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,770
successfully suppressed technology

264
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,780
especially from people that want to do

265
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:44,699
bad things with it it's out there there

266
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,530
unfortunately have been a couple

267
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,320
instances where the police have have

268
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:56,430
found 3d printed guns in the hands of

269
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,650
criminals I saw actually speaking on

270
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:04,160
Australia I saw one article a couple

271
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:09,329
days ago where the police claimed that a

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:14,250
drug a drug gang had 3d printed machine

273
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:18,000
guns now of course I will put the caveat

274
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,600
on it that if anybody has paid attention

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,940
to how the press reports firearms on

276
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,920
firearms whether it was actually a

277
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,440
machine gun or not and whether it was

278
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:40,589
functional at all or not is always

279
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:42,240
questionable so you know it even if

280
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,220
you're not really all that interested in

281
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,510
printing this stuff out it is something

282
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,510
to think about and something to watch

283
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,900
and of course since then things have

284
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:01,020
gotten a little bit more advanced this

285
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:04,760
is a 22 revolver that I'm sure a bunch

286
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:11,160
of you could see the resemblance to a

287
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:13,560
certain item in the toys toy aisle by

288
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,870
the way if anybody's interested this is

289
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:21,659
no down here yeah it's it's a bitmap and

290
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,229
if you run it through and look at it as

291
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,780
a text well there's some code there

292
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:33,010
hmm so if anybody is interested I can

293
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:35,540
give you a copy afterwards and also

294
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:40,429
lately there's been a bunch of people 3d

295
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:46,750
printing ar-15 magazines and Glock

296
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:51,770
lowers and all sorts of fun stuff and

297
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:54,380
this is a pretty good close-up of a gun

298
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:59,750
that I thought was really neat just

299
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:03,950
because I liked the zigzag pattern of

300
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:09,140
zigzag revolvers unfortunately this

301
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:15,110
particular one was printed up by a man

302
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:17,270
in Japan and there's some footage of him

303
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,360
firing it with black powder that he

304
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,220
swears up and down he didn't put any he

305
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:27,020
didn't put a pellet in it or anything

306
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:30,380
but in Japan firearms are pretty much

307
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:35,090
banned outright so he went to jail for

308
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:38,059
it so like I said make sure you know

309
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,990
what your laws are locally and if your

310
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:46,970
local laws say don't do it don't do it

311
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:49,210
it's not worth going to jail for also

312
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,620
I've seen a bunch of them that honestly

313
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:56,750
III think this needs to show up in a

314
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,760
sci-fi movie again you can see the

315
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,400
zig-zag pattern you can see the

316
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,350
development from that early stage and

317
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,210
that's one of the read that that's one

318
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,320
of the reasons why I like watching with

319
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,720
the 3d printed gun world is you get to

320
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,799
see all of this development from people

321
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,720
that just like in every other industry

322
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,120
now that we've got it so that an

323
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,850
individual at home can start tinkering

324
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,209
you can see all sorts of new neat

325
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,418
designs coming out that a major

326
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,860
manufacturer probably wouldn't play with

327
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,700
just because well I can see a lot of

328
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,770
people in the gun

329
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:40,940
industry just going no that that looks

330
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:48,970
dumb and stupid and to outside the norm

331
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:54,470
but I I think it looks really neat and

332
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:57,320
this is someone in Canada built one

333
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:02,600
based on the Liberator and you can see

334
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,040
the plastic springs up top and Canada is

335
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,010
kind of interesting because while they

336
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,190
in general have stricter gun laws than

337
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:13,550
we do they don't care about

338
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,050
short-barreled rifles if you can legally

339
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:19,190
own a rifle you can legally own a

340
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:21,950
short-barreled rifle which is an

341
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,710
argument we can have later I think that

342
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:29,720
part of the nFA's

343
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:35,150
I understand some of the context back in

344
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,730
the background of it but but any at any

345
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,250
rate I thought it was pretty neat that

346
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,300
that somebody took took the Liberator

347
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:49,180
pistol it made us look and feel a bit

348
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:54,110
better than that first clunky version

349
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:58,400
and folks have also built some other

350
00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:00,429
neat one-shot guns which this one's

351
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,760
pretty interesting because the barrel is

352
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:07,580
actually that blue spot there and to

353
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,240
load it and unload it you can just push

354
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:14,060
the barrel out of the side and this

355
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,890
particular example is a 22 but someone

356
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:25,129
has used this design to build a and fire

357
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:28,270
a 357 magnum I will say that he did have

358
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:33,200
to reinforce part of it with a zip tie

359
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:34,760
which braver man than I am because if

360
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,450
you were telling me yes I'm going to

361
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,710
need to worry about reinforcing

362
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,390
something using a plastic zip tie and

363
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,820
we're talking about a small explosion in

364
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,550
your

365
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,710
and those rubber bands on the trigger

366
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,909
bottom of the trigger and on the back of

367
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:57,660
the slide yes that is in lieu of a

368
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:00,270
hammer spring he used this design uses

369
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,450
rubber bands for the tension for the

370
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,450
hammer

371
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:09,840
exactly and that's and that's also part

372
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,060
of the problem is you know you keep down

373
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,399
to the materials like what are you gonna

374
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:19,169
do and this is it disassembled you can

375
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,560
see that he threw in a couple of washers

376
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:30,320
to stay legal but yeah you can see that

377
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:33,540
little hole right there where you could

378
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,750
poke a finger in to push the barrel out

379
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,200
the side so pull the barrel out extract

380
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,640
around put a new round in put it in

381
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,290
incidentally where I was talking about

382
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,800
with a 357 Magnum

383
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:50,970
where he needed to reinforce it was

384
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,500
right near the muzzle that part right

385
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,310
there was apparently seeing a good bit

386
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,230
of stress and it was delaminating but

387
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,770
does it put it to get kept it together

388
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,770
so

389
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,699
[Music]

390
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,470
yeah sure it I'm sure it's been tried

391
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:15,860
and and there's been a number of folks

392
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,550
that have made 3d printed guns where

393
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:23,709
they where they have used a metal tube

394
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:28,550
as as the actual barrel or you know or

395
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,280
put in a sleeve of some sort and of

396
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,950
course beyond the trying to build the

397
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,310
entire thing from the ground up as a 3d

398
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,580
printing gun a lot of folks are doing 3d

399
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:44,000
printed receivers so quick note if

400
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:48,439
you're not up on legalities with

401
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,340
firearms in the United States the only

402
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:57,430
part that is legally controlled is the

403
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:00,649
receiver which is in general where the

404
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:04,340
trigger group is housed and the barrel

405
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:09,770
attaches the vault and all that that in

406
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:12,320
general so if you can 3d print that you

407
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:16,070
can buy all the other pieces the barrel

408
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:21,290
vault the trigger all the springs those

409
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:24,470
are all legally in accessories so once

410
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:29,149
once you can build and this is just a 3d

411
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:33,650
printed 1022 receiver so this is the

412
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:36,020
original 1022 receiver that is here is a

413
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:42,460
serialized part is controlled part and

414
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:47,889
then this is the plastic 3d printed one

415
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:54,500
and in fact many people have 3d printed

416
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:57,010
ar-15 lowers lower receivers and this I

417
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,210
is a CAD representation you can see that

418
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:03,320
what they do is they they print it out

419
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:08,870
in parts and then hold them together the

420
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:12,139
ar-15 actually goes pretty well for that

421
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,760
because the lower receiver really

422
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,220
there's not a whole lot of high pressure

423
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,700
stuff

424
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,789
going on in below or receiver of an AR

425
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,559
so I've actually there's actually been a

426
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:25,950
couple folks that have made a our

427
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,299
receivers out of plywood and some bolts

428
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,850
just okay and of course if you're doing

429
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:38,610
3d printed stuff you can have fun with

430
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:46,289
it you can make some you can do designs

431
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:50,399
that are just goofy and similarly you

432
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:55,580
can play with things that this is an

433
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,760
ar-15 with a 3d print lower that is

434
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,070
clearly not anything near stock yes sir

435
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,629
I'm just gonna say you can buy those

436
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:07,860
lower receivers 80% finish yes sir and

437
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,659
they have no serial number on them

438
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,439
mm-hmm and these days when they sell

439
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:17,520
them they sell them with a plastic mold

440
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,710
that has all of the holes preset where

441
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,918
you can drill out the holes that need to

442
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,320
be done to finish them and they sell it

443
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,270
with the necessary drill bits and the

444
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,360
one milling tool that you get wired in

445
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,190
so it's really a kit yeah I've actually

446
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,110
got a picture of one of those later and

447
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,940
it takes about 20 minutes to yeah well

448
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,110
it's a lot quicker than 3d printer oh

449
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:43,740
yeah yeah and just in case if anybody's

450
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:47,490
interested there's a graphics

451
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:50,460
representation of the various parts and

452
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,770
as you said you know obviously that's

453
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,130
going to take a while to print out all

454
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,990
of those bits but it means you can play

455
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:03,020
with it come up with some new

456
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:06,030
interesting ideas and rapid prototype it

457
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:10,950
or you can just go completely gonzo with

458
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:15,600
it this is actually a 3d printed rail

459
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:18,809
gun that is functional it also weighs

460
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,649
about 20 pounds real dumb

461
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,649
real good

462
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:32,340
it actually throws out the projectile

463
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:37,939
using magnets uses about 1800 joules of

464
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:42,540
energy which sounds like a lot but

465
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:45,620
unfortunately folks have keep playing

466
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:51,420
with rail guns try to see if it works

467
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:54,530
but that will at that power the guy

468
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,850
tested it and it would put a projectile

469
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:01,790
into a cantaloupe but up through it

470
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:05,120
which yeah it's what range that still

471
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:09,149
and I wouldn't want to get hit by it but

472
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,179
also for you know carrying 20 pounds of

473
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:24,660
stuff I'd want something a little bit

474
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:30,170
more powerful oh yeah absolutely again I

475
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:33,510
want to see this in a sci-fi movie and

476
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:42,000
finally for the 3d printed gun side of

477
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:44,879
things this is the future this is a 1911

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,320
that has been 3d printed everything

479
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:54,360
except for the springs and the magazines

480
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:57,899
a company I believe down in Texas did it

481
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,439
as a proof-of-concept saying that hey

482
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:07,110
our metal 3d printers do actually print

483
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:10,380
things that are rugged and strong they

484
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:15,209
made this guy ran it through 5,000

485
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:17,310
rounds without any failures which I can

486
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,500
think of a couple commercial 19:11

487
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:26,918
Brants that can't say the same thing

488
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:32,380
pretty dismal like um I believe it's

489
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:46,030
actually a powder base yeah it is so

490
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:47,470
it's not a CNC machine no there there

491
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,129
there have been people that have been

492
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:54,370
using CNC machines for a long time a lot

493
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,710
a lot of the a lot of the commercial

494
00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:02,049
companies you've CNC machines for parts

495
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:04,929
yeah and just about all that's one of

496
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:10,240
the major forms of manufacturing at this

497
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:12,429
point right and you know the big reason

498
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,309
why I'm just not that concerned about I

499
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:20,740
don't understand the panic over 3d

500
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:24,250
printed guns is because well did it go

501
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,900
there's that yeah it's up good no and

502
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:30,520
this one the guy got fancy and put a

503
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:35,100
silencer on it clearly this is some

504
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:39,580
brass fittings with a spring and a nail

505
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:41,918
a a little bit of drill work that if

506
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:51,399
you're vaguely capable in a shop you can

507
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:54,780
do exactly and this one you can see the

508
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,919
guy was using uh leave that's a 22 short

509
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:00,700
subsonic or there might be so Thank You

510
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,220
sunshine well it's yeah oh yeah that's

511
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,580
that's epsilon sonic um I'm trying to I

512
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,570
I think that might actually that's why

513
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,210
the suppressor works yeah

514
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:18,450
as oppressors that's that's an entire

515
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,860
different grant mine and of course you

516
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,660
get people to get a little bit fancier

517
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,260
and put a grip on it to make a little

518
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,900
bit more we're gonna humming again this

519
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,670
is something that most folks in middle

520
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,300
school shop class would be able to

521
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,300
ensure now

522
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,740
yeah yeah from the 50s when car in

523
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,780
Canada tenants were a little bit

524
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,610
telescoping and yep you just break them

525
00:31:52,780 --> 00:32:00,760
on and one of the segments would be just

526
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:03,399
the right size for 20 exactly and it's

527
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,670
not just in this country this this is a

528
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:11,470
zip gun that was found in India where

529
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:14,170
guns are highly regulated again pretty

530
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,200
much straight up banned unless if you're

531
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,360
part of the government and this

532
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,960
particular one that was confiscated you

533
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,490
can see the guy had actually found the

534
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,930
right pipe fittings for multiple

535
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:31,660
calibers looks like a 22 maybe a

536
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:37,660
nine-millimeter and then a 12-gauge

537
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:41,290
shell exactly yeah because India also

538
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:48,880
has you can get in deep deep trouble

539
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:51,280
just tapping the ammunition on you this

540
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,840
is one my favorite ones this is actually

541
00:32:51,280 --> 00:33:00,700
a shotgun made out of a caulk gun you

542
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:05,740
can see it right here with the the

543
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,580
trigger and spring you can also make

544
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,580
them out of stable guns

545
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:23,610
that's cool

546
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:28,110
and anybody know what this is it's an

547
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:34,049
ak-47 receiver just it hasn't been

548
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:36,360
stamped yet so as long as you know you

549
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:39,299
get this flat sheet of metal make the

550
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:44,309
correct holes in it fold it like a taco

551
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:46,020
and bear legally is you're a k47

552
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:49,730
receiver which is the gun and you can

553
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:52,139
get the rest of the stuff legally and

554
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:56,400
there are a bunch of places that sell

555
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,820
these things and if you can't find one

556
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:05,429
for sale well this guy made one out of a

557
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:11,869
shovel he actually took the shovel blade

558
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:14,970
and made it into the ak-47 receiver and

559
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:18,240
decided for giggles I'll just use the

560
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:22,290
handle as the stock I particularly like

561
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:25,918
get balancing on the bottle of Stoli he

562
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:32,000
tested it and it didn't work I forget

563
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,000
exactly what he used for the barrel but

564
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:44,040
reading that guy's web web page he was a

565
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:47,520
bit of a character and of course

566
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,989
you can also make a machine gun from

567
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,980
stuff that you can easily find at Home

568
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:59,189
Depot this is a gun that basically works

569
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:02,960
like a Sten gun which again is basically

570
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:09,170
a tube in a spring and the firing pin

571
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:11,130
there's not a whole lot to it there are

572
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,810
instructions on how to do it on the

573
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,740
Internet

574
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,360
that's all I'm gonna tell you about that

575
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,000
if you want if you want to find the

576
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,930
machine the way to make machine gun you

577
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,930
can find it on Google

578
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:31,230
this one is full auto the guy that

579
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,020
posted it swears up and down that

580
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:42,900
there's not a firing pin in it

581
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:48,930
therefore it's legal yeah no I'm on all

582
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:51,030
the lists at this point the and part of

583
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,680
that is it is actually easier to

584
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,370
manufacture machine gun than it is to

585
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,370
make a semi-auto

586
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,779
because basically the difference between

587
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,560
a machine gun and a semi-auto is a

588
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,520
semi-auto has a seer in it that or a

589
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,350
trigger disconnect so that when you pull

590
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,320
the trigger

591
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:14,640
it fires and when it comes back

592
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,890
something catches the hammer to stop the

593
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,359
hammer from falling again and if not it

594
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,990
would prefer to just keep going

595
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,990
exactly

596
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:28,828
and there it is in disassembled State

597
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:29,910
I'm sure if you stare at it that long

598
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:34,010
enough you could probably figure out

599
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,009
which aisles at Home Depot to go down

600
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:44,940
and there is a much closer replica of a

601
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,390
Sten gun again made out of parts that

602
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:56,819
you can find at Home Depot or Lowe's

603
00:36:47,390 --> 00:37:02,040
wherever here is a mac-11 clone built

604
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:04,460
out of box tubes but again you can buy a

605
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,410
guerrilla hardware store

606
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:13,250
most the time folks do use commercial

607
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,990
pre-built magazines because oddly enough

608
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,950
out of everything

609
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,970
magazines are probably the hardest thing

610
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,890
to build and get right because there's a

611
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,480
lot of geometry that has to be exactly

612
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:29,009
right and spring tension that has to be

613
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:33,540
exactly right and all that fun stuff as

614
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:35,160
you were talking about is amazing yes as

615
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:40,920
you were talking about there's always

616
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:45,210
the 80% lowers which when I originally

617
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,950
put this slide show together a ar-15s

618
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,650
were pretty much what you would find

619
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,250
where the does anyone not know what I'm

620
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:57,329
talking about with it with an 80% lower

621
00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:00,660
okay so basically there's the question

622
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:04,549
of where's the difference between I have

623
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:07,920
a chunk of aluminum and I have a

624
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:10,880
receiver that now I need to make sure

625
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,760
that the ATF knows about etcetera etc

626
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,549
and

627
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,410
[Music]

628
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:20,049
while it's never been quite exactly

629
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:23,649
stated the ATF and the community have

630
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:26,259
kind of come across kind of come to the

631
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:31,029
conclusion that well if it's 80% done

632
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:33,069
whatever that exactly means then then

633
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,869
it's still just an oddly-shaped chunk of

634
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:38,200
material instead of a gun

635
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:42,309
all right so to complete this you'd

636
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,368
still have to drill out the holes here

637
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:49,559
some of the holes here there's some

638
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:53,710
places for pins that you'd have to drill

639
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:55,710
which this red thing is a jig that you

640
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,640
slap it on and it guides you through

641
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:02,920
here's where you drill and since then

642
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,740
there's also been folks have come out

643
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:11,109
with 80% low 80% receivers for Glock

644
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:17,109
pistols in case you want to build your

645
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:24,819
own pocket home and and all that fun

646
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:29,470
stuff and also we were talking about CNC

647
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:31,410
machines earlier distributed defense

648
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:36,118
cells what they call the DOS gunner

649
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:39,730
which is a CNC machine about me a big

650
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:44,140
which you can get pre-programmed files

651
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:47,519
for okay I've got it an AR lower that's

652
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,109
an 80% lower I can put that in there

653
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,598
load up the correct program hit the

654
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:55,328
button and the CNC machine will take

655
00:39:52,599 --> 00:40:00,000
care of actually producing it for you

656
00:39:55,329 --> 00:40:05,440
interestingly enough the ATF for years

657
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:11,680
has been telling people that if you own

658
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:14,019
the equipment you can't rent it out so

659
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,770
that somebody just comes by gives you

660
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:20,828
some money it's the big red button

661
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:23,859
that's the ATF was not considering that

662
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:26,109
as then manufacturing it but you

663
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:30,130
manufacturing it because you owned the

664
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:33,520
equipment and did most of the work in

665
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:37,020
practice recently the one guy that

666
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:42,630
they've gone after for doing just that

667
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:47,280
they recently dropped the case and

668
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,280
decided that they'd rather not prosecute

669
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:56,319
so it very well may be and the ATF has

670
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:58,930
done this in the past where they tried

671
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,029
it well we really don't have legal

672
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:04,118
standing but this is the way we think

673
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,780
it's supposed to go and so we'll just

674
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,750
see if we can just bully people into

675
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,690
pleading a lesser charge or whatever and

676
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,250
this particular guide was willing and

677
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:19,630
had the pocket-book

678
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:22,510
to fight it for a couple years and it

679
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:26,310
still hadn't seen the inside it still

680
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:29,980
hadn't got in front of a jury yet and

681
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:35,799
the ATF decided to drop it what that

682
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:38,440
exactly means I'm not entirely certain

683
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,200
but if you want if you want to buy one

684
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,630
of these you can't get a CNC machine

685
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,399
from them and you can incidentally you

686
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:48,460
can put whatever program you want so you

687
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,440
have a small CNC machine he'll do just

688
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,440
about anything today that you would

689
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,589
expect it to be able to for a couple

690
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,010
grand from them which compared to the

691
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:03,450
commercial ones that's pretty cheap

692
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,450
that's that's getting down into

693
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:11,368
fairly reasonable and affordable last I

694
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:14,308
knew it was about 16 yeah it was like

695
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:16,559
1,500 to 2,000 depending on they just

696
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:18,990
came out with a new version of it and I

697
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:23,369
can't remember the original approach was

698
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:26,220
1200 when they came up to that had the

699
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:31,950
ability to load the additional profiles

700
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,598
and yeah and that first one was I saw

701
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:38,339
the preorder price I never saw it the

702
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:42,059
actual sales price so by the way if

703
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:45,390
anybody's interested these three sites

704
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,619
homemade guns don't wordpress.com is

705
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:54,210
where I found most of the zip gun

706
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:57,869
pictures death disk or gas ports defense

707
00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:03,770
distributed and also printed firearms

708
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:07,910
comm is pretty good resource as well and

709
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:11,009
like I said also code is free speech is

710
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:14,160
where some of it a bunch of it migrated

711
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:17,250
to and right now you can find some

712
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:22,319
pretty good info on the ongoing court

713
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:24,359
cases there so that's here I know I

714
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,609
rushed through things a good bit because

715
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:29,359
I always tend to talk too long and this

716
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:32,960
time I've actually got a few minutes

717
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,960
anybody have any questions

718
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,390
you

719
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,849
[Applause]
