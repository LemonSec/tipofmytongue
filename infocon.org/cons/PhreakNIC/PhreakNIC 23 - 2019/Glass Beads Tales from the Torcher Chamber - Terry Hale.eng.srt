1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,450
I'm going to go through this fairly

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,890
quickly I have a video as well and it

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,929
was supposed to be part of the slideshow

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,459
but for summer in the PowerPoint didn't

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,170
like my video it won't go in the right

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,429
place because I'm going to try to breeze

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,560
through this and then I'll just start

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,810
the video and you guys can come up and

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,779
take a look at things and touch things

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,180
and ask questions then is that okay cuz

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,590
videos a little bit too long to show the

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,890
whole thing but you can watch it in the

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,080
pocket all that at the end so call it

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,840
tales from the torture chamber because I

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,309
sit in a torch all day and I'll show you

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,380
pictures and once the torches are like

17
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,910
and how we do it we're gonna go into

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,649
open a glass history here actually very

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,809
little is known about the origins of the

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,350
last sort of a mystery that that showed

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,480
up over a few centuries the first hints

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,750
about it are from about 4000 years ago

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,419
in Mesopotamia I think it was inspired

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,989
by like working with ceramics and

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,420
pottery metalwork and probably by

26
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,689
accident one group seemed to think that

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,400
it came from cooking on the beach the

28
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,589
Phoenician sailors would would stop at

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,540
the beach and cook and use pottery and

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,040
then it would melt the sand underneath

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,590
but that's been debunked because it

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,909
doesn't get hot enough to melt the sand

33
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,590
but they actually think it kind of

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:28,500
developed organically like in different

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,659
places you know it a little bit of time

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,310
and they started sharing the place oh we

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,290
found out it does this if you add this

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,240
to it you get color and again this to it

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,710
it's stronger and it just kind of grew

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,658
it developed as a unique substance

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,889
nobody had seen anything quite like this

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,560
and the pottery was kind of dirty

43
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,190
didn't have quite the same chemical

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,780
makeup what was really exciting was when

45
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,690
they discovered you could add the

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,850
medical excusing metal oxides to create

47
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,120
the colors and the two most favorite

48
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,860
ones were blues they're still struggling

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,470
to find a purple for us even to today

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,800
that's a good purple but using cobalt

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,940
oxide and copper oxide you can get these

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,560
kind of colors that of course these

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,820
aren't old pieces here but I just want

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,240
to show you the two colors and what

55
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,160
we're talking about and then um one

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,500
thing they try to do is imitate natural

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,810
stones and precious stones lapis was

58
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,270
really really of a sought-after stone as

59
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,570
was turquoise so all of a sudden the

60
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,720
artists and the palaces and all could

61
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:36,070
have those colors without the cost of

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,580
actually having to get the stone now

63
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:44,000
early controlled blast work was done

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,310
over an alcohol lamp and today you'll

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,250
even hear what I do refer to as lamp

66
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,980
work lampwork glass beads and we used

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,200
lamp in a long long time I use the

68
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,420
special torch it's an oxygen propane

69
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,950
surface mixed torch I'll have a picture

70
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,570
of it in a minute here so I'll show you

71
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,910
believe it or not there are dozens and

72
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,340
dozens and dozens of different specially

73
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,180
made glass bead torches it's that big an

74
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,209
industry ok this was just for fun I

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,820
found this online and it's an early

76
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,110
glass recipe and the reason I have a

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,280
pinterest thing up there is because it

78
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,870
reminded me of pinterest you know when

79
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,349
you find a recipe but you have to read

80
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,480
about what their dog did that morning

81
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,249
what was doing six years ago but how

82
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,950
they feel and stuff in the recipes like

83
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:29,540
roll and yes girl that's kind of how

84
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,730
this was because over here the first

85
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,499
part was when you said upon the

86
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,179
foundation of kiln to make glass you

87
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:37,819
first search in a favorable month for a

88
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,859
prophetess day and only then settle the

89
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,750
foundation of the kiln and then he goes

90
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,609
here about you you regularly perform

91
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,290
libation offerings before the Cova

92
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,239
images and on the day when you plan to

93
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:53,168
place the glass and the kiln you make a

94
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:56,000
sheep sacrifice and I felt that part out

95
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,290
over here's the actual recipe and a lot

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,099
of this over here I'm not going to go

97
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,578
into it's the same thing we used today

98
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,530
sand certain types of ash different

99
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,449
oxides and this goes into how you get

100
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,430
the fire to go and everything that's I

101
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,099
buy mine there are people who actually

102
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:18,048
still make their own glass but that's

103
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:20,478
I'm not patient enough for that okay a

104
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:24,229
quick story of how we got to where we

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,659
are today about two thousand years ago

106
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:32,240
glass making made its played in Europe

107
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:33,409
and it ended up mainly in Italy for a

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,300
couple of reasons there was a high

109
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:37,849
concentration of people who landed there

110
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,550
because it was an island and secondly

111
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:42,979
they could put these huge glass making

112
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,630
places in the middle of the water on an

113
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,940
island so it didn't burn down a city

114
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,060
that was a real problem still is

115
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,780
everyone's gonna have a big fire but in

116
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,210
the 1600s Venice became a

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,239
major glass capital they supplied the

118
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,359
whole world and there were so secretive

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,040
of what they did the the workers there

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,080
were under the threat of either

121
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,720
dismemberment or death if they shared

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,460
any of their secrets okay that's a

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,010
pretty good reason not to however

124
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,469
eventually some of the people escaped

125
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,830
there and went north as far as Germany

126
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,750
they ended up in Laos shut Germany is a

127
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,240
capital where they make a lot of glass

128
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,240
German ornaments and these people found

129
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,400
work which energized the German glass

130
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,020
industry and Malaysia is now a major

131
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,849
capital so um in 1800s Native Americans

132
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,890
were traded for glass beads for the

133
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,640
European settlers that was a big change

134
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:48,340
over in the 50s and 60s in the United

135
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,440
States the studio glass movement started

136
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,109
and by studio glass I mean people who

137
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,570
have studio at home and a burner and

138
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,690
they got glass and they melted it now

139
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,370
nobody really knew what they were doing

140
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,719
but everybody was trying and there

141
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,640
wasn't the communication that we have

142
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,800
now so people were like in their little

143
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,789
cocoon they're melting and learning and

144
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,660
coming up with tools and eventually some

145
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:16,450
of them came up with some pretty good

146
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:18,730
ways to do things however in the 1980s

147
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,349
the Society of glass bead makers was

148
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,480
formed which is now the International

149
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,660
Society of glass bead bankers which was

150
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,190
started as an American group who know

151
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,420
people in the West Coast did this that

152
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,650
they got together and started sharing

153
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,240
ideas techniques tools they come up with

154
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,739
some of we're building our torches and

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,229
they shared ideas on that

156
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,880
like PC work now you know people talk

157
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:43,539
about how they build pcs and different

158
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,940
things they can do in the 1990s

159
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,940
god bless the internet that caused a

160
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,910
huge boom because all the stuff that had

161
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:55,300
been secret and then hard to disperse it

162
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,970
the internet everybody willing to make

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,229
glass beads it seems like a lot of

164
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,550
people think probably not to you there's

165
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,639
probably about three or four thousand of

166
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,550
us in the world but this gave an

167
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,680
opportunity to share ideas and to say oh

168
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,349
if you put this glass with this oxide

169
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,300
with this glass that has this metal in

170
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,919
it you can melt them together you get a

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,280
new color in between them or a new

172
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,250
reaction or it looks you'll get a new

173
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,448
green instead of the pink and the green

174
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,000
that you put together you may get a

175
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,770
totally different kind of green and just

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,810
as an aside here when I'm talking about

177
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,849
it when you put glass together he

178
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,430
doesn't mix like paint red and blue do

179
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,050
not make purple because of the medes

180
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,630
they'll react to one another and get

181
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,219
some other odd color based on whatever

182
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:46,930
they've gotten those two colors later on

183
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:49,090
Europe and the Asian countries got

184
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,159
involved in glass bead banking and now

185
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,729
it's a worldwide industry Russia is

186
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,009
really big Germany the United States is

187
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,719
kind of floundering a little bit we kind

188
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,120
of had so many people doing it for a

189
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,070
while that it was hard to sell your work

190
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,330
so a lot of people are hanging up there

191
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,520
towards you going on to do something

192
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,940
else but yeah it for me I'm sticking

193
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,940
with it

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,250
okay today we have national and

195
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,560
international conventions several online

196
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,139
groups from Facebook Instagram lots of

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,939
other places regional retreats I hope

198
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,979
co-host to retreat twice a year in

199
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,780
Asheville North Carolina we have 30

200
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,430
different artists and show up from all

201
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,939
over the country plus a couple from

202
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,990
Europe three days of just making glass

203
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,510
and having fun

204
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,579
there are several glass and tulle

205
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,338
suppliers this is probably one person's

206
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:44,410
rack of glass right here that looks like

207
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,850
heaven to me

208
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,780
and then there dozens of specialty

209
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,550
torches for beat work and guys if you

210
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,020
have any questions to holler man I'm

211
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,199
trying to bus do this so I can get to

212
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,079
the video okay so how far we've come I

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,200
want to show you some of the things that

214
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,630
people are making now glass these are

215
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,700
some other artists I really admire Brant

216
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,160
Pierce and I'm takes a personal friend

217
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:15,670
of mine does these beautiful pieces

218
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,670
they're huge this is a marble

219
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,019
and this is a friend barbell she does a

220
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,399
lot of sculptural pieces now the glass

221
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,529
that we use and I'll talk about that in

222
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,600
a few minutes does not make for doing

223
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,689
this it's soft glass it's made for

224
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,709
making round beads so pushing the

225
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:37,469
envelope ashtray bride down was a South

226
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,660
African artist and she uses enamels on

227
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,309
her beads and I still don't know how she

228
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,419
does this I've seen her doing us still

229
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,480
don't know how she makes them work like

230
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,949
this

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,290
this is a Lee Van de Graaff she's in the

232
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,089
Pacific Northwest she was 20 years old

233
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,730
she is such one where to blow glass she

234
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:56,040
made scientific glass in college ended

235
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,160
up working for Oakbridge laboratories to

236
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,929
a specialty scientific glass and she

237
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,299
start making these beads and that's um

238
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:08,790
that beat is probably the speaker she

239
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,108
uses probably I think it's four rods of

240
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,959
glass which I'll show up here to make

241
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:15,239
the base and it does the decoration the

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,919
drawings on there are thin hair thin

243
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,049
pieces of glass that she draws with

244
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,639
which is very very difficult because it

245
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,139
melts as fast as she put it on so you

246
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,519
have to get just at the right speed and

247
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,649
you draw with both hands basically

248
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,939
you're drawing with the base band with

249
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:29,819
the springer to get it to where you want

250
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:31,469
it to go the glass she used on this

251
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,209
particular one is one that's impregnated

252
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,199
was silver so it's got that nice shiny

253
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,998
surface to it and this is Holly Cooper I

254
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:43,079
just had a class with her not too long

255
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:44,339
back she uses a lot of enamels and does

256
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,199
a lot of stringer work there that's

257
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,870
three views of the same vein she likes

258
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,699
to make

259
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,440
cuz of Phoenician things and just to go

260
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,200
backwards just a bit this is where we

261
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,040
came from these are some early beads

262
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,600
here and then these are some Marini

263
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,520
beads which we'll talk about just a

264
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,410
moment slices of glass that's been put

265
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,060
together but you see how far the

266
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:15,069
techniques have come and how clean the

267
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:16,510
work is okay the types of glass this is

268
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,190
one of mine right here this is actually

269
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,960
a sculpture it's a little Christmas tree

270
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,000
stand and then crystal the Christmas

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:27,370
fish on top it was a special order there

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,630
are basically two kinds of glass that

273
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,680
are used to make beads either

274
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,780
borosilicate or soda lime glass

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,370
borosilicate is on some of you may be

276
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,020
old enough to remember going to a fair

277
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,540
or a mall and seeing people making

278
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,560
little animals at a clear glass and they

279
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,599
would lay them on the counter little

280
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,010
cool off for me to buy them that's a

281
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,590
totally different glass in what I use

282
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,439
that is similar to what your pirates

283
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,830
dishes used to be made out of and it's

284
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,320
got a different coefficient of expansion

285
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,970
than the soda lime glass which just

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
means it's a number of side of the glass

287
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,340
that tells you how much the glass

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,160
shrinks as it cools off and your glass

289
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,240
you can't mix two different cos because

290
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,040
you get stress in the glass speed break

291
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,730
soda lime is the traditional venetian

292
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,139
round bead glass against usually

293
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,889
for round beads it's manufactured Italy

294
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:25,170
Germany China Czech Republic India and

295
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,540
the United States all have different

296
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,589
companies that makes the glass

297
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,180
interesting that there used to be a

298
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:33,180
Chinese company that make glass it was

299
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,519
really horrible a woman from Canada

300
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,469
started a company she bought one of the

301
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,660
horrible companies in China she runs it

302
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,370
like a Western company they have now

303
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,680
have some of the finest glass you can

304
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,570
find and she's very very good to her

305
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,069
workers too so we like to support them

306
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:52,620
but their glass is really expensive

307
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,260
the glass they use begins to move in the

308
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,180
torch around a thousand degrees becomes

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,829
molten around twelve or fourteen hundred

310
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,739
depending on what's in the glass what

311
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:05,010
kind of metals or whatever they use and

312
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,199
my torch goes up around to 2,000 degrees

313
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,529
I hardly ever use it that hot listen I

314
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,800
am might need some borosilicate work the

315
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,899
glass can be transparent we can see

316
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,000
through it clear or you know a color

317
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,370
that you can see through it can be

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,630
opaque which in the glass world is

319
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,890
called the pest

320
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,310
and you'll be corrected by the

321
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,420
old-school people who can call it opaque

322
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,010
striking which means it starts out as

323
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,140
one color but when heated in the flame

324
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,330
and let it cool and then heat it again

325
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,670
and pick it out of the flame it turns

326
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:40,140
bright red or bright orange or bright

327
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,030
yellow those are fun and then the oxides

328
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,880
and the Oh pacifiers then put in the

329
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,850
glass make every single color feel

330
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,320
different in the flame white glass when

331
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,330
you put it in the flame we call it baby

332
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,340
snot because as soon as it gets hot it

333
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,140
just drips everywhere you have to really

334
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,480
learn to work with it and if I get the

335
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,370
video to work I'll be making a fish you

336
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,630
can see some of the the white glass it

337
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,220
turns absolutely clear while you're

338
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,189
working with it if there's cools off it

339
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,380
turns white again some of the stiffer

340
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,270
glasses like I think there's some cobalt

341
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,950
blue going around this transparent that

342
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,350
stuff is horrible to melt because it's

343
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,870
just so sticky there's so much stuff in

344
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,910
it to make it that deep rich blue that

345
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,020
you can hardly get it to melt and you

346
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,510
have to be careful with the different

347
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,270
colors because some colors do burn

348
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,170
yellows will bubble Reds will get what

349
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,420
we call liver spots on its

350
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,979
it's a constant learning curve every

351
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,329
time to pick up glass and you color you

352
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,889
have to play with it see what it does

353
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,929
and then if you're going to put it with

354
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,209
another glass to make a decoration on it

355
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,470
you may have to char the two together to

356
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,469
make sure that they will work together

357
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:50,299
they have today as doing some basic

358
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:52,399
glass work to be specialized specialized

359
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,899
shapes of the tube right right that's

360
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,029
how that Brad Pearson who made the big

361
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,649
marble he got his start we have a lot of

362
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,439
folks who started in scientific glass

363
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,119
they've moved over to the art world I

364
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:06,849
guess they were making too much money in

365
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:06,850
the oh yes

366
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:23,630
availability of soda lime glass and I

367
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:26,330
understand yeah what is that like

368
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:30,110
nowadays like is this available if you

369
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,000
want yeah yeah they're the company I get

370
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,280
most of my my glass from is Mountain

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,260
glass arts in North Carolina and they

372
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,480
specialize in borosilicate glass they

373
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,880
get a lot of sign backs that's the more

374
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:46,130
expensive the they have some Chinese

375
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
borosilicate clear I mean you know

376
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,630
usually you're gonna do something simple

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,800
with that I'm not sure where the color

378
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,260
borosilicate comes from it has always

379
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,339
been very expensive and very fickle you

380
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,510
don't know what color you're really

381
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,320
going to get till it comes out of the

382
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:03,140
kiln so but yeah it was a big problem

383
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,850
when the borosilicate market drawer the

384
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,850
supplier dried up from

385
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:18,779
okay we talked about the torches this is

386
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,210
the Nortel minor burner this is like the

387
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,850
toyota corolla of vice big making

388
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:26,100
torches it's not fast it's not hot it's

389
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,750
not sexy but it'll run every time you

390
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,890
turn it on and it melts beautifully how

391
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,360
many of these will yelling probably

392
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,770
fifteen or sixteen of them because I

393
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,960
teach classes and I take them through

394
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,460
the classes and you throw them in a box

395
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,860
and you take them to the next class you

396
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,710
take about a climate of a stable a table

397
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,960
hook up to the hoses of oxygen and

398
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,170
propane and they fire right up so

399
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,730
they're great little torches this is

400
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,199
called the cricket I think this is cute

401
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,180
I always think of men in black with a

402
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,680
little gun the cricket that's what it

403
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,630
reminds me I agree this is the Bethlehem

404
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,089
champion and you can see it's got two

405
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,819
hosts is the two red are for the propane

406
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,069
and the two green and for oxygen that

407
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:12,420
just gives you more oomph you can build

408
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:14,639
bigger stuff and as the torches get

409
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,480
bigger we refer to them as compensation

410
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,480
torches

411
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,980
this is a barracuda not many people need

412
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,359
this much firepower but people buy them

413
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,910
this torch right here the one that I

414
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:36,379
took the the first one the miner is

415
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:38,540
about $200 and this was about 1,500 the

416
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,510
Bethlehem stacks which is interesting if

417
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,790
he notice it's actually two torches yeah

418
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,070
it's got the the big one for actually

419
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,960
melting the glass and then the tiny went

420
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,120
up there for doing detail work that's

421
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,140
somebody doing this kind of stuff

422
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,719
couldn't do what I do because they'd

423
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,220
have too much fire going I actually work

424
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,580
with real tiny flame and I like to work

425
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,170
slowly and then you get to the mega

426
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,460
miner this looks like it's gonna take

427
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:06,140
over the world and these are interesting

428
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,580
I threw this in because the Japanese

429
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,980
have the kind of glass it's a totally

430
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,530
different CoA than anybody else it's got

431
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,040
a very high co e so it stays malleable

432
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,600
for a long time it's so soft when you

433
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,879
melt it that you could basically hold it

434
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,439
over a candle and it will start to move

435
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,480
it won't melt completely but it will

436
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,670
actually move it we're talking two rods

437
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,270
like they're going around there so they

438
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:32,300
use what's called a volcano torch the

439
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,100
flame comes straight up but you notice

440
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,680
there's no place for oxygen right here's

441
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,110
a little nozzle and what they do is it a

442
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,299
bit aquarium pump to it

443
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,360
and that just keeps the flame going

444
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,370
straight when I work with my flame and

445
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,199
you'll see if I get the video going but

446
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,029
I light it up I turn it on and it's just

447
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,679
a messy propane flame and it's going

448
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,539
everywhere it won't melt the glass it'll

449
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,970
just get it all sitting and make it warm

450
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,830
but when I had oxygen to it it cleans up

451
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,450
the flame and makes it earned very very

452
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:04,059
straight clean and it'll take all the

453
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:07,990
slip right off the glass there's my baby

454
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:10,029
the Bethlehem alpha I love this torch I

455
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,309
can with this particular one I can have

456
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,049
the flame up big and I can do what

457
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,879
horses look at icicles and things like

458
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,710
that or I could turn it down and do what

459
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,289
I liked it was very very tiny detail

460
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,120
work like I've got some little tiny dots

461
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,010
up here and I've got a seashell it's got

462
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,149
a crab living inside of it I did him

463
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,149
with that little tiny flame

464
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,440
the basic tools that I use and I have

465
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,850
some of this up here the manuals people

466
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,310
say how do you get the hole in the glass

467
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,810
I kind of start with a hollow which is

468
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,810
the mandrel and put the glass arm out of

469
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:45,810
it these are stainless steel 316l

470
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,610
uncoated the welding rods stainless

471
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,679
steel like I said they're dipped in this

472
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,449
clay mixture which is like a clay slip

473
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,880
just a water you play make sure that's

474
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,230
got graphite in it the end of its dipped

475
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,430
and everybody always says putting out

476
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,640
those sparklers because that's exactly

477
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,590
what it looks like when it's sparklers

478
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:07,470
that dries and then you make the bead on

479
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,570
to where that clay slip is and then if I

480
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,150
need it right on the metal rod stick to

481
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,679
the metal and break this is a spray and

482
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:18,210
you're running Pam make your brownies

483
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,780
the glass rods which just went around

484
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,790
here and then the panel over there is

485
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,410
graphite but we're shaping and making

486
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,270
long skinny beads would roll the glass

487
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,400
you don't want a tool that's going to

488
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,050
suck the heat out of the glass if you

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,180
use brass it's going to cool it off too

490
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,090
fast and put stress in it

491
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,530
graphite tends to not soak up the heat

492
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,100
so quickly and you have little working

493
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,470
time and then on the end here these

494
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,439
glasses we call these birth control

495
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,090
glasses because nobody looks sexing up

496
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,220
they're actually a special coating is

497
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,649
called goddamn em and when you put the

498
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,170
tort by the glass into the flame there's

499
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,230
a sodium flare that is intense yellow

500
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,880
but hurt your eyes yellow it won't

501
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,650
damage your eyes like some of the

502
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,070
borosilicate can it's so bright you can

503
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,200
actually burn your retinas with the soda

504
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,970
lime glass it's more of a hindrance it's

505
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,770
so bright and some yellow that you can't

506
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,530
see what you're doing so when you put

507
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,330
these glasses on it's like magic

508
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,428
it's always funny to have visitors to

509
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,439
the studio it's like okay look at the

510
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,970
put on the glasses and be safe but

511
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,289
they're working and say that look over

512
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,820
your glasses and they raise it up and

513
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,250
everybody was good

514
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:29,299
Wow because it's just this intense

515
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:32,840
yellow there are better looking glasses

516
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,250
than that but not much I actually worked

517
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,649
with a little bit of borosilicate so I

518
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,840
have a flip-up shiny that's darker it's

519
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,340
not gonna be working on soft glass and

520
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,139
then decide to make some icicles out of

521
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:47,389
aura flip it down and I've come to

522
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:50,929
stronger protection some things that we

523
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,309
use frit is just round up glass glass

524
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,299
blowers glass it's very very

525
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,158
concentrated you can make your own but

526
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,740
there's a couple of companies that make

527
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,510
it this is Bell Cox's line she has lots

528
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,970
more than this where she's come up with

529
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:10,850
mixes of glass that complement one

530
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:14,480
another or do things in the flame people

531
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:19,928
we have posed a threat now they want to

532
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,929
come right up and go with their favor

533
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:30,650
telling them not to one of the coolest

534
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,520
things she was doing a demo one time in

535
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:37,780
Scottsboro and alchemy actually torches

536
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,700
out outside she has a shield up and

537
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,190
she's actually making the beads so

538
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,169
people can see it a couple little kids

539
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:50,450
come up what's the first thing I want to

540
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:56,860
do reach for the flame Terry when it

541
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:56,860
Kevin Linda muy caliente their eyes

542
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:10,920
basically speak Spanish you know huh

543
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,110
it's so cool not expecting Spanish we

544
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,150
talked about how what's in the glass

545
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,860
makes different things happen and I just

546
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,720
pulled out an example this this

547
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,429
particular it's called aqua violet and

548
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,440
that's just foul came up with a name for

549
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,330
that's what it looked like to her and

550
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,610
she made it on these different beads

551
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,080
those are all the same frit on different

552
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,370
face beads so what you do is you make

553
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,760
your bead and then you roll it in some

554
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:35,699
friend melted in easiest bead you can

555
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,020
make so it's just kind of interesting

556
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,850
that when you put it on different colors

557
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,860
it does different things and some of the

558
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:51,000
glass is really really drastic that what

559
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:53,639
he does sometimes and sometimes it

560
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,350
reacts horribly like ivory colored glass

561
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,720
if you put what's called a reactive

562
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,669
color when it turns to mud it just

563
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,860
doesn't look like anything sometimes you

564
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,160
get a whole new colors sometimes you get

565
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,600
there's a purple glass we have which I

566
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,320
said they're still trying to get a good

567
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:14,159
purple it's an opaque purple number 862

568
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,129
it's the number of it but we call it EDP

569
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,570
evil Deventer fine purple because when

570
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,909
you put it in the flaming and work it

571
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,470
causes crystal growth

572
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,600
like a white frost comes out on the

573
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,389
surface of glass and then you have to

574
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,158
reheat it make it go back in but you got

575
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,769
try to turn it and reheat everything

576
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,519
exactly the same amount and it's really

577
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:37,840
hard to do but yeah usually you try to

578
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,820
get something that either blends or

579
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,269
highly contrasting especially might need

580
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,428
eyes when you say it Alex when you

581
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:47,559
mention the ribs I figured that you'd

582
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:51,190
probably be watch a little sharp uh-huh

583
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:54,399
it's broken glass and it can be either

584
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,019
like almost like enamel or it can be

585
00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:00,610
great big chunks you can get it

586
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:02,529
different sizes okay

587
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,789
Morini this is one of my favorite things

588
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:06,820
to make and it's very very

589
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,629
time-consuming you can take your glass

590
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,668
and Bank

591
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:12,189
these are rods it's somewhat it's make

592
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,869
where they made it gather and glass

593
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,940
which is a blob of glass and they took

594
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:17,709
another broader glass and drew those

595
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,230
little curved lines with it real thick

596
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,409
and then they encased it meaning they

597
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,909
wrap glass around it and then they head

598
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:26,799
on a handle here and they took another

599
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:29,470
rod of glass and stuck it to it and they

600
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,759
turned it it might be this big and they

601
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,750
turn it when it gets hot all the way

602
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:38,210
through they start pulling and pulling

603
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,919
pulling until it narrows down against as

604
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,140
small as they want and they clip it off

605
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,450
you can cut it into these little slices

606
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,950
right here and then make a bead and

607
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,880
adhere it to the bead and it looks like

608
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:53,210
roses these down here are different kind

609
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,530
of marry me and then some folks have a

610
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,990
lot of fun we're doing with cartoon

611
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,100
characters and things so it all depends

612
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,230
on what you want to spend the time

613
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,549
learning to do I've got some samples of

614
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,470
some uini up here you may have seen this

615
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,850
this this floated around on reddit for a

616
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,010
while and it's been in the news a lot

617
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,860
want all those Wow have you seen this

618
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:17,720
kind of things this is Lauren stumps

619
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,959
work and like over here this is a

620
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,690
close-up you can see the detail in there

621
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:32,929
this slice they're sliced it off is

622
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:35,000
about that big $500 a slice what happens

623
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,000
is he had to do that like I told you how

624
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,340
the erosion was made all those layers

625
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,950
that you pull it out was skinny he does

626
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,860
that with each individual part each

627
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,270
eyeball each knows each mouth it has to

628
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,059
pull out like that and then go back and

629
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,440
put them together and melt them again

630
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:55,190
and pull them out

631
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,500
so it takes ages to do something like

632
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,790
this if you take us fights with lurid

633
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,520
stuff you basically work from 8:00 a.m.

634
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,860
to whenever you finish the next morning

635
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,540
because there's just so much to do you

636
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:10,310
can actually see on this one right here

637
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:15,830
the clear glass word was pulled so I

638
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:18,620
don't I'm going to give a quick shout

639
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,949
out right now to beat the courage it's a

640
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,199
group that we support all beat makers

641
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,840
beads of courage against handmade means

642
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,910
to kids who have catastrophic illness as

643
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,980
a way for them to record and tell their

644
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,200
stories when you're four and you're in

645
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,790
the hospital for a year you really don't

646
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,740
know how to explain that but if you have

647
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,899
a little yellow bead for every time you

648
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,050
got a shot and a black bead for every

649
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,190
night you're in the hospital and

650
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,200
glow-in-the-dark bead or whenever you

651
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,530
got an x-ray I mean they go on and on

652
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,140
and on when the kids hit a milestone

653
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,540
they get a dream beam they get sent off

654
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,110
to a bead artist and have a specialty

655
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:00,590
being made and if a child passes we make

656
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:03,110
butterfly beads for the parents it's an

657
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,010
awesome awesome program so if you're

658
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:08,540
ever looking for someone to support

659
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,800
they're wonderful wonderful people beads

660
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,960
of courage don't work if you want to

661
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:17,480
take a look and I got a few of my pieces

662
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,330
going here I'm gonna try to get the

663
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:30,140
video going in questions before step

664
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:31,580
forward handed out do is twisters yes

665
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,460
and there's gonna be one made in the

666
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,220
video

667
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:40,600
right it doesn't work you take two or

668
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:45,340
three or 40 pieces of glass get them hot

669
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:49,419
get them connected to each other twist

670
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:53,159
them and you pull them out to get them

671
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:59,410
that small then Terry will use them to

672
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:04,180
literally well what I say draw on the

673
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:07,750
glass so that feather is blast just like

674
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,750
this is or to do the little black greens

675
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,720
around that would just be a plain full

676
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,800
black but shows you all the different

677
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:21,820
things I'm talking so you can put your

678
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,379
video if you would like to come up and

679
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,220
take a look at any stuff I've got

680
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,230
examples of print and mandrels and jars

681
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,720
that I've blown we do that actually take

682
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,970
piece of stainless steel brake line dip

683
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,310
it in the clay mixture wrap the glass on

684
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,990
the end and blow it so it's what you've

685
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:45,159
seen the people on TV blow the great big

686
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:47,240
ones I so many questions

687
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,590
give me just a minute here and I'll try

688
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:55,310
to get this video going if you're

689
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:57,909
interested in the big loan stuff a lot

690
00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:03,260
of time to think about blowing glass I

691
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:05,530
would recommend Orbitz pop glass it's in

692
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,200
Fort Payne Alabama

693
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:13,670
he's been on when Oprah and her show he

694
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,090
was on twice as a yeah favorite things

695
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,000
and Christmas is here you can actually

696
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,070
go there and they have bows and Prince

697
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,010
lei now take out the trip

698
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:33,500
you want they will gather the glass on

699
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:38,900
the blowpipe and let you blow into it to

700
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:42,140
expand it yes Jen initiative Asheville

701
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:44,990
bunch of a Nashville does that one and

702
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,710
then they roll it and the sprit and do

703
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,710
all that stuff

704
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:59,218
yeah

705
00:30:51,179 --> 00:31:00,809
you know I say to me bad things I'm okay

706
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:03,509
so this is my little Alfa right here

707
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:05,879
I've got some white glass and with the

708
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:07,799
soda lime with more silicon you stick an

709
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,269
appointment i cough for silicon it's

710
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,190
fussy so you have to kind of tease it

711
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:18,559
into the flame but sticking your toe in

712
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:21,479
a hot tub of water would you say that be

713
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,869
the Alpha that you have is a good

714
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:29,210
beginners tour yes yes there are torches

715
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:32,009
you can get it at Hobby Lobby $75

716
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,499
they're frustrating and you actually use

717
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:35,729
a can of matte glass and hook it on the

718
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:39,419
table so you're sitting there with a

719
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:41,789
bomb in your lap yeah these torches are

720
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,879
much safer and you learn a much much

721
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:46,229
quicker on these okay there's the white

722
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,049
glass you can see kind of turned clear

723
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:50,609
I'm gonna pull a stringer one time T

724
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:54,839
really teaching the scientific

725
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:56,899
glassblower how to do the soft glass and

726
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:01,500
like you said

727
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,630
before so just think it complaining did

728
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,890
she kept warning him you can't do that

729
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,540
with soft blacks you have to tease it

730
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:13,080
well that's the second time I further

731
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:16,950
say that I start backing away and I saw

732
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:24,020
Terry back in a way lo and behold a few

733
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:24,020
seconds later tip of that just blew up

734
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,420
so I pulled the string up skinny and

735
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,860
laid it over the side this is one of the

736
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:37,190
stainless steel manuals they come in

737
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,189
different sizes

738
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:46,740
I've got tiny ones I use for jewelry and

739
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,300
then these bigger ones I use for not

740
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,880
blowing the little jars on them or

741
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:55,260
making Endora beep okay so I'm going to

742
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,590
start to make the bead I've eaten up the

743
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,060
mandrel and the tricky thing about this

744
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,679
that everybody is always surprised about

745
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,450
is when I'm teaching class it's the

746
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,710
first day of class awful okay here's

747
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,490
your here's your homework for tonight

748
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:13,320
thank this rod and learn to roll it in

749
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:18,450
your hand so you can keep it moving

750
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,870
and level and then after you learn to do

751
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,270
that

752
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,719
do the other hand to most if it did one

753
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:26,790
hand and then if you get that

754
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,220
now do it backwards come towards you so

755
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,659
you have to feel how the glass deflated

756
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,520
on there as to whether to go forward or

757
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,000
backwards what I've done here is I've

758
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,650
made a wrap around and made it like a

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,600
disc beat you see it's kind of like a

760
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,950
rope wrapped around the mandrel and I'm

761
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,659
gonna put a little dot here on the end

762
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,220
so that you can see how slowly I'm

763
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,420
turning it and when I turn it it's a

764
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,770
little hard to jump you can see that

765
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:54,030
little dot on the end there and it's

766
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,740
switching over to my right hand because

767
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,570
I can balance a little bit better now

768
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm heating the outside edge of that

769
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,700
that disc just the other edge because

770
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,390
when you heat glass has an interesting

771
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,630
property

772
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,250
it wants to be round so if you can

773
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,290
balance it it's going to turn it into a

774
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,909
ball as you're working so I'm trying to

775
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,909
heat the outer edge and have it sink

776
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,610
down on itself so that's a big fat round

777
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,940
rope around that mandrel just what make

778
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,940
speed

779
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,960
a lot of the shaping is done outside the

780
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,040
flame that's always surprising the

781
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,429
people who try this when they first

782
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,840
start out I think you've got to get in

783
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,210
the flame and get it soupy hot and then

784
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,020
it gets floppy and it starts to spin out

785
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,429
of control you learn to turn it get it

786
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,900
bright orange like this and come out of

787
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,960
the flame and keep turning and the glass

788
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,920
will continue to settle down it's all

789
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:51,060
about heat gravity and heat control your

790
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:53,180
glasses actually that's with the glasses

791
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,840
you're looking through a diamond plating

792
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,970
it's probably three or four times that

793
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,620
bright without it

794
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,029
and likes they won't hurt your eyes but

795
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,060
you'll be really really tired your eyes

796
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:08,130
will be dry very quickly okay can you

797
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,660
see that melted down into like a basic

798
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,750
they were called rondell shape or a

799
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,250
doughnut shaped bead now real quickly if

800
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,730
you want to be a beating snob I'll tell

801
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,650
you what I think the look for we around

802
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,900
the hole if we've got the bead laying

803
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,030
here and the hole is on top the sides of

804
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,150
the beach come up and dip down so that

805
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:30,420
the hole is in the little Valley two

806
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:32,730
reasons one it protects whatever you

807
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,110
string it on just straight up and down

808
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:38,340
it makes a saw out of it and if you make

809
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,110
sure it's got the Creole valleys on each

810
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,090
end that shows you had the workmanship

811
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,710
to make it like you wanted you'll

812
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,859
accidentally get those sometimes but if

813
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,589
you consistently get those on your baby

814
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:53,328
whurling here I'm putting dots on

815
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:54,739
the bead I took that stringer just heat

816
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,420
up the glass and put the little dots on

817
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:59,779
there I'm gonna go back over here put it

818
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,730
on the side in an alternating pattern I

819
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:03,170
talked about Brad Pearson the one with

820
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,799
the big marble I showed you first he

821
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,390
taught me how to put dots on and he's so

822
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:09,130
intent he actually does it between

823
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,970
heartbeats

824
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:15,619
to get it hit at the right place I hold

825
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:19,970
my breath when I do it I have a little

826
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,680
pattern I did where I touch and it's a

827
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,808
good pattern to get into a good rhythm

828
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,868
when you put the dots on cuz that's

829
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:28,249
harder than it looks to get them in the

830
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:32,960
right place I have to write them out

831
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:34,578
each time and you've probably seen beads

832
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,180
like this with the little rows of dots

833
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:37,180
on them

834
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,850
never needed a little more

835
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,520
someone turned into flame and trying to

836
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,990
heat just the dots I've got my face the

837
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,610
way I wanted I don't want to melt it

838
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,930
again I want to keep it warm though if I

839
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:59,330
let that bakes cool off it's going to

840
00:36:53,930 --> 00:37:00,770
break in half or explode I am now

841
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,180
because I'm trying to heat the little

842
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:04,190
dots and I'm trying to get the heat to

843
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,029
do the same all the way around pretty

844
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:10,730
quickly and when you first put the dots

845
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,710
on I think with a tip each other they

846
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,060
stand up like this if I want to do is

847
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,760
heat them enough that they spread up

848
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,590
make a dome because if they're tippy-toe

849
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,020
of filling them into the ball if you

850
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,590
bump it the fall off you want as much of

851
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:27,040
that area touching the base as possible

852
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:32,620
do you have to do you have to use a

853
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,620
higher melting glass for the initial

854
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:38,049
let's use large glass

855
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:47,070
now as you melt those dots they they

856
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,629
sink in or smooth out so I can leave the

857
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,250
dot standing up where I can milk them

858
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:54,110
until they're actually smooth with the

859
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:56,190
surface of the surface of the bead and

860
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,570
right there I'm just trying to check and

861
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,490
make sure everybody's melted in see the

862
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,050
dots disappear they turn clear and you

863
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,049
come out of the flame and turn and they

864
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,880
turn back to light so when I see that

865
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,680
clear where the white should be I know

866
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,710
that how hot it is it's extremely

867
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
running hot there you go all the dots

868
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:17,270
are disappearing it's trying to melt

869
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
them in and then they come back

870
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:23,150
and then once I'm happy with that I'll

871
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,610
grab some black I was trying to get

872
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,610
colors you can see on the video you come

873
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,900
and put a dot on top and you notice

874
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,510
these little handlebars I have right

875
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:36,470
here those are just little wrist wrists

876
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:38,210
and they're not firmly in position I

877
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,680
just got those like when you go down

878
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,780
your stairs at home any put your hand on

879
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,850
the rail look you don't give it a death

880
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,440
grip you just kind of lightly put your

881
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,630
hand on it to kind of get your balance

882
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,550
you know as you drop down the stairs

883
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,770
that's kind of a beastie thing they let

884
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,840
me put my hands in a single location and

885
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,810
that way I'm not moving and without

886
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,490
realizing it so there's a little black

887
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:04,160
dot right on top of the white ones there

888
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:06,020
and then when I finish a bead it goes

889
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,940
into a kiln if I were to put that down

890
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,520
on the table or in a bucket of sand or

891
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,320
vermiculite let it cool there's a lot of

892
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,970
stress in the bead when you put the bead

893
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
in the flame you get it really really

894
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,939
hot so those molecules are really going

895
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,669
crazy and then you pull it out to

896
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,050
decorate it in the freezer the shape and

897
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,520
they put your decoration on you go back

898
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,790
into the flame and they start moving

899
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,380
again if you once they're so excited you

900
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,640
can never get them lined up again so

901
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,240
there's a good Network holding that

902
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,040
thing together so what I do is take it

903
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,649
when I'm finished put it in a kiln it

904
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,080
sits at 960 degrees for an hour which is

905
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,640
just below the melting point it lets

906
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,710
that be it's exactly the same

907
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,259
temperature all the way through and then

908
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,410
my kiln steps down it cools off over

909
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,430
several hours

910
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,100
it's it's a very slow cooling process

911
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,600
your crap score beats they don't do that

912
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,790
they're just stuck in sand if anything

913
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,270
or they're just they make on the rock

914
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:04,620
drum in a pile so basically it's an

915
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:06,300
annealer yes okay I'm gonna try to speed

916
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,970
this up a bit I'm making a twisty I've

917
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:13,740
got a metal rod with no none of the clay

918
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:18,540
slip on it and I'm putting some pea

919
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,720
green or as we call it Kermit green and

920
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,680
I'm just putting a ball on the end of it

921
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,180
we'll try to speed this up because I

922
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,310
realized I was putting a lot of stuff on

923
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,020
here I came back in after made the ball

924
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,420
and I put two white stripes you can see

925
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,370
that on there and I'm gonna come back

926
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,370
and put some turquoise stripes on it

927
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,710
and I think I actually need to put a

928
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,560
little bit of black on there too

929
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,450
yep there's the black when you work with

930
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,190
glass that thin you gotta learn

931
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,509
Niq techniques to get it to go where you

932
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,510
wanted to go without melting in half

933
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,230
and then

934
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,570
I'm gonna check in another no I'm sorry

935
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,569
fix to the black right there

936
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,069
I took another metal rod heated the end

937
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,540
of it stuck it into the glass so I've

938
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,480
got a hand only beside those are called

939
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:19,240
pun T's and now I'm turning my hands

940
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,720
together you say the lines are staying

941
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,979
kind of straight over all the colors I'm

942
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,359
going back and forth what I'm trying to

943
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,480
just get the heat cook all the way

944
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,010
through I tell my students not cooking a

945
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,140
chicken if you put it on a rotisserie

946
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,580
and spin it really fast you can burn the

947
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,290
outside still have raw chicken in the

948
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,799
middle what you want to do is with this

949
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:40,330
is turn it slowly but the heats so curly

950
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,440
you see how it's turning orange all the

951
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,340
way through now there aren't any real

952
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,340
dark spots in it

953
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,330
the students dip rods will transfer heat

954
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,730
and glass does it transfer heat there's

955
00:41:53,330 --> 00:42:00,410
some ambient heat to the side but it's

956
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:05,390
not hot and then I'm turning one hand in

957
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:11,420
one direction one in the other I have

958
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:13,730
some samples I love baking these turn

959
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,050
fast and pull apart turn fast and pull

960
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,120
apart and then the glass says I'm done

961
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:20,480
it firms up it tells you when it's done

962
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,650
you twist it far enough rate let see if

963
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,210
everything's I've let go with the other

964
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,830
hand in the help no I haven't liked it

965
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,390
you gonna burn it off and there

966
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,950
sometimes it breaks off on one end

967
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,509
whatever you're doing that and will

968
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,339
superheat that and stick it with water

969
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:37,310
that glass will shock and break off and

970
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,900
you can use that metal rod again and

971
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:41,480
with the other side I have to take my

972
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:45,830
very specialized Ace Hardware pliers and

973
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,220
dip them in water yeah if it doesn't

974
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:52,160
melt we'll use it for it too

975
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,509
okay fish sculpting i speeded this up a

976
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,529
little bit and try not to keep you guys

977
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:59,000
too late i took one of my stainless

978
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,860
steel rods different than clay make sure

979
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,930
but I'm working off the end I'm making a

980
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,400
sculpture so all I'll do this with one

981
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,310
hole in the bottom of the fish then make

982
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,160
a stand and sit on top of it but I'm

983
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,900
just making a ball of glass there and

984
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,310
you can see this kind of turn into a

985
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,270
ball pretty quickly remember the white

986
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,460
melts really really

987
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,910
so it's gonna farm up into or shake up

988
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,910
into a ball

989
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,619
see you around that is already

990
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:37,629
Wow bus want to come in okay this is

991
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,700
nice and warm now and I'm gonna heat it

992
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,640
up a little bit and see the red up there

993
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,310
in the little gold that's Frick

994
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,910
it's what Frick the ground of last we

995
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:50,349
talked about the intense colors so we'll

996
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:54,970
get that nice and warm and I'll go in

997
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:58,480
and get some Fred and then just put it

998
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:02,669
back in the flame and melt it in and it

999
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,670
just be some nice models decoration

1000
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,549
you know what's good for just a little

1001
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,049
bit I've shape the glass by holding it

1002
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,760
in the heat and letting one side droop

1003
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:18,350
down and I turned over at the other side

1004
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,350
root down so I've got a fish body shape

1005
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:32,279
you singer homeboy I do

1006
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:35,910
sometimes I think out loud keeps me from

1007
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,710
cursing time okay so they put some high

1008
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,379
balls on or at least basis for the high

1009
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:43,770
ball just a little bit of Blackcomb

1010
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,780
there to give me a pad to put it on and

1011
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:48,350
that's just a little too I used to match

1012
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:54,440
the dot down and make it a flat circle

1013
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:56,580
that's why I don't put them in the flame

1014
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,210
okay so if you make big you're gonna put

1015
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,210
some white on

1016
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,720
okay and then come back and put a little

1017
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,319
dot of black and C's personality

1018
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,319
starting to come out

1019
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,520
and then we put a clear lens over each

1020
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:20,630
eye just to magnify and make it look

1021
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,630
this year

1022
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,320
if make sound effects when you work with

1023
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:30,450
glass - okay here I'm putting this I

1024
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,490
guess her lips on I used a bright red

1025
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,720
and I put a big ball of glass on the end

1026
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,339
looks like she's blowing bubble gum and

1027
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,419
I'm gonna heat it up and take my trusty

1028
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:43,589
now I even come on hurry what I'm doing

1029
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,089
is I'm trying to heat it up and then

1030
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:47,520
tilt it back on top so that it melts

1031
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:50,279
down it doesn't like stretch out because

1032
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,930
it will just stretch out the drip okay

1033
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,820
so got my trusty little knife and I go

1034
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,490
in and cut that in half and rock it back

1035
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:01,290
and forth and all sudden she's got big

1036
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:20,189
luscious lips visually I call these book

1037
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:21,259
toxic Guppies carp dashians you get what

1038
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,450
you pay for

1039
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,339
okay so now I'm gonna go in with a

1040
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,379
little bit of clear and I'm gonna put a

1041
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:32,040
stripe down and back malefic that was

1042
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:34,829
fun and I'm gonna put some on the tail

1043
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,270
and if you see I keep going back in the

1044
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:37,829
flame I've got to keep that glass some

1045
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:42,420
warm so I've got it in and out of the

1046
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:44,609
flame to keep it warm and still because

1047
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,970
I put big thick stripes on the back and

1048
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:46,970
the tail

1049
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,069
do you have that one here I don't and I

1050
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,089
don't know that I have a fish with me

1051
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:54,230
we're gonna go about the studio I'll

1052
00:46:53,089 --> 00:47:01,328
pick it up on the way and we got your

1053
00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:01,329
running light and just didn't get it

1054
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,510
okay you can see this big thick on the

1055
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:12,340
back there and now I'm thinking about

1056
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:14,890
flyers my handy-dandy base Flyers

1057
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,230
non-serrated Flyers I'm heating all of

1058
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,060
this and because the thin and tail are

1059
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,650
really thin I'd be careful about heating

1060
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,660
I've got to keep it warm but I can't get

1061
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,090
it too hot or it's gonna melt then sink

1062
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,190
into the other but I want to keep it

1063
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,960
from breaking so I'm heating up the sack

1064
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,560
then I'm gonna take my pliers this isn't

1065
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,020
through a moment and pinch the Flyers

1066
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,130
they just go around the edge

1067
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,170
those are dick pliers let's get a little

1068
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,390
bit pardon oh and you're ruffling the

1069
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:48,220
yeah I'm ruffling the fins on it with

1070
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:51,609
the pliers so spin that around so it

1071
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:55,290
gets the warmer and the mantra right

1072
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,290
here is to be right don't break them

1073
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:03,250
then you put too much glass on a rod and

1074
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:07,569
then you just go oh yeah oh yeah you're

1075
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:10,030
only getting the glamor shots here good

1076
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:11,589
ever to be pretty bad a beat goes bad we

1077
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,750
got a cup of water for putting on little

1078
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,160
bits of glass in and stuff and sometimes

1079
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,900
we call it water and kneeling if one

1080
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,960
just goes south so far it can't be saved

1081
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,490
just Shh it's quite a satisfying sound

1082
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,000
when you had a naughty beating you get

1083
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:26,529
to give it a very listen

1084
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,789
okay so you see there's a little ruffled

1085
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:32,440
feathers the minute up feather spins and

1086
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:35,049
then I'll go in I like to go one step

1087
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,490
farther and actually twist them a little

1088
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:40,270
bit so it gets motion so it looks like

1089
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:46,118
the fish is in water got some motion to

1090
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:48,700
it I'm guessing you sell some of these

1091
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,309
hopefully yes cuz it's an expensive

1092
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,950
hobby my glass lot people ask about the

1093
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:56,020
glass the glass runs about 10-12 dollars

1094
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:58,328
a pound which is about 20 sticks

1095
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,770
football sticks depending on what's in

1096
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:05,039
it that's pretty cheap there's some it's

1097
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:05,038
$100 a pound you use that very sparingly

1098
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,950
but there's fish

1099
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:18,679
there you go just pour mine in the fish

1100
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:19,819
fryer I've tried to spin it bets just to

1101
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:22,809
get a little heat in there before it

1102
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:22,808
goes in the kiln and

1103
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,970
my vices cut off

1104
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,869
[Applause]
