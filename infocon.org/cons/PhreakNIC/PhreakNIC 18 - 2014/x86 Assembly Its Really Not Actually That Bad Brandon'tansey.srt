1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,330
okay and so the first question is why
don't you miss

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,429
nation at the together like a mother to
win over DC or

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,179
I'm is like the local I would like to I
put together

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,119
someone the month before me the tongs
I'm his response to think that I

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,750
was doing for a bit now I'm balances on
an interest in the topic

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,300
as we get a little presentation about
different network forensics stuff

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,830
I every time you got your number now
says he kind of like looking it up

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,900
I'm safford asking why

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,489
will also miss kahn Design I'm into
thing that makes your life

10
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,068
people can't have that reaction to
assembly and I really don't think it's

11
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:41,579
that that's the idea

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,579
I'm on this presentation was today again
convinced people easy for

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,539
for up over the presentation want to go
through a couple things

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,620
on the first was what is something which
and

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,409
probably a logical progression also was
it worth knowing

16
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,089
then we're going to some like basic
operate basic explains how it works

17
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:02,659
I'm so basically architecture x86 and
the fundamentals

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,330
I like ministers instructions memory and
if you're so inclined

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,039
where you can go from there we're
getting there

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,500
okay as the side to

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,399
reach you boom okay I'm so that was what
is the presentation

22
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,140
and so this is what is the presentation
now and this is not new clothes was the

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,020
thing that's not

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,259
I miss the couple that I want to
highlight eyes not ninety-six and the

25
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,140
Masterclass

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,210
for a couple reasons one I

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,369
only have about 45 minutes but to
YouTube Hamilton world I'm not the one

28
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,580
teaching hospitals

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,140
and they don't know everything there is
to know even close to that comment you

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,610
this is an hour now Spanish

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,810
and so have this inside for these people
think she said I was going to do our

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,420
nails

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,659
presentation and that was something I
sent back was

34
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,280
not immediately I am doing now in its
presentation directly after this

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,659
I am so if that like the noise you

36
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,159
don't worry it's home so the logical
first question is what is assembly

37
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,729
language

38
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm so it doesn't seem to play out here

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,959
on this issue hours me is one of the two
of us

40
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,260
and you've got a shiny new right I'm
here shiny new

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,190
here has an Intel processor many has a
processor that Intel that would say

42
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,260
we're gonna go with it

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,950
your officers really cool right what all
your friends W

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,040
years have the same as the just so

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,530
I the right since we see hope for

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,489
Zazzle small um and maybe like them
directly walking you sorry

47
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,930
but rather sleazy hotel a local see all
sideburns and coat got a new computer

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,720
watch all your friends are fools

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,049
unfortunately your Intel processor does
not months you cannot give that your

50
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:46,540
processor

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,359
have money right I so those were my list

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,870
so for sure there's compiler made
specifically for the type of processing

53
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,180
you can give your city it takes in and
it doesn't bunch of stuff to interact

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,090
with the processor

55
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,780
so you can monitor so against Texas
really small so actually supposed to be

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,240
read

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,840
adjust the output file on the line I'm
just a couple specific things

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm smell 32-bit LSB excusable Intel
eighty

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,100
36 version won't just be an unlinked all
this stuff basically saying this is made

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,760
specifically for your posts

61
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,160
the type of processor on that you have
so was it in that state you connected

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,109
your problem

63
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,450
um to you in order to show all over
print

64
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,940
to your program says hello world all
your friends are stoked everyone decided

65
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,440
good job really beautiful and the
question is what actually makes

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,220
a so appears on your mind you see
something like this up here

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,070
I'm mid I put the Stevens online for you
really say

68
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,660
some I R you saw number readable I'm but
this is what is on your mind

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,070
is just a buncha bits and bytes I'm here
we represented in his hands

70
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm so full disclosure this isn't the
whole binary this is the main function

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,080
and this is actually what it is I mean
this is exactly where someone's

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,350
because all those things translate
directly to assembly instructions

73
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,220
that again this is where sampling was
kinda comes in on the cheek and so is

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,120
every language

75
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,300
is known bits and bytes random hacks
which makes up the money which makes the

76
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,330
call the Jeep

77
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,220
so that's what I say sexism is I'm so
very lovable second

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,900
why do you care on the compilers our
thing in the world

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,429
answering a question and i got I think
three reasons for

80
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,720
maybe two novels I saw the first reason
that you can

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,510
it helps you to write better code
released understand it better and so

82
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,240
issue

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,010
explain what I mean by that person
islamic this concept here on a lovely

84
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,110
blue on this line

85
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,670
I mean let's bring them around as well
you home

86
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,970
them and let you look at it and they
were just a concept but just to make it

87
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,500
clear

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,870
I'm we know there's no low-level and
high-level

89
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,720
those numbers of people only but it
works and that was how we like does

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,100
I'm not in real life low-level means I

91
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,280
typically lesson plans rights amassed
little ones a little

92
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,530
course map 2012 more complex hired

93
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,549
math real one will energise is right on
this the hassle of course

94
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,110
in my example title has been plus

95
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,160
so the higher level something is the
more best us but that is almost the

96
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,230
complete opposite

97
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,700
I'm in terms of tech so the heart a
little something isn't

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,960
tech released in time to the computer
language the more abstract it is

99
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,200
i'm for the processors actually house as
an example have I thought as much as a

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,950
language

101
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,950
and the things that I thought was kinda
like a plague know you can do you

102
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,050
basically if you want them to worry
about how the less actually

103
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,919
deals with clergy I don't think that's
like talk bad about

104
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,909
I think that's awesome I love the colour
writings and I and I think that is very

105
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,669
attractive

106
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,870
season lol I mean it's not because it is

107
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,650
lesson fans are less complex some might
argue the opposite

108
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,799
but yes less attractive than

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,010
I and you will do it was something like
pointers directly

110
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,930
I'm but there's also still a lot
happening and that you're not there

111
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,330
control again you see that because the
fact he's compiled

112
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,710
right you give it to see instruction
percy

113
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,930
instruction was a policy and the
compiler cases as okay here's a niece

114
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,500
YouTube to process and that's it
together and then below that still isn't

115
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,860
as I say not with an asterisk because
I'm really scared what happened

116
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,470
statements

117
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,590
I'm but it's very there's very little
traction

118
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,260
I'm if and and see all about that that
laughing track is what makes assembly

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,980
low-level

120
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,210
which times as I know people who knows
and left for her limbs sexy as

121
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,880
high-level

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,460
observe you learn this and you get to do
that %um press conference developing

123
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,010
countries don't do that people

124
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,750
I'm so excited or not this life with
couple minutes ago

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,180
on why because I hope you write that
pose or at least understood

126
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,870
so you know after the wedding is
something which I wager that most people

127
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,410
who

128
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,480
a no assembly don't I'm

129
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,530
it'll kinda you that understanding what
are our little do so when you see how

130
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,309
these like winners were no tax work in
the same level

131
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,450
I mean kinda makes it much easier to
understand what's happening under the

132
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,539
covers in your writing

133
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,720
Python assembly here receive $500,000

134
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,120
whatever like you I'm initially

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,200
you're wrestling at making more sense
and I said because one

136
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,800
you've got some kind of all that happens
to be the issue something a little less

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,630
and if you're

138
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,450
really with the family on that one
inning the very most

139
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,080
love them

140
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,450
and was okay cool after this for me the
biggest reason

141
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,450
almond eyes as a whole new world so that
you can really know simply

142
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,300
I'm summers and very things i think is
gonna what the problem was that

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,130
typically do not reverse engineering

144
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,060
open source document sometimes you are
not to say that he's he

145
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,500
a lot and it's impossible I was just
trying to dig into I mean being able to

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,840
this and that was awesome

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,590
you can take that binary which is for a
lot of people like basically

148
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,719
a black box you can really get into it
you can take that is exactly how it

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,240
works

150
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,330
and do you think that no one else is
which is probably the best thing you can

151
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,580
do

152
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,970
and I seventy I'm wrestling development
her

153
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,940
reading the source code extended
whatever I miss you can we issue

154
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,469
close by D and a lot according to you
that you otherwise could

155
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,230
and initially I think sometimes workers
into your own home as well

156
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,710
I'm chillin think about it when you
bring home you think you know it does

157
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,809
I disagree I think you know what you
wanted to do

158
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,869
but you don't necessarily know who's I'm
in this and your own

159
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,870
kinda LBC was actually on covers

160
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,850
and and say you're not a reliable I'm
here

161
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,820
and Jess you don't have to I'll talk
about his exact example nice

162
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,490
presentation

163
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,180
want to show a real-world example were
no is on the image to be something

164
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,859
genuinely

165
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,560
and so this was from

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,489
particular reason I learned to explain
it more here but I guess

167
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,150
oil is a national teams presentation
which is directly after so wat

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm but ever since hearing this local
we're able to predict the actions of a

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,930
particular

170
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,569
problematic he's a malware I'm to
reproduce in effectively help prevent

171
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,620
for people who have this information so
the hanger you know that was sick

172
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,620
was will position against so the last
week and this is what I call have reason

173
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,189
because he doesn't even it's not a big
one for me in the Spurs

174
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,900
as you can might simply as in here knows
only

175
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,730
and easily okay Budgam

176
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,450
Langhans I'm someone actively rights in
the trash

177
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,760
no absolutely so you sample size

178
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,900
but I love you no assembly generally do

179
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,630
right now my hand I'm example early 70 s
Show

180
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,060
when someone's gonna bring up to be like
two days ago today because I don't you

181
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,859
love Joe

182
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,070
I'm political things so I'm

183
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,170
you can write assembly if you've learned
it again it's not only the major reason

184
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,630
I'd

185
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,650
I push so

186
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,660
okay at this point will get started yes
I'm

187
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,660
doesn't have any questions at this point
are a couple times yeah

188
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,229
yeah you have differentiated reason
Williams

189
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,680
and good around a lot media

190
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,319
things whose seems like you call
plunging

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,279
and living will get their own
differences between the duo

192
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,490
make and

193
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,370
yeah that'll come in there is little bit
of an instruction elections

194
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,720
and okay as 13 back of life a little bit
earlier

195
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,829
I'm to talk about what actually
distinguishes warnings and even having

196
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:46,380
to another

197
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,790
its I'm sluggers in years it was a very
low level

198
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,779
I'm so what does it mean to learn a
little like should apply the same things

199
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,029
one easy after coming from

200
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,769
i dont wanna I'm and that is the fact
that you have a link to this helps

201
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:00,459
traction

202
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,079
you have to learn what is generally
attract the other line generally

203
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,510
use answer the first part of 27 his
legacy

204
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,920
you don't have a deal as a person ever
going to talk about actually going to be

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,130
he's on the instructions which we will
get you

206
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,240
I'm so was attracted had was on the line
is that you have to deal with here

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,089
are the exact words process I'm so into
never going to be talking about the

208
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:23,970
Intel 32

209
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,640
until they reach you and and this is the
usual 32-bit and 64-bit architecture

210
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,160
manual

211
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,170
I'm is a really good home I guess it has
huge

212
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,290
engage assembly I'm but after this
recovery's

213
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,029
one that actually pays one out of three
thousand 439 you're not as if he wants

214
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:43,689
to hear

215
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,020
but it's still not a short thing an
initiative for two reasons

216
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm the first is is a fantastic resource
as you learned

217
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,040
through things I sound like a mandate is
right on this as a great reference and

218
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,290
also to give instructions have different
answers were

219
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,930
pretty much everything you need to know
can be found in here and it's really not

220
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,609
eventually

221
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,430
not coming up love your question that
you are thinking it will

222
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,410
and usually it was worth again this is
page 1

223
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,449
3,430 I'm not at all

224
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,040
non-woven and I can still function right
mishandled unwilling to show

225
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
you have to be the wizard and get and
you

226
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,970
be functional with much specifically
until 30 June

227
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,970
X's so

228
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,399
okay I'm what we're going to talk about
putting out first our processes

229
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,959
right as we do have some contamination
before we dive into the instructions

230
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,670
I so earlier shows you at this summer's
Michael

231
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,089
an abrupt end to Syria's instructions
and

232
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:50,980
instructions are on for this which is my
processor ESP that decision is in the

233
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,470
the shade in the background this is
where

234
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,200
was not like sushi I I'm so you from the
road from here the processor

235
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,740
I was actually does things I miss the
scientific journal

236
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,339
processors on it has a beautiful inside
and it happened three of them were

237
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,260
people's the first in the AL humor the
arithmetic logic

238
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,020
at the Ale you when he was using logic
and this is where the action was rushing

239
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,220
the process for lunch

240
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,780
happens I'm we're not in from the right
one right smokers would like to know

241
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,280
about

242
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm but you don't have to be visiting

243
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,530
but want to know that this is where the
logic actually occurs if you ever take a

244
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,510
lot of course

245
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,000
you're talking about gays earlier this
is for gays is to you

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,350
get you back for solutions little I'm

247
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,740
in the processors think that does things
is that you wrote that

248
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,570
I'm this the no midterms

249
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,890
answer the second part of controlling I
mean this is one we will have to YouTube

250
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,990
morning to you but it's good to know
that it exists

251
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,360
absolutely nothing about it. ginger I
was was it the

252
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,750
I'm have someone you got my season

253
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,990
you like to place I you tell you must
use your song like a plan we'll see

254
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,740
assassination different seasons will
find the right one and as as the

255
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,280
conscience

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,089
that at you Livermore to see Blair
please that's how I got it wrong

257
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,590
it gets for instructions on the
sidelines grown-up what values

258
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,390
bash what lot of patience to do I'm so
again

259
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,830
out the things that people is the
processor will go through you well you

260
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,560
don't have the G

261
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,839
know too much more about this specific
on the news worth knowing

262
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,110
and left arm across channels of an
in-depth are the Rams

263
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,130
I've got a whole section dedicated
registers I will talk about it too much

264
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,580
now

265
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,570
and that this is kinda like your work
easier yeah

266
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,110
now we know working space inside passes
need to be very very very important

267
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,380
I'm going in will get into

268
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,689
more in-depth missile so

269
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,720
on this is my scale after dining room on
the computer mom

270
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,470
and you're going to step down in
december have a few thrusts Andrew said

271
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,140
on the simple

272
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,610
from I'm so you got a problem with your
friend some even while

273
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,930
United 20 memory spoilers yes I'm

274
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,630
Sydney's is on on your hard drive for
storage I'm it does that mean the source

275
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,120
she

276
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,360
relatively cheap I'm is little was

277
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,920
and it'll be by Angie I'm and persistent
money shut down we'll see what's on your

278
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,630
sources

279
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,530
um lonely SU binary you don't want it
from a hard

280
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,600
right I'm you could easier sup

281
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,930
better memory RAM as a memory when
compared to storage

282
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm is a lot faster I'm accessing it if
you re raisers even cheaper

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,790
but the thing is is a lot more than
quality

284
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,680
quantity nice you this space is a hard
I'm

285
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,050
so we usually need you you know
easy-to-use in with you

286
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,520
the event on 27 storage we want to ask
you for

287
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,250
we love you all have his and memory
executed from their use

288
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,230
I'm so this is where ministers so can
register sales

289
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,940
he are the sea and producers are memory

290
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,360
this is a americans are renders our
memory

291
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,060
well memory storage and administers

292
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,270
even care to everyone national he's
opened her juicy story

293
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,549
are very very very very limited

294
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:16,660
and how much money use sort of us is a
registered in a moment

295
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,529
and this evening we talk or register you
talk about the NBA's

296
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,999
makes reading lights we talk about
minutes um

297
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:30,019
at least in you tell their judaism the
human person every they're significantly

298
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:30,670
cheaper

299
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,559
I'm access perceived I'm selections that
as much as possible to keep

300
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,480
an hour you from running and as

301
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,790
sorry traction and challenge so

302
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,889
'em what I like to show you awesome the
structural

303
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,420
runs I'm so this result yes will get his

304
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,559
ruptures how they work a little bit this
one's

305
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,920
pounds on the top handle size chart all
at 10

306
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
8 16 24 than there he wasn't there but

307
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,408
little things that use so in in tel +32

308
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:08,250
something the size and register like
this is 30 this

309
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,220
water or ice annals of 27

310
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,180
yes as well as general purpose registers
a whole

311
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,360
anything in the incident the thing is
that I think that you know withhold

312
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,990
but he didn't think the issue 32 bit
noses Yes Minister

313
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,310
access for whoever would like to do with
it and when you read from the ASU get 32

314
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,810
is a

315
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,649
we can also break up into a small part

316
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,410
so yeah is 32 bits a a sixty

317
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,840
and salute review for united nationalism
first

318
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,780
I'm East he is as for san dimas before
32-bit processors that resisted arrest

319
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,180
there's no reason that we not that one

320
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,260
well we have and so a yes

321
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,580
compared yes there's a couple things
like these processors and that wasn't

322
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,260
home

323
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,000
if you can write I'm a program

324
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,540
represents a XPS yes and as far as I'm
worst

325
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,860
work out for you right as in all that is
the same way I'm but also sometimes you

326
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,290
like taxes the lower half

327
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,440
over mister that were runs one so it was
the first 16 is

328
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,230
yes yes all I'm well as a person

329
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,380
lower house so the problem here on this
out he not address

330
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,440
directly the second half happened the
same passion

331
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,090
other ways you can use a certain
pathological others

332
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,379
like a other letters doesn't it

333
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,659
other Hathaway so

334
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,230
home we can bring up some other officers
one more I'm

335
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,880
you know RI was one of the safest
rotation

336
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,830
I think I wasn't that much haha rose
summer 10 minutes late and I'll

337
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,960
any some that we can break up the house
11 so we didn't do it

338
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,850
AL for a lower or age Sohail this is the
first by

339
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,959
greatness whereas ages I just like a
regressor they axe

340
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,480
we cannot directly asses the top over a
certain age

341
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,570
and so we're here at yes as:

342
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,840
a JL register call EDS the EDS

343
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,789
yes the Asian here I'm so most large
cities and me since

344
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,140
in that fashion so they don't have a
look and feel

345
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,429
fortunately I'm you can see the more the
merrier

346
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,169
when you're you know they were you
reading this and leave it was a good

347
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:29,770
learning

348
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,580
she had no they're not happy to remember
answer these are all the general purpose

349
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,340
lanes

350
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,470
so many have the same second and he's
basically used for anything like

351
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,870
that said unit in june summers in your
writing

352
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,289
I'm so that works with loses using the

353
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,000
and there are certain I'm practices at
my little

354
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,659
so one can easily be used for any into
them

355
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,679
busy sorry this happened with mild

356
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,809
this doesn't act different analysts
there I'll talk about a couple now

357
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:08,379
I'm not only got about yes yes or no
soon as I

358
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,820
yes and ECS juvenile transfers

359
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,240
and that yes is level is the return
mystery out of that

360
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,120
3400 3989 I'm

361
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,439
so it is only when he returned it
doesn't work like a lot Arnold

362
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,440
on is your Python missus he said those

363
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,090
long as I know and if that happens she
returned the Italian like

364
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,350
innocently I'm the return

365
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,129
she doesn't she pastel that it is
because he was an easy whatever value

366
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,620
like surgery in the AM's and see also
his brother

367
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,709
a hundred calculations well one of the
leading trainers in

368
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,750
cohesive culture you results

369
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,799
yes little I just want to clarify

370
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,250
yes because I hope he isn't

371
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,549
and this is actually anyhow the end

372
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,030
manual all that important other

373
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm it again I'll leaves

374

certain customers use for

375
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,830
there are some instructions that the
logicalis

376
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,669
organism I'm more than a little concern

377
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,880
times enabling easy access their me
isn't happening in the country for those

378

and so we really need you now orange on
So You Think

474
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,930
solutions and earlier unless you use
this

475
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,410
this point we talked about sources of
about

this is Hector presentation many my
little

479
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,740
grouping is hopping on December

480

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,550
third-person past as

500
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,750
sealer for is he was a necessity

501
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,300
muskrat muskrat and the only thing I was
years later

502
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,350
cycle one thing Latin I'm I'm so easy

503
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,709
and LPC aldrich PCs cool so it's like
rewritten or French

504
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,120
my devices working a lot easier than
having three were

505
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,689
on Fillmore minus his that nice

506

ass in line with my sis you can hear
them

507
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,460
so I'll cook 55 directly translate

508
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,180
pushing yeah it's pretty easy and all
that you have to know that a

509
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,210
his push in the five parcels

510
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,810
registry necessary after that okay

511
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,100
movie yet 895

512
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,610
I don't know which one that is the issue
yes

513
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,969
89 new I have none who have no

514
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,390
actuals I'm younger

515
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,460
on it the nation online proper I hope
your

516
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,030
offer ends meet up for them somalis push

517
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,720
so is a push anything like to push and
alls

518
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,860
play in the instruction little bit
thinking like to push

519
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,570
is he the music was pp is a lot you're
having to figure out 55

520
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,620
answer just a

521
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,830
another player here I'm so I hope at
least

522
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,540
baby one personally go back to the room
homework whatever might have done

523
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,270
something

524
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,460
or restlessness and if you do you

525
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,000
this is what I've shown you I'm if you
do what you like to see will probably

526
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,919
like that

527
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,000
and that's because a lot of tools that
lead to the ceiling

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,830
when it's a few minutes um use 18
seasons

529
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,270
now you have to know that this is the
same exact December they will deal with

530
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,750
the see instruction set

531
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,100
everything is the same as a different is
no way represent a

532
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,820
displaying assemblage there's a major
difference is like a Intel

533
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,770
for movie he is P I mean if we look at
this and other AT&T

534
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,629
it's moving yessiree that's because the
order viagra under switch

535
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,059
the office he didn't like cents on the
dollar signs

536
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,530
it's the same you can view things and we

537
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,940
either discussions yeah owner

538
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,490
did he know dollars the

539
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,390
dollar so its peers I'm

540
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,690
I wanna secretaries and health success

541
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,840
so it will be years yet whitey do

542
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,770
also if you have a las Vegas is kinda it
defines what's coming next

543
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:56,030
what you need to see a dollar sign to
know that 00 me about you

544
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,730
and persons I tell yes his arrest as I

545
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,180
yeah Richard yet maybe something I don't
know

546
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,450
younger here

547
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,830
yeah I guess it is more explicit in
certain things

548
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,010
I'm I don't know and again I'm

549
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,270
another with the ones that are the other
because I don't know much about 18

550
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,050
seasons

551
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:24,120
and let you know that 18 seals are
definitely

552
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,860
right thank you counsel worse number
nice want to use it like a long time the

553
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,040
try this I can use only and the like
this isn't something you see that narrow

554
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,149
the homeless

555
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,730
answer is No that's what it is that you
only see

556
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm doesn't news and bad news I could
have drawn this house doing a lil bit

557
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,060
weird about it and

558
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,790
as they are about 400 possible months he
says are all from

559
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,560
black presentation from 2006 which
referenced something over translate I'm

560
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,220
not a valid there possibly four hundred
possible mines

561
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,750
a little I'm but they also found that
the top five months make up the loss of

562
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,960
the season by personal which

563
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,190
is long and even then the top 14 months
ago

564
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,450
nineties use and Xander 400 you really
really scary

565
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,310
well this is me if you know a handful
Mike I'll instructions

566
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:19,270
you can read the whole some I mean if
you can eat it for lunch in

567
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,600
without like encountering simple you
might not know as you can tell I hope it

568
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,429
works you can read about that other
construction &

569
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,830
I hit me is pretty easy to understand as

570
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,169
a blast at a council meeting as I think
it perfectly illustrates that is he

571
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,740
really is

572
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,930
so here's a basic instruction there are
only four five six seven

573
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,500
here and he's all his about 45 seconds

574
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,190
ish I'm and that's because i think im
anything wrong

575
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,360
baby is entire thing and was injected

576
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,949
here right I'll those bitchy

577
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,100
yeah them as you know yeah home

578
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,379
yet for investors are now I guess on

579
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,760
so almost follow these instructions you
that would be the

580
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,380
that removes all this evening is like it
comes

581
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,000
on the example we'll talk about that I'm
is in fact that we're using Intel

582
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,969
the first alright as the destination

583
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,250
the settings so here he had 703

584
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,300
it would take three added 27 and store
the result

585
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,139
in whatever the first operand West so it
need 10

586
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,490
in the rest up with your destination
subtract recent end or X or not

587
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,819
there it was operations and you have to
do know that was operations

588
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,490
you know they do exactly what they like
to do I

589
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,618
remove which killed me every like taking
office line has moved

590
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,300
leave the populace cotton I'm just feel
that the only name but it's kinda funny

591
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
that's the most complex name one year

592
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,710
I'm and this is kinda the room

593
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,320
like this and you know I liked it for us
isolated luv

594
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,010
reasons I was because you can see line
and even if it looks really good places

595
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,140
there were a lot of them

596
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,190
you busy 11 noted like it was pretty

597
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,210
there's a lot of lines and I'm

598
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,430
just cool so a small

599
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:17,470
on is that code I was all wrong what a
fucking nap in SF next after that

600
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,368
and the real girl doesn't homework if
these

601
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,810
have things like yeltsin's phones and
what where we have control

602
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,420
loan modification as him singing this
only on

603
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,710
one thing if you love programming other
languages immunity issue

604
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,490
and that is the fact that like did he
goes around

605
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,560
line is a chance I shall you write
anything is empty without

606
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,520
launchers yes are you and there is no

607
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,319
there's a lot of a little for a while a
view that

608
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:51,210
like this by using comparisons pounds of
muscle is now

609
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,079
181 know the terms mean and

610
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,790

historical

628
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:09,650
the previous arithmetic instructions
arab-americans

629
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,790

630
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,000
is a bit that he wanted to in these you
that is high

631
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,599
01 if the last arithmetic operation and
resolve the issue

632
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,770

635
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,029
percent ones' on the operation will
result in a medium

636
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,890
I'm so I having this information
