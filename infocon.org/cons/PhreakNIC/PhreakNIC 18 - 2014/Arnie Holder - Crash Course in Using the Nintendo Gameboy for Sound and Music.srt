Long Island's early now thanks

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,680
moment

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,310
where special

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,500

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,990
I have all this them image

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,700
sorry time

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,130
original GameBoy the NGO was really

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,760
able man's name

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,860
as a

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,589
z80 CPU with in a great second
generation

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,460
stereo now which signage

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,560
main no worries

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,780
saying or

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,979
Sam you lease or to square one
generators

18
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,990
wanted usually one PC imported

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,850
way to channel which the

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,908
name for itself was on hand

21
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,039
since bill is orchard

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,119
on as the emblem

23
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,730
card

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,560
want more reason to should register more

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,060
and the Council sale

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,350
has on him

27
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,000
has never really been in use

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,280
although you Travis here

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,409
important explored

30
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,140
so it wasn't until 1998 there were
commercial

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,290
for you cent

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,210
the game with him

33
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,550
it had a simple 16 step sequencer
poultry gauge

34
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,400
that although it wasn't very useful

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,170
song position in the you access very

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,250
the hardware chain I'll square ways and

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,829
string so it was it was really
interesting

38
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:35,939
yes experiment who went you want we're

39
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,370
while really

40
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,760
1

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,640
next thing all

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,540
in 2002 pop music this was actually

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,900
old did

44
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,700
US is all or harbors and channels

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,530
Paul's wife

46
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,000
mornings and bill TN

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,250
pretty more slash

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,060
samples low-balling samples

49
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,190
okie terms harbors Center

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,700
I very mall

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,079
and I'll not so great is a single step
sequencer

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,599
I'm the alright this 0

53
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,910
%um over there that is example watson's

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:43,900
these so many work for you

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,090
so you know I actually going back when
the home routers guy

56
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,370
all name

57
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,920
workers say more sequence or

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,980
in DC raunchy song

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,440
and yonghong pollens

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,710
little Sammy J or protractor of a man

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,170
drew's all these

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,010
more no pretty close together

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,789
lane I'm there was another at the same
time

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,780
that

65
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,698
Bell didn't last very long all reeling

66
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,599
and it was a lot more demo who went

67
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,469
personal song

68
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,370
home software a usually

69
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,550
whose dot GB model which this

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,160
someone to do something wrong so all

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,900
home position low-grade glioma

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,109
are engine plane independently

73
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,170
it is used for

74
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,529
backing

75
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,650
people saying

76
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:06,710
game production

77
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,270
so personal problems now likenesses
assistance through

78
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,150
sequencer it was it still is

79
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,630
release home custom cartridge hardware

80
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,819
and asthma

81
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,720
room

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,220
there's been several the tumor

83
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,890
years on different oranges there were
different

84
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,260
the oh you mean mention

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,710
on one person use

86
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,120
had a the chant square one

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,660
which actually generating arms in into
the game

88
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,280
or you

89
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,429
other things like

90
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,480
or so his policies on are

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,610
hardware

92
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,490
control

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:10,789
comes

94
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,889
while looks like this is the current
generation park

95
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,960
for using their

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,169
does the really the PCB everything

97
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,669
and him on wall RAM

98
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,169
that in there

99
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,689
or them

100
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:36,469
maximum stores

101
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,789
to all right there you see each
hard-working

102
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:41,310
isn't doing

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,569
is whale yes it seems there's instead
right here

104
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:53,400
thanks to me

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
will send DJ

106
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,150
is well

107
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,979
which has along play or

108
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:11,008
which useful Flickr art

109
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,800
ones that are available today have USB
implicitly

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,020
our pleasure buildings now I'm all

111
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,630
Graham am

112
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,009

South well rating really

114
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,639
slurs

115
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,210
I like this it is a pro drinkers

116
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,758
I'll 32 your place employees you can
load

117
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,720
customizing range I already am

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,830
yes or software anything

119
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,430
another the travails

120
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,160
NJ

121
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,060
cynicism which a hardware

125
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,508
since I was waiting strictly in

126
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,139
wage so this is Lyle

127
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,489
stupid dollars this is the

128
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:16,869
overview

129
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,090
see each use polymers in the hardware
chain all

130
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,669
wobbles who way

131
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,210
00 Tyler their long

132
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,840

133
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,930
romance this is what

134
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,479
used in the end this is what's contained
in that phrase

135
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,570
these and I'm that particular phrase

136
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,820
name in against women on there so you
don't want to

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,990
using the Banu me

and recreation

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,290
so platforms a great forward Louis Park

140
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,339
and

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,830
getting overs one so union leaders

142
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,240
other available pretty much plant

143
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,500
think the GV being

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Miami later choice they along

145
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,350
pretty much everything that the only

146
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,360

thing names

150
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,849
here's a something the current

151
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,180
generation lifeguard mom right

152
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,640
is the news winds

153
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,370
strenuously and we'll me

154
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,060
software at all just words like plans
for the whole

155
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,369
trembling informing this is the previous
generation

156
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,680
I it's also use the thank you and

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,689
flash program I

158
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,470
has not been there since where next so
it's very hard to

159
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,010
using will

160
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,980
enhances for me

on

163
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,329
so

164
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,319
switch over

165
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:53,240
this is BG

166
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,379
this is just a game-winning later

167
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,800
lonely in exactly the same

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,050
piled low on your flash more

169
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:16,969
yeah

170
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,390
okay

171
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,590
your meal show you the
