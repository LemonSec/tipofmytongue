71
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,590
little in a single slowing down and

72
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,099
busy all be an issue way is going down
to mash

73
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,340
the singles call a.m. Singh so

74
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,909
the frequency we're broadcasting on
think between

75
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,000
to be not but for like 96.5

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,300
never the 90 and

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,510
the as you do that information said miss
so that you raised

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,650
hours ago I low I'm

79
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,820
wanna low than what's owed actually

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,550
this minor and on the other side this
fall

81
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,770
populist pretty much so this

82
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,289
powers constant so when there is steady
stream Anne

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,979
bear actually of ways the like to start
everyone seemed to the actual

84
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,729
well with the champ taking changed

85
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,479
but thats can only know like that at all

86
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,620
you can understand that %um

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,789
more than night it was feels better

88
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,068
is just this so this

89
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:57,139
right here very top 10s 0 ours

90
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,139

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,589
all all the way down to you three
hundred years

92
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:07,659
is what the top is from the government
regiments

93
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,969

110
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,669
this is a blow her mind of

111
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,830
so hearst network movie news

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,169

the year two thousand

113
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,219
I'm so lonesome dove noon I really
wasn't

114
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,479
do chance these

115
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,810
news channel know it's starting at 1:51

116
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,870
generics pillars

117
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,820
that and so on these others and

118
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,240
up you know readout okay

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
so these two channels you noticed her
like twice a day

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
these are all over there are men

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
absolutely house so

122
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,179
as they like your home and others you're
speaking on FB

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,599
no search so this is a quality

124
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,210
25 ship slightly wider given

125
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,940
radio in issue the where the 2002

126
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,169
you water forced information was sounds
better

127
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,599
when it gets worse so in particular
these two channels not bring up

128
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,300
to the user with the nation office

129
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,930
this I

130
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,900
I had no idea good

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,370
David Sunday cleanup ended

132
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,659
Ramones the radio systems so many of

133
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:46,430
I'm this

134
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,269
it is he's pretty sure a lot of that
song and i miss u

135
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,769
loss are and the uninsured and yet

136
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,250
our 40 all or twenty hard

137
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,489
20

138
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,159
so word

139
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,819
where are the only currently in the
United States of America

140
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:10,519
and 2014 this year

141
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,209
in June it's nice to come to camp but at
the last minute

142
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,238
no we don't need to do that

143
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,319
but not till and in Augusta

144
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,659
this is a lot more and happily
definitely

145
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:28,119
but really think about is you can really
use it anywhere

146
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:32,269
because it is only too while beautiful
range is only about 10

147
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,669
and given everything that's on

148
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,499
there's nothing in there spectra
currently where

149
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:43,279
do not like this secured

150
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
I notice some when I'm standing

151
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,959
missus certain people ready and and
reward

152
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,350
here

153
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,040
so billion burgers everyone you

154
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,400
get licensed free anyone can use it

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,810
you only only a few surgeons based on
the closing

156
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,390
for the you don't need petty Washington
ago so

157
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,670
into other privileged

158
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,040
so it's really awesome

159
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,670
you can use it knows out you

160
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,089
murder their couple easy ways to get
started

161
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,930
there are model the world for me

162
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,270
model believe so and it allows word

163
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,750
anyway so much and yeah season

164
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,650
there is a rate Mohamed you know

165
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,310
him think for is not legally allowed in
her

166
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,540
portrayed but asian teen pregnancies

167
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,209
and

168
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,640
you're not of

169
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,430
then that lives within its as you
mentioned history of protesters

170
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,140
I'll if you wanna be

171

lot like benji radios the gym channel

213
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,430
happy

214
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,989

problems singles online

215
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,370
where they use that these are problems
that need to be separated

216
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,670
all the next you're not allowed printer

217
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,910
so anyone with anytime and start
listening in on

218
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,959
on so much talking to other radio

219
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,070
up radio probably not good

220
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,380
used know everything about

221
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,820
a murders is its low your master

222
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,920
loss but the spectrum there

223
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,260
there in the future way thousands of
here

224
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,470
last year round so

225
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,640
unlikely what matters is just a few
hundred you can actually get

226
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,770
wanna the other good

227
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,840
for a so

228
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,290
organization murder everyone few rules
they have

229
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,410
but

230
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,280
if you haven't we put our on here home
your best

231
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,980
its I would expect just so while

232
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,010
house you dont now

233
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,090
stage

234
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,720
um

235
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,350
I when they have liked about this so or
versus not under

236
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,660
because really fractures targeted

237
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,150
so much like the Motorola and two other

238
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,620
radio I know they're actually for for
you

239
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,870
every one of those numbers because the
damn

240
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,640

day you printable nothing

244
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:40,269
so as long as everybody's units are used

245
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,279
the other hand allows data some of the
other

246
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,620
says and then don't allow data and

247
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,620
