1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,210
okay so thanks for coming here also

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,410
and Senate night really awesome

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,630
anybody showed home me

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,780
season I'm so

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,090
I'm talking about

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,050
free and open source software which is a
pretty while

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,090
insolvent try to discuss but

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,210
mostly I just might seem yessir slightly
technical

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,740
not very techincal overview how you can
get your foot in the door

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,170
to contributing to what I consider to be
soon flagship

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,690
free open-source I S the latest kernel

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,890
and Firefox browser

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,630
so reason I want you to stop also is
that

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,960
when I was first trying to involved in
open source

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,420
and you know it but the idea its
immediate past your mailing list

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,059
a or are trying to work on a big project
that was

17
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,540
just some persons I on Sprint

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,120
really intimidating you know coach cell

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,479
hopefully is toppled

20
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,940
may be easier for supplying online see
involved

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,090
these projects about me

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,310
using my game i right clicking on the
links

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,780
no which is my slightly embarrassing

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,369
microplane name I work at Mozilla

25
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,790
non-police issue so download Firefox

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,030
that's my team that get all build it
they will come here's

27
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,270
all that nice to house electro state

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,580
military is happening in national right
its GMC should check out

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,179
me and I don't mean increased my text

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,630
which you're gonna see over him

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,190
you yeah as Lady Gaga

32
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,360
and she is making a funny face and the
law for talking about myself so I

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,440
figured it was

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,700
Apple so

35
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,479
we'll be talking about for you to the
source software that using I'll say all

36
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,300
impacted

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,720
announced now all they say boss

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,930
signed at great cost yet is for free

39
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,390
Richard Stallman twice is a free for you

40
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,029
not freezing here that he indeed 3 as in

41
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,630
here he said she's the idea is that

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,750
if users don't have control over this
offer is going on their computer

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,080
then the software has controlled which
is

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,910
I guess today is the right thing to say
Los he reminded people here

45
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,959
sure I'm sure you can you can live with
that

46
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,110
waiting OS

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,000
opens doors so there's a subtle
difference between free and open source

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,290
I think a lot of people don't see

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,650
which song is very these things that
bother

50
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,050
resource yesterday reno stores open
source means that

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,620
the source code is out there remain look
at but here's the trick

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,350
did Microsoft made when does it mean
internal

53
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,010
published so that

54
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,929
is you get really wet and cold you make
some changes

55
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,970
less babe giving you the freedom to
share those changes

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,510
is offering a if you think some older
building but

57
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,349
is against the law you publish it was I
think that's the

58
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,760
practical aspect and three 30 schoolers

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,099
and so another thing about open source
software development is that is very

60
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:41,869
different

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,079
from behind

62
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,959
top-down development that companies

63
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,130
would have done in the past

64
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,470
well still knew someone is little bit RK
these days I think I think most big

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,550
companies are

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,040
taking this order open source type

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,500
methodology to heart with with
developing the software projects that

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,610
there is already closed doors model that
s

69
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,730
very top down and there's this bizarre
on a lot of people are going off

70
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,700
and forming little groups are going off
in a corner and building features and

71
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,789
presenting them to each other and trying
to

72
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,040
former world and patches homies nathan
is our motto

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,180
i'm looking and

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,400
children

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,650
no Hao Wei

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,090
this is my computer

77
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,510
yeah no

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,640
okay so

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,050
you should read this book interested in
history reno somewhere and it be known

80
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,860
that was our

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,980
services and will lovely now

82
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,990
good it's still interesting here's a
video

83
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,110
explain the differences between free
open-source

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,140
straight from that people who

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
really started

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,240
themselves but I'm not gonna show that
as

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,850
I'm not sure I'm actually gonna have
time to waste

88
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,910
minutes but you can look at it later

89
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,500
between the sides so a lot of people
like to say that

90
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,060
open sources eating the world software
is

91
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,150
not as it's true most big companies
these days have realized that

92
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,940
they should open source their projects
and has become very commonplace

93
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,690
see that I would argue is on injured my
hand right

94
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,510
you that you can't today being a
marginal business community is a

95
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,000
political statement and I find healing

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,590
as partners mind game ball with
computers in the first place is because

97
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,840
I thought mister

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,929
radical and is the idea doing being

99
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,980
and the collected and doing things
andrew is a

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,630
share your knowledge as hosting our
individuals

101
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,630
and making one cash although

102
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,610
you can make lives in cash to Greg

103
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm I can stay

104
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,170
his lasting Greg kroah-hartman he is

105
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,530
coming to be here nice you actually as
the maintainer

106
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,469
staging range experts these the big deal

107
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,290
and he was giving talking he says by
this time

108
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,440
a person has contributed by patches the
Linux kernel they're doing it

109
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,680
just for fun don't have a job where

110
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,300
nice no by that guarantees it

111
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,470
and I think that rings true

112
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,700
in my home I Anna I think about six
months ago

113
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,620
I open source server website server

114
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,320
convoluted mess building for fun I put a

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,849
on on pipelines package manager

116
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,410
and in companies engineering managers at
companies

117
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,660
so my project because they want to use
it and I was skip to the end and

118
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,580
budgeting

119
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,210
process that usually very and so

120
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,930
that was pretty interesting to see that
country because I was the stuff in the

121
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,770
past like

122
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,810
what group page that area

123
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,370
think yeah I if you went to Princeton or
steamers

124
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,030
thing but no is to bring I went to West
End years

125
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,559
they don't care if you work on
open-source will do well

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,900
and so in hand why doesn't every single

127
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,450
hers go and trying to use you open
source projects

128
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,580
we all know that a No and I

129
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,370
thing that's the point disheartening is
that

130
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,070
I think a lot of people do you want to
do you like the idea of it

131
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,080
but they just don't know how to get
started where they try to get started

132
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,599
somebody's injured or are they try to
patch

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,690
it's rejected they don't understand why
and actually there's thirty

134
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,290
I don't know if you can CVS you seems
like

135
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,490
somebody collected

136
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,080
%uh bunch studies actually where they
were looking at what's blocking people

137
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,020
from getting integrated in open source
projects

138
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,880
hands they clustered by a group that I'm
really interested in

139
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,110
three things I'm really interested in
fact that a lot of people found it

140
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,820
difficult or impossible to find or they
found it difficult or impossible to set

141
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,090
up

142
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,530
their work environment so they can even
know how to go about

143
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,000
creating and did and sending selling it
to somebody

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
for %um and people have a lot of
problems

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,930
finding bugs to work which I mean think
about it

146
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,920
your kid in university in thing

147
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,240
did a so we'll talk about that event but
it is

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,180
you work on software projects its own
text write

149
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,260
so you have a source file and make some
changes to it

150
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,950
at something or change the name is
something online

151
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,190
did is just another text file that his
only to change

152
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,270
made so you can't stand that that text
last month feels like a model

153
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,699
program called hatcher they can use
version control program

154
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,380
make like that and it will make

155
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,780
their home base like years making added
really well

156
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,410
so that they can here and I sorta

157
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,719
that's the unit and that's offered all
is measured

158
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,079
is instead he

159
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,248
that's something I was gonna get to see
a nice line

160
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,429
think it's a real problem for people
trying to work on older projects

161
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:50,439
like fish

162
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:56,659
you on the bus as though and the last
thing is

163
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:00,729
I think that it's really hard for people
to find out

164
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:06,249
was the one to get involved in western
all okay great go fine as a bug in the

165
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:06,849
kernel

166
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:10,959
that she won X that and I know where to
look

167
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,618
cool so touching her mother just
discussing at schools in dade

168
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:21,089
getting involved in open source

169
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,279
as a few here is a prerequisite
knowledge that down

170
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,869
directly have bearing software
development and without those you're not

171
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:30,559
getting

172
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,889
are with them everything's gonna be so
much easier

173
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,169
you need to know about version control
systems so do this

174
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:44,059
no especially like it mercurial yunis
know about using IRC which he recalled

175
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:44,630
all time

176
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,480
education you gonna have to know and
I'll setting up email clients

177
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,210
to use plain text only which actually
requires a few hoops these days

178
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,500
everybody these days there is using
Gmail percent

179
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,470
play nice with textile mill in this so
gonna mercurial

180
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,410
I will talk about those little bit I
recommend

181
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,130
reading up on you spirit I'm I actually

182
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,840
will attach

183
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,080
my sources a really great 15 minute
tutorial

184
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,590
has argentines still learn about Yale

185
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,130
and then you're seeing what is it

186
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,930
in the context a text file and not for
by Sonya

187
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,500
I recommend actually generated

188
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,920
and then using tool called patch

189
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,930
using UNIX system and apply it with
patch and not with just thinking

190
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,890
get a feel for for what's happening I S
T cell

191
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,630
every open source project as an IRC
channel Merz channels

192
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,189
I spin every day all day

193
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,660
in IRC channels and sure enough
engineers wander in and not ask

194
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,540
questions

195
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,310
means my teammates will instant recall

196
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,599
really happy there

197
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,680
so yet if if you got to work on open
source project first thing you should do

198
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,699
you find out what

199
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,940
IRC channels its contributors I wouldn't
angle

200
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,500
compartment also you want to use I
received actively

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,670
you gotta use announcer or you something
like tires the

202
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,650
I'll and that's going to make it so that
you're never off line

203
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,260
and you can't have nice things like
histories that people talk to you on

204
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,939
your way

205
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,530
you'll be able to see the messages basic
features another job programs but

206
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,199
higher Seans is permitted on purpose

207
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,790
so using something like IRC cloud really
help

208
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,990
I see it this is very important

209
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,550
a lot of people especially

210
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,250
overzealous kids will guitars piano
start

211
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,200
running into rooms and opinions standing
in

212
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,930
with nonsense and people will be mean to
them

213
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,079
and they'll had a bad opinion a buyer's
the

214
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,960
from then on out and it will prevent
them from being involved in open source

215
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
projects I've seen this before

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,740
has time to okay had a linen shirt on

217
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,700
like all this so bowling shirt like how
can I get involved

218
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,330
in open source projects and I told him I
said well here

219
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,980
doing this I siege there's a grouping
developers in nashville here all the

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,460
time

221
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,350
no learn things he says people on IRC

222
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,290
hassles well there are no

223
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,240
now

224
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,970
him nerds candy at home standards to be
assholes

225
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,990
but I fine a lot of times this is just a
misunderstanding or

226
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm so do a little research don't just
running errands testing

227
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,989
unexpected people's to be your Google
also

228
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,050
don't ask to ask just asking questions

229
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,579
behaviors waiting on line act like
you're verbalizing

230
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,640
and impatient people people are busy
people or

231
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,800
are using it you know that bouncer the
IRC about it might

232
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,949
you might like are they're never gonna
see my messages unless they keep

233
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,720
standing

234
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,140
because you won't realize that there's a
history but

235
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,600
just be patient people get back to you

236
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,970
ace in communication so

237
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,320
you want your client to be set up for
playing text

238
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,019
that's very important you can deal with

239
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,790
singing hatch's now

240
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,530
so here's a link them saying that gmail

241
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,079
I recommend if you're going to be
sending in patches

242
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,700
mailing lists usually feature get again
playing on gets in

243
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,550
now its main just for this I mean course
get was made by

244
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,609
absurd for where the next though they
had this the gym for themselves

245
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,020
you can just have you just have to get

246
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,470
directly San with you did and people as
much simpler but you can also use my

247
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,340
I think much so the defacto standard me
in my email client it's all plain text

248
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,380
force if you have a gmail account I have
here to stay

249
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,620
that we're all taking your Gmail
credentials and said that meant for you

250
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,400
game learn about using my just by the

251
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,699
in your veins so now we get to you

252
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,750
I guess the fun part when we look at
actually

253
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,750
getting involved in these projects in
some small

254
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,180
hang first by Justin meeting about what
is that like

255
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,599
so none of these projects numbers

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,430
as Salaam worse zillions

257
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,609
it but also the Linux kernel tracks
thereabouts a

258
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,520
just sign up for an account is really
easy to use

259
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,890
when using web applications ranges to
sign up for an account

260
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,090
and then click new money you have about
maybe

261
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,220
I don't know maybe Firefox is crashing

262
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,370
%um think it's because it's not playing
well with your YouTube video driver

263
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,750
file it's really easy to do you thinking
about going to show you

264
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,520
all the different all the different
subsystems

265
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,160
or projects that there are issues from
choose one

266
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,040
menu select component you don't know
what component there's another category

267
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,849
and that will attach all the people who
are interested in a

268
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,850
to the email list and then you just
write a nice description

269
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,530
what your body needs to do that there
are a few

270
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,120
police here to you to documents that
will help you write the description but

271
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,270
too long don't read include screenshot
it became

272
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,829
mess always helpful even if you don't
think it would be just go ahead and do

273
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,260
it

274
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,420
home describe the steps to reproduce it

275
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,089
if you are noticing that your browser is
crashing

276
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,160
force it to crash anything

277
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,719
and document what she did to force it to
crashing super important

278
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,270
also search for duplicate bucks

279
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,970
somebody else is already filed only that
but don't do that

280
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,920
morning if you just right there no
description when you go to stand it will

281
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,550
find you can get loans and is blamed for
him

282
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,260
and also this is a great numbers like
that

283
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,540
if you see you next time system I don't
know about Windows spokesman using a

284
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,500
subsystem

285
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,559
maybe but at a pace a

286
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,569
uses Linux back means

287
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,680
use

288
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,560
fuck in nine starts in the emails to all

289
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,450
developers CC was K what about member
they work

290
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,030
don't do that just be patient and when
they do get back to you

291
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,370
try respondent today

292
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,709
but he's never sign up forget for a
proposal i cant

293
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,920
you click new and you

294
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,740
13 users to find the right team to bug
and then you

295
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,020
writers option that's be that's a huge
help

296
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,150
for open source huge well

297
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,700
now what if you're a developer

298
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,790
and don't lie just admit but FIGS now
let's talk about

299
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,060
hypothetical Hodgson's caveat being

300
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,149
this isn't in that at all this is just
minutes is already showing

301
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,990
with the workflow looks like demystify

302
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,340
step 0 when prime steaks

303
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,939
the first cash I stand thanks the
maintainer

304
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,960
subsystem

305
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,730
for a is for a webcam driver started his
email

306
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,850
ok ugh

307
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,668
your you're lumping a whole lot changes
together so what I've done minus

308
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,880
I made for the first mistake she came
with patch

309
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,340
good is I and takes a whole buncha

310
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,389
use them for years all I wanted

311
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,610
don't do that especially people who are
using

312
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,990
have a lot been really willingly I
filling

313
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,169
bill for large changes in the ointment

314
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,289
and forget about it that won't fly

315
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,820
in these projects one change

316
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,020
want and that is the one line text by
the way

317
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,399
just means like mornin want some peace.
concept

318
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,179
like

319
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,850
and changing the sleep time Muslim

320
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,639
nationalism step 1:

321
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,880
meet the guidelines that's why i
shouldn't

322
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,990
honestly they're not really typical
mostly they just say

323
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,270
writing message be an split all

324
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,320
changes and news it's very hard to be
good

325
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,970
it's too small better Spirit Airlines
flight actually

326
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,880
right maze

327
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,910
ID is also yes funny style guidelines

328
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,480
claims the user a space with

329
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,600
a space with cabs for one thing

330
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,928
basically the fall am is

331
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,630
is the way that that they prefer
everything

332
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,460
four-minute and which is really ugly an
archaic

333
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,150
especially weird think that they prefer

334
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,630
the line the with a limit to be a
characters

335
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,890
using it's the stabs items

336
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,260
but read the coding style document

337
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,680
and be sure to be there so

338
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,240
the first thing you know when to use a
gun I was going to take a long time

339
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,410
instantly positive 3 I mention that Greg
KH

340
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,140
is the maintainer staging range so that
you can find you

341
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,200
gonna do development honor home you know
and you to fill me in on the staging

342
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,700
dash

343
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,150
next bridge that's gonna live here you
can

344
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,420
look at room think Oklahoma

345
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,920
first thing I'd recommend you do in your
phone is it you never build the kernel

346
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,790
obviously

347
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,090
he wants me to pass you need to start
building colonels right away

348
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,649
so building kernel is actually really
trivial to do you

349
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,120
especially village near if you run into
you are you run

350
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,000
mint man

351
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,110
you're gonna want to actually building
that %um

352
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,270
and get him package and use

353
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,350
and then install the package

354
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,459
because there's some there's special
stuff that has to go into

355
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,150
to the kernel insofar as models then
we'll worry about that

356
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,510
if you just wanna remind doin' system

357
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,100
p.m. don't mean anything to you modules
just

358
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,340
come source 3 copy over your old

359
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,709
kernel configuration and make

360
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,320
make installment update really easy
there

361
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,260
does here okay

362
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,450
so now you got your kernel know that's
working back into the source tree

363
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,890
check out the staging dash experienced
rain

364
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,380
well against begins ads and check out

365
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,230
dash be that create your own new branch
times that you can make some changes

366
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,330
do similar one place to

367
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,659
to start ensure that you will be using
money wayne's

368
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,200
with just looking at source file Center
Rd imagery

369
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,530
in china fine style years there's a
winter that ships

370
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,250
scripts directory unmixed I'm first
means

371
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,280
just pointed out the source files him

372
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,530
I'll there's a and you mine Union file

373
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,030
when there's a space

374
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,980
should be removed CD that make

375
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,490
hatch months and the or do anything

376
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,030
rebuild there was a really great

377
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,070
wasn't right usually or

378
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,178
there was a

379
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,750
horrible tirade against them 18-19 year
old kid

380
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,059
from Europe who exhibited about a dozen

381
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,980
patches terminals that must pledge bro

382
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,420
the current China building he been
making patches

383
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,420
let not feeling the contested

384
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,380
baby in you on the mailing list and
wonderful maintainers likely

385
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,760
was the villages because he wasn't
joking said that he Jesus

386
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,170
yeah

387
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,160
we all okay he said his kidney diseases

388
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,910
his kidneys he had some series emotional
problems

389
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,929
all yeah I didn't link to that but

390
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,940
you just can't point

391
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,730
that so it the current deals

392
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,470
nobody's gonna sleep Jesus government
committee

393
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,550
she could have done this before I just
want the extra States

394
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,879
doing million can happen billion mayor

395
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,990
hedge and be sure to add a nice

396
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,590
title here

397
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,320
a very descriptive body and in the
bottom it's very important that this

398
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,040
sign up by actually get up

399
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,960
him lol

400
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,679
yeah

401
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,410
me more

402
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,310
Graham or said the way

403
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,750
I'll

404
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,360
the Pacers our testers it's because

405
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,510
its is because the Linux kernel is

406
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,110
colonel my own code is

407
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,300
directly speaking to hardware and so

408
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,000
how can you test that except by mmm

409
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,420
not

410
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,070
the in you but then you're still just
making sure that it builds

411
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,520
at that point

412
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,110
that's true for

413
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,689
over

414
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,899
them pot of gold

415
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:10,928
PE developing

416
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,190
they girl more and a half dozen other

417
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,720
yet bed actually me

418
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,129
mile yeah id

419
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:25,738
word you and

420
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:30,149
Hills their

421
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:33,840
belittled there

422
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,449
they deduce that noses you want

423
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,950
Friday that well yeah

424
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,210
UK yeah

425
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,600
you can you can certainly do that no

426
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,260
its okay that's a good point I was very
shocked when I heard that as well

427
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,629
I think yet that's that's the way it
goes though I think

428
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,320
these guys are plugging in USB devices
on their desk im

429
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,830
works and that's what I did with that
video driver I had a wet

430
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,120
him then I'm here yes that driver good

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,909
or up

432
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,799
baby work using them

433
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,940
here

434
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,299
you know or yeah

435
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,210
he alright map

436
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,780
yeah are no need to Travis file yeah
yeah

437
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,580
all yeah by

438
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,320
more yeah

439
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,520
and there may be some stock I dunno I

440
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,780
I'm nothing an ingrained damaged

441
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,450
their lease a you know unit test as

442
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,320
but yes that that's a weird thing

443
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,480
per share help get is

444
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,580
special made for checking on development
with get

445
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,330
you have the dash yes

446
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,360
that's dash yes and Ashley E options

447
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,678
you turn those on when you commit and
you'll get always nice stuff like signed

448
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,390
off by

449
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,960
that the kernel sports successfully

450
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,210
and the last thing you do that you
committed your patch

451
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,380
is you just run another script that's in
the source tree

452
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,220
it's a prospect Kong and maintainer you
can

453
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,220
be clever and Heidi outfit get show head

454
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,919
or you can just play at the source file
you worked on it will just

455
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,029
for now and listen all the email
addresses

456
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,080
%uh maintainers who would be concerned
about that

457
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,799
I'll you get that list and how saying
surely so that's it

458
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,960
gets and mouse his way to do it hands

459
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,100
you that their email address and she
gets in the mail

460
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,428
in of value hatch injures watch

461
00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:02,429
you were even home for a message that
starts with the

462
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,909
sorry with your question but I would
recommend she do that

463
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,240
don't just don't rise patch

464
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,340
exam style your hair like in instead

465
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,679
I recommend you tried in this challenge
this

466
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,140
is maintained by people from Linux
Foundation likely

467
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,480
it actually works line in this challenge

468
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,980
you will be getting min towards word in

469
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,590
getting patches in the kernel source
tree you work through these challenges

470
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,669
and you will get patches into the links

471
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,650
you will see track teams placing

472
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,970
get long

473
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,850
ok

474
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:51,010
so that's it I went to the searchers
about that because my point was

475
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,179
and hopefully this point is look at it
passes that Carnival is not a the

476
