good your honor as other things that are
happening

18
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,489
in space community all good recalls

19
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,039
%um this is the first three and is

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,020

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,880
and I was checking out one day I

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,600
list chaos so recall and

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,479
there was a huge line and in jail and it
wasn't moving

30
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,789
and finally the Manchu I'll rather eerie

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,940
I'll walk over with is checking out boss
and

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,830
hood and set-in check Yahoo cash home

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,298
but if you have to have show credit card
can check you out

34
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,880
unless all it's a local and

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,449
out of all the people here are news
stories cash had enough cash

36

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,480
every way and he said well are he said
stay

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,709
and you know I was a mess up here

39
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,830
23 years on principle that here on a
mission as well last solar sails

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,470
naturally in three years I think I'm a
little nervous

41
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,580
face as when you were a and lack of
morals or sailing

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,660
but I said well what do you mean and he
said well you or credit card

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,200
and television actor haitians your
satellite

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,250
because I love slow unisons

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,390
your small or obscure yet stores

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,190
today gonna so they use secure

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,200
same way

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,238
do you dread tuner his

49
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,200
verify all that Anderson Wetlands Day
and sledge

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,359
money and as well on this this is easily
go out any problem with it haha stores

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,349
way home and you'll see satellite dishes
on the top

52
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,230
Kroger you'll see it texaco that's not
so people

53
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,799
West DirecTV breakdrum thats or

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,300
the set community so I went home and
started looking into it

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,670
and I suddenly okay well those are
moments where I really do this

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,179
with an M why can't you downs sent via
where the hoes

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,380
really matter if we lose our sense

58
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,560
and that was a little bit was the head
as they got me thinking about how we

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,890
space a his when people say well as
space done for me I'm

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,988
visions talk today this space technology
is also for our condo

61
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,690
installed we have one we space that is
has easy

62
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,730
beyond our wildest dreams into your eyes
and you'll see why

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,590
is because all oh well I questions is a
burning question here only when we

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,750
and if you cannot wait for the end but I
don't

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,260
yet into yet yes so let you know when
you're going you're

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,489
and the first ever tell you this you can
watch news is we've been hearing about

67
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,549
this massive

68
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,109
solar flares farms size eighty

69
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,200
Earth's at least huge is just rotated to
be on the far side of the Sun

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,360
firms you see it like no and we don't
know who is doing

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,320
but we do know is enormously biggest
sunspots

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,849
in decades and fortunately has not been
doing something called

73
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,090
messenger across the St James was not
just realized his liver temperature

74
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,900
outside is it was actually is

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,560
hormones megastore the coronal mass
ejections

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,310
was on the matter the other whose son is
because you know souls

77
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,320
and is there is basically up last

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,940
protons electrons and trash and then if
you would

79
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,350
and it comes out as you watch the
original Star Trek

80
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,270
program closed ships up

81
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,700
for example he does is massive thing is
wrote everything about your rights as a

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,190
as an SQL

83
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,350
miss regularly and endure most of them
are very powerful

84
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,360
said what I said batten down the hatches
show has

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,240
with the share a special school the
effort also

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,230
actually where he is I'll protects let
rise the solar storms

87
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,930
they might get fried and this happens
fairly regularly

88
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,240
however in the 1850s

89
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,260
1859 it was a really really be

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,530
wrong message as a natural and real good
resizes

91
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,659
website he resigns as nineteenth century
right

92
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,020
word hearings and he was the team's
noses and

93
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,180
really really active use missiles go and
this was in the early days

94
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,240
%uh Telegraph writers a arms

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,970
war and telegraph were in England and
the United States

96
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,480
what happened was the solar storms wrong
message

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,170
it here it pushes are magnetic field and

98
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,710
were your and as many feel protests are
satellites

99
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,549
is well yes russian space station don't
have to worry about solar radiations

100
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,930
they're down below and well with you and
yours

101
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,190
maybe below the solar storms hit your

102
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,469
it compresses magnetic field here and
was true that

103
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,220
station way and its go so close to the
earth a changing magnetic field ross's

104
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,460
I this time Telegraph lines and started
inducing

105
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,070
race is this generate electricity is
changing menu

106
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,400
wire and Ashley possible arrest last
catch fire

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,250
number of poles tell arrest in the
batteries

108
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,830
our operators are going on the road and

109
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,880
deals were carrying those correlated the
solar activity what was happening on the

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,390
tram

111
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,760
all the good thing is we have said les
Snead because I saw missus onassis the

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,480
estimates are that happen today

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,590
lose most horses place right

114
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,799
a lot of the he's outlined damage

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,450
but a lot of people are going to survive
basically nuclear war

116
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,409
in space and sort of SLs probably mostly
be okay some ice

117
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,870
India we lose almost all installers
these

118
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,640
its and this we will be there seasons
dollars for

119
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,539
the good thing is says is basically the
end we handed

120
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,520
vessels the bad thing is we don't always
happen

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,590
it happened in 1859 are these events
that happened once every

122
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,210
thousand years every 500 use

123
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,830
every 150 years in case in which case do
you do for no

124
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,500
us all visitors lol I know

125
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,770
lol Sun sends out really massive

126
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,270
world

127
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,070
as shit which is no that's as we've been
in space

128
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,560
the Sun has been fairly benign and we
really haven't had

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,900
worry about it was the home there's
another problem because

130
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,310
losers place and this space debris
anybody

131
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,780
new space group okay well first

132
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,070
obvious that word Rio yes legal that run
through that again

133
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,560
be and we want to refer satellites in
nineteen sixties

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,590
basically what goes up case of satellite

135
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,750
the big boobs waiting arms lot

136
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,860
the Cheerios the nuts-and-bolts follow

137
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,020
%uh insulation Paul saw yes was moving
well all season the state space

138
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,240
a Lawler's is a passed through then

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,419
invalid you on your okay so even though
he

140
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,979
traveled a long term savings Davis your
cell

141
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,409
this so we launched is 41

142
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,569
russians lost but OK reserving

143
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,750
the thinking was in spaces Bay

144
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,420
him

145
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,939
series that was the thinking don't worry
that space is being gay

146
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,040
we had a long lunch instances in the
catalogue of cheese

147
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,819
greater than some years and I am them

148
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,820
my voice is really going to be pro has
grown dramatically

149
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,150
beam

150
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,140
and the problem is if you look at the

151
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm here long room is a so

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,210
with all there

153
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,029
I met with freshman talks or so with all
the space

154
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,080
John a them is still in my program

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,330
is there a way habla or something that

156
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,920
mean it's gone Pauline only injury
depends on the house

157
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,930
to it was below about 500 kilometers

158
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,029
love it is the atmosphere moves up nano

159
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,550
during the day have the answers fans and
play tracks

160
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,550
the Sun is active experience

161
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,029
and soul with Aspergers up their cause
09 e-mail

162
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:07,290
dread and will raise the money under
about 300 long as it pleases I'll

163
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,819
free will over a thousand kilometers
around you

164
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,890
to nearly 1000 years officially the
GOP's

165
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,500
you know because gramm

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,770
was rose one another cause it to go into
a you're more likely to know

167
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,939
but that's all like tens of thousands
use so

168
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,260
if you look at the numbers there are %uh

169
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,860
tens of thousands realizes that his and
yours and I am

170
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,340
Rourke the road through the and he had a
lot of times

171
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,460
which these are things we see on radio
or but they're less intense and use

172
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,900
size they don't wanna fall in prime
half-a-million

173
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,150
easily now there is a scientist

174
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,060
things that castle using the Johnson
Space before you retire

175
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,170
either the calculation at what point
there's so much debris up here

176
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,540
that he said like put up has a chance in
the hit and destroy his life

177
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,780
and that that's in the room where you
lost one

178
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,260
and get hit and the satellite is hit by
something moving it lowers the second

179
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,819
invasive reasons hundreds if not
thousands more reviews

180
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,870
school-age a runway chain reaction clear

181
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,350
are react okay and is it really does
every which way there's no priority word

182
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,930
for it

183
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,500
and so this is called kessler better
than his legs and

184
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,530
and we haven't reach that in

185
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,180
point yet we don't know when we will

186
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,380
but there will be a point that if we
keep putting his job got here

187
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,790
that we have run with 3:12 basically
destroying just about everything we have

188
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,719
and we're not to that

189
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,050
yet I US-japan your overall health

190
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,790
I'm to retaliation policies now is a
basic you want something you to minimize

191
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,779
the junk love with it and a spacecraft
into his life

192
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,220
has to reviewers atmosphere within 25
years

193
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,920
lindsey is low so basically was a rocket
fuel

194
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,459
and the satellites open it his mission
his shoes off yesterboard

195
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,149
is basically what that does but it's a
problem

196
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,500
this graph scares which you can see is
the growth

197
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,880
I think catalogue of shoes with time and
her starts back into a

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,279
with here for you so here that in the

199
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,610
was late 1960s and goes forward and
you'll notice there's

200
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,529
to big jobs that have one is called the
destruction thing and want to see

201
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,579
and one is the real 33 cosmos lose left
for slim

202
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,609
is a huge increase in the number Rios
cost like China

203
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,690
China's it you know we know the US in
the russians have the ability to not get

204
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,700
satellites

205
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,300
and US uses satellite technology very
extensively with his military

206
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,709
so we're going to tell us: by
demonstrating

207
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,029
that you're not invisible so they fell
into the role weather satellites that

208
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:11,930
was did

209
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,270
and they launched a mission missile and
space and blew up the problem is it was

210
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,360
in a high-altitude

211
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,810
so although the degree they've created
is going to remain

212
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,619
inward

213
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,780
okay now a few months later

214
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,079
people say I know about this well US bid
to

215
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,150
we love satellites show that we still
have the capability we only did we had

216
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,970
your mucho

217
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,090
ensure we can still do that we think
this I like it was a lower it was about

218
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,930
3 a.m.

219
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,589
so we would %uh all a joke and yes your
burn up

220
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,610
and did not increase the new repro okay

221
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,780
so that huge spike right here you busy
prior to that place is pretty much level

222
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,319
of

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,170
because country said realize we need to
do something about this

224
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,300
the hell did you know the next one was
an accidental collision

225
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,819
tonight went to set alight with a decir
by did russian satellite him really am

226
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,910
satellite not both up

227
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,880
and created a lot more memory that's
going to happen more and more of them

228
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,710
okay so this is a risk to our satellites

229
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:22,590
or space wars arrest what a lot of
people don't realize is that no space is

230
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,490
hard to get to

231
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,740
but their luxuries and access to space
man US

232
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,820
Russia China and Europe and Iran

233
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,630
okay they they present lives in space if
you can put a satellite in space

234
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,570
wanted to build ballistic missile to you
later satellite up

235
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,420
with ball bearings and Explosives and go
to region we know the other

236
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,219
countries have spy satellites and just
below to bring a path

237
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,530
and you conceivably though via Wednesday
said

238
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,670
doesn't have hit the target directly to
stay close the lottery in the past take

239
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,540
up for sale

240
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,160
solana space for his arrest

241
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,480
space nuclear wars have been released
that has fortunately not happened

242
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,269
I was actually planning for that during
the cold war days unfortunately never

243
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,769
happen those talks about what will
happen if we lose our satellites

244
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,019
those are three ways that we can
conceivably lose those Marcel

245
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,949
its was made you we have absolutely no
control over it

246
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:28,079
design one is basically just league's
basement with Nessa

247
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,729
control and the burden is intentional we
also

248
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,529
s control being a hacker's conference

249
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,949
I have a slider but in the end I should
have been to Israel emails

250
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:41,990
I wanna talk about it we have had
satellite act

251
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,839
okay one thing you need to know about
that was

252
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,660
international law I don't know all
policy policy

253
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,850
you have to US satellite considered an
actual

254
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,440
war okay so if a foreign government

255
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,010
and it can be traced to government
actually tax somebody else's satellite

256
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,510
by most countries policies that said

257
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,120
wall pay so is my understanding when the
heck happened

258
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,220
other domestic US outlying whoever the
hackers were

259
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,089
to show that they could get into the
system they didn't actually sending

260
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,190
commands

261
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,850
to this ad which was probably a really
good thing

262
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,300
okay just for lots of reasons but it has
happened

263
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,160
and yes has also not not a good thing

264
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,980
you think about what could happen
percent blowing you to meet at all

265
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,519
GPS goal or GPS right

266
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,879
I use GPS to find this hotel Days parade
going to my phone

267
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,480
and when Mike or well guess what
everybody loves so much will depend on

268
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,810
how many people know that right now is
essentially out of business

269
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,550
right man companies are gone GPS

270
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,128
is is used in so many ways and other
countries are opening up for a GPS

271
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,980
systems because they're afraid that US
funds for naw

272
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,620
GPS and you'll be stuck without it
russians opening up simple glonass

273
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,609
the europeans opening up the Galileo
system the Chinese were building their

274
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,000
own version GPS

275
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,890
because position tracking is not much
better well

276
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,309
let's talk about that within the next
few years

277
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,970
we're going away from around base
radio-controlled aircraft

278
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,250
in ruling was called NextGen air traffic
control

279
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,510
these all commercial flights

280
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,419
we use GPS for navigation not just

281
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,809
commercial airline flights freight CDC
the Memphis Airport

282
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,408
after midnight oh my gosh okay

283
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,559
FedEx her my life was sitting in the
back by the way of things like she's got

284
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,610
levels for sale that everybody's
interested

285
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,039
up we were we were looking at a midnight
to rule the FedEx Cup

286
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,169
it was incredible a takeover air traffic
control in Memphis

287
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,960
in the car at least are coming in from
all over the world paper shuffling

288
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
packages in that area

289
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,789
but air traffic control is going to be
done by Jim yes

290
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:11,080
medicines letters

291
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,889
use all the stuff was sent by FedEx is
about or soldiers for

292
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,690
air traffic eight thousand flights in
the year

293
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,950
at any given moment over North America
control my GPS is the next few years

294
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,269
trains are already there

295
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,480
there was a tragic accident about ten
years ago

296
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,539
work you train your freight train
several people die

297
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,730
congress in this Dave Communications Inc
internet and everything else should

298
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,740
am so it has laws that we needed

299
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,120
have better control knowledge were all
trains are on the nation's strange

300
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,760
grid and they went positive train
control salty

301
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,490
yes so when you're in the trains you may
have to make people driving them

302
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,720
but they're keeping track of where
everything is at all rate last summer

303
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,990
collisions and a traffic is flowing
smoothly

304
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,389
cousin transponders on all along and
everybody knows everybody else is

305
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,219
located

306
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,120
all be in control by GPS now first
glance you wouldn't think

307
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,678
than other than losing Google Maps for
Apple maps

308
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,769
you use that on your phone that you be
affected by the loss

309
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:19,389
GPS result well in order to Ralph your
call

310
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:23,459
or your internets or through Verizon's
network

311
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,179
or AT&T's network you have all those
packets today

312
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,860
so those packets of data are very
precise

313
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,580
position and time stance

314
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,529
closings and in order to wrap this data
is networks as efficiently as they do

315
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:44,679
the timestamps vitally important turns
out

316
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,340
all the cell phone towers use GPS

317
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,570
to have a common clock so they can
efficiently route to data from your

318
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,460
phone's

319
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,070
anywhere in the world you lose GPS

320
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,740
you lose your comment I'm staying

321
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,320
and cellphone network may or may not
function

322
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,439
at all along very well massive

323
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,049
crawl if we lose GPS GPS was originally
developed for the military

324
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,330
right smartphones are truths know where
they need to be

325
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,710
go back and look at the goal more I want
in high school for the civilian space

326
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,770
agency but we sure released a

327
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,840
with the US Army Missile Command
Redstone Arsenal

328
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,230
the first Gulf War way back in the 90's

329
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,970
was called first space because our
troops

330
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,320
exactly where they were any other guys
didn't

331
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,379
we were using GPS guided munitions

332
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,419
GPS mister ships was used to help
navigate

333
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,830
flames issues today with drones is
indispensable to work here

334
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,309
there's free GPS bottom purple right

335
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,928
so it's incredible for them for the army

336
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,220
for the navy up we have a bunch of folks

337
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,440
who are in the Navy to be active duty
military here

338
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,789
recent military well when I

339
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,970
is my understanding talking to some
colleagues that are in the Navy the

340
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,480
ships at sea now basically they can you
get ready

341
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,750
almost everything those GPS navigation
and it's not just

342
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,169
military ships is all those cargo ships
to carry goods from country to country

343
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,200
to carry our food from country to
country

344
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,270
OMG

345
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,450
yes have you one other things that
skiing

346
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,500
peace ukraine we're able to see right
now

347
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,840
what russia's military is doing on the
war review

348
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,879
grain because by cell lines spy
satellite

349
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,040
probably prevented World War three
during the Cold War

350
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,290
you do you know if someone is attacking
you

351
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,530
the instant they do it you see a
military build-up before they do it

352
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,850
just for keeping the peace spy cell
lines

353
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,689
is a space technology we will have a
great game

354
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,230
from some some the events I mention you
might call

355
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,220
pretty scary world situation I'm not
want to be in the modern world

356
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,940
with all the bad guys healthier and lose
the capability and looking down and

357
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,010
seeing what everybody's

358
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,629
or satellite phones needless to say

359
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,390
those are gonna go if you lose your
satellites I mention be says

360
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,820
at the beginning to bite off well
baseball

361
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,600
very small aperture terminals are
everywhere and the hell do more than

362
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,230
just check your credit cards

363
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,240
and your telecheck turns out

364
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,720
this summer the biggest companies in the
world due to inventory management

365
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,200
do your financial transactions keep
their books and transfer encrypt the

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,770
data

367
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:51,710
through the says by satellite there are
banks now

368
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,820
do interbank fund transfers and you
currency trading

369
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,960
at night for any time of the day

370
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,560
by satellite communication you know
money is no longer Peyton Manning is no

371
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,580
longer goals

372
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,090
visenteno right I guess bitcoins

373
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,889
yours right if you look at all the money
was transferred among the films are

374
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,620
banks

375
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,479
although my satellite transmission you
we tend to take for granted accurate

376
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,740
weather forecasts

377
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,700
hurricanes in the book I talk a little
bit about the difference between a

378
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,220
hurricane in galveston

379
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,060
in 1906 and one hit less than a decade
ago

380
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,510
about 6,000 people dead horses a couple

381
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,710
or none because people knew exactly
where to evacuate

382
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,630
where the Hurricanes going you can tell
people when is headed for Galveston you

383
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,330
don't need to evacuate New Orleans

384
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,530
you save hundreds of millions of dollars
in saving lives

385
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,440
for macular weather forecast we can do
that without cell lines

386
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,830
they save lives and money

387
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,330
human spaceflight needless to say I'm a
big proponent going to space

388
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,389
what an awful thing would be if we just
got word

389
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,550
we can't get out right

390
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,700
Jersey wolly right and that's that

391
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,650
does not talking about that's that could
be like that if we don't do something

392
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,440
about stopping

393
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,860
there's a little debris also want to
mention remote sensing

394
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,179
countries all over the world nail

395
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,010
you satellite data to locate resources
for industry

396
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,150
you can actually from space determines
your microwave radiometry

397
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,920
passive microwave emissions up his loyal
how much moisture

398
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,920
andrews's soil so you can predict where
there's going to be drowned you can tell

399
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,900
farmers

400
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,200
win the optimum time to plant their
crops or and in the end in places like

401
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
Mexico when they have these

402
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,840
tropical storms they're actually able to
predict where the landslide

403
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,169
gonna happen from passive ulcerations
soil moisture from space

404
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,240
long countries now are dependent on this

405
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,010
saves a lot of money in a lot of effort
but looking down from space

406
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,950
communications

407
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,990
if we had lost satellites and these
other things go Damn

408
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,760
people who want to know what's happening
they won't find out

409
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,930
came in television

410
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,730
doesn't go from the broadcast from
through cable to your home

411
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,650
comes of geosynchronous satellite lose
satellites

412
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,180
you lose communication the satellite
feeds these days

413
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,340
our automated for the most part and

414
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,870
global in nature so almost all over
communications

415
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:41,870
would be damaged one that a lot of
people don't think about but is vital

416
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,250
for commerce

417
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,180
is just in time manufacturing the only
way you can do just in time

418
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,130
manufacturing

419
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,310
is if you know exactly when the parts
you need

420
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,550
to build whatever it is you're building
your gonna come through the door

421
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,470
well how they manage their will they
know

422
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,710
what they be they transmit the data
typically for a system that relies on a

423
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,350
cell like

424
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,959
word comes from put on trucks navigate
by GPS

425
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,890
and are tracked by the company so they
know where they are in the supply chain

426
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,730
to get to you or you have to make in
which it depends on these parts

427
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,970
that has to come in the door with and
Alyssa when you need it for you

428
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,520
in fact all that would be damage and not
usable

429
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,790
with losses satellites in particular
with the Los a GPS

430
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,149
New York City

431
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,820
three days away from fam to go in New
York

432
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,780
night the cars to replace buy food drops

433
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,700
bringing in supplies to the groceries to
the coop

434
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,990
to the to the restaurant's cars go away

435
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,900
trucks come in this food all navigate
and manage

436
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,990
through the senate Majority control GPS
navigation

437
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:02,420
all depended on that infrastructure and
this is Charlie Chan I want you I will

438
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,090
say was an enormous at like this

439
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,250
cool picture but there there have been
set alight stack

440
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,880
and I would suspect a certain
three-letter organizations know how to

441
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
hack other people satellites that I
would only be speculating at that point

442
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,190
so what I want to leave you with and
I'll take questions

443
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:23,500
is this space technology is great

444
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,550
I'm a big advocate of I'm so glad that
we're finding all these innovative uses

445
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:32,060
for it but as of now no one is talking
also kinda scares me

446
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,220
because we have made are still dependent

447
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,770
on a very fragile infrastructure that's
just over its

448
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,360
in an environment that we think is safe
because I love the region's most people

449
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,560
but we're doing things to put in danger

450
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,050
and as more and more people have access
to space

451
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,530
they can willfully with this
infrastructure in

452
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,210
danger if I were asked what would be the
impact to the hearings in a minute

453
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,930
even if it didn't affect a systems on
the ground and just affected

454
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,410
commercial satellites my answer would be
no.

455
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,950
minimum we would have a depression
because of the effect on commerce and

456
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,770
industry

457
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,040
and the financial industry and financial
transactions you will not be able to

458
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,760
efficiently have bread on the shelves at
the grocery store

459
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,410
you will be able to conduct credit card
transactions can you imagine having

460
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,150
overnight go to cash only

461
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,230
alright thanks can transfer funds

462
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,310
truck drivers in trucking is is is
pretty much a standstill

463
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,700
commercial aviation stops because the G
the navigation system is out

464
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,790
the ships at sea which rely on GPS
tracking application

465
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,730
are now in officially going from place
to place and minimalism

466
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,330
rush at worst case I think a lot of
people would die

467
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,120
because at the breakdown of the
infrastructure particularly the food

468
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,530
and medicines infrastructure my daughter
is a type 1 diabetic

469
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,850
her insulin is made in Europe

470
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,040
and comes to the US by air travel and
here comes

471
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,850
alright I stock up about a three month
supply of insulin

472
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,959
do we think if we lost our satellites
would have the infrastructure back up

473
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,200
within three months

474
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,840
I doubt it okay so this could be a very
real threat

475
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,780
not just some abstract threat and so
what I'm I'm very pleased to report is

476
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,389
that

477
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,570
the orbital debris problem is being
addressed by most countries in the world

478
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:26,990
now

479
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,130
not all I most particularly not China

480
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,200
has not signed up told you was addressed
to the world has to women

481
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,779
little regroup problem no nation is yet
actively

482
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,500
removing debris to try to get this at me
and he's a chunk out of orbit

483
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,779
too expensive it would be considered in
unfunded mandate

484
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:55,880
if you're nasa or the European Space
Agency or even the Department of Defense

485
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,010
and I come up in SF got a new job for
you I want citizens satellites and space

486
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,330
to get rid of all those jobs and is
gonna cost $200 million dollars per pot

487
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,668
to go get 10 pieces

488
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:11,230
space access is always expensive you're
gonna say okay I'll be there

489
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,850
where's my increase in budget and I'll
ask a

490
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,149
right no no no you do this for what you
have so no one was this job because it

491
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,820
means you have to stop doing other
things

492
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,049
to go to become the garbage man right to
go you know this up in space

493
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,799
I'll home all their law school ideas

494
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,220
question was asked how would you clean
it up there are lots of ways you could

495
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,360
do that the the biggest thing we can do

496
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,219
to try to reduce the growth through the
debris is get rid of the dead satellites

497
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,019
doesn't be and so you could conceivably
go to those with another spacecraft

498
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:52,090
and grab on and move them physically you
could go out and attach something that

499
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,470
would inflate a balloon

500
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,880
increases surface area increase the
dragon dance with little atmosphere is

501
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,470
there

502
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,340
and was slowly spiral in and burn up you
could also if you want to read that as

503
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,049
you will have me in pieces little agree
that which is the real

504
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,639
the stuff the only way with that i've
seen that makes sense

505
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:14,120
here a little stuff probably violates
more than one or two trees

506
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,229
and that would be to put a laser in
space and you basically zap

507
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,510
and if you burn away a little bit

508
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,790
was piece is a small debris it acts like
a rocket engine

509
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,780
and gives it a a trajectory that you can
cause it to burn you basically not at

510
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,200
war

511
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,480
you don't zappa and causes vaporize use
that in such a way that you push it

512
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,080
so that goes into orbit world coming to
the problem is if you missed my

513
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,179
another satellite you go potential you
know

514
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,350
disaster in the meeting there also so
there are things you can do about that

515
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,459
we've chosen

516
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,600
well make her child you know orbital

517
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,669
me game yet fiber

518
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,000
better solution in a very year

519
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,260
by good and me day as better bandwidth

520
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,690
in all here white by

521
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,080
you do they have a lot of the
communications you should go in effect

522
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,110
until it's happening

523
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,159
%uh if you look at the the radio help
with the planet

524
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,000
I was basically cry so I think about is
a buddies house was looking at us

525
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,210
writer they're gonna fight as we were
far more ways you

526
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,990
forty years ago than we are today and is
because the efficiency or systems

527
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,900
remembers lease

528
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,510
leakage radiation also laid a lot around
lines love our

529
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,940
getting right back though

530
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,960
and you that by its very nature Assange
Julian

531
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,029
me solar flare you ship

532
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:46,359
being you could do a lot you can do a
lot with that I i think is concerned

533
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,460
about the security

534
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,479
for other fiber you guys again maybe
paranoid about that in return

535
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:55,559
I but up what and also things happen

536
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,450
nothing's completely secure nothing's
completely without risk I i think we

537
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,989
should be doing more that

538
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:04,179
I really do I think we somehow
redundancy some tobacco

539
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:08,739
as it would make you using that's right
so

540
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:15,739
that very or was right on a very large

541
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,849
romance injections with that the
innocents

542
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:25,859
conservation wardens extension it could
be that they would have a warning

543
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,309
we have a we have a satellite call the
advanced composition explorer me ace

544
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,070
which is located at your son runs point
l1

545
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,289
which means isn't ways I gravitation was
taking place in

546
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,239
it can stays between us and the Sun all
the time alright

547
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:47,210
Sony scrotal mass ejections are coming
out from the Sun

548
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,340
and the radiation asses the a satellite

549
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,549
is radiation detectors go oh well we
have something happening

550
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,239
and it actually since the radio
broadcast to the earth light travels

551
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:58,979
faster

552
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:03,320
them as particle radiation so we get
about eight to 10 minutes morning

553
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,999
and there are lifeboats on the space
station that if there's a fire or his

554
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,520
him I think he's a degree

555
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,049
or there's a big radiation storm coming
the astronauts are actually trained very

556
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:15,899
quickly getting his life blows

557
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:20,098
and come home so I think they would be
able to get away

558
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,240
if you have time one thing I think

559
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,618
all this don't you the problem handle on

560
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,679
is since space is a big place in you
mentioned it

561
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,190
about satellite be in Lomira

562
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,369
like we're is this

563
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:44,010
%uh like where our weather satellites
wear a GPS satellites were

564
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,980
communications satellites in this were
mid-range well that mostly

565
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,230
a lot of well there are choosing to sell
it

566
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,569
research using as well which is outta
26,000 miles

567
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:59,970
and that's pretty far out other GPS
satellites awarding or

568
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,328
Gordon Rockhold universal they're
they're above

569
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:06,080
57 along urs billions I G O

570
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,870
and that their loss at like sarin that
few thousand a longer

571
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,220
altitude range a lot satellites

572
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,060
or in low Earth orbit which means
they're under a thousand kilometers

573
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,710
and that's the reason I worry about than
most because that's the most successful

574
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,110
and there's a large chunk here never
really lowered stuff Reinoso

575
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,270
when you get around 700 kilometers

576
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,680
as far enough out there is going to be
around for a long time and there are a

577
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,879
lot of satellites their

578
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,150
long weather satellites for
communications advice love

579
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,490
fence lights the powers of observation
spacecraft here

580
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,830
so there's a lot no was the infant

581
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,850
you call were satellites cast

582
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,529
each other stranger

583
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,410
you know the castle in a threatening
after Jason Kessler

584
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,750
it was that tried these tree you have
the

585
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,970
yes that's what they're trying to do
don't you going about your week and it's

586
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,770
a great thing but

587
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:06,210
I'm a I is also into movies

588
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,520
is my seen your overall 0

589
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,290
report it's a fun movie the signs right
I was on the consultants and a

590
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,400
it was a real pleasure working with that
group they wanted to be right

591
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,020
you'll throw things at me when I say the
other movie I canceled because the

592
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,130
Directorate more me

593
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,200
and that was up that early at my time at
nasa the

594
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,470
remake lost in space okay

595
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,609
so the science in this horrible but they
told me they would ignore me a bit

596
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,280
conflicted with what they want to do

597
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,660
for the morning %uh but it was kinda
calls your name out there but

598
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,540
some some movies will try to get it
right and actually haven't talked to

599
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,220
people who know I'm consulting and
movies being made right now

600
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,029
and directors really trying to get it
right others don't care so much and I

601
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,010
really enjoy gravity and that's what
they were trying to portray

602
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,030
gravity but it was very dramatic right

603
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,260
and and it wouldn't happen is laid out
in Randy

604
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:03,070
at all it would that would have with
when you're making reference to do with

605
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,540
the alert on CME

606
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,900
up %eh the solar observatory and

607
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,329
Colorado misty more our observations

608
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,359
and they have a couple

609
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,369
homes on conjul that way you know

610
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,350
all

611
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,460
Sean satellite upbringing around world

612
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,390
in him

613
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,868
there's actually feel called space
weather yeah

614
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:31,710
and our space weather headquarters is in
colorado if you get on the internet you

615
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,779
will space weather

616
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:37,230
was kinda the equivalent of Noah and
that no one's love it well as your space

617
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,760
and her husband from hell of Greek

618
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,940
over all good call heard 3

619
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,970
it is real space weather is a is a very
real feel

620
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,689
and other lot a lot of people involved
in it because you can save a lot of

621
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,140
money

622
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:57,140
for satellites to do that as questions
100

623
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,690
a new you mention use your am

624
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,650
you shower blue volunteers re

625
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,910
world on you know

626
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,690
online very very low because of this
stuff from a comment did you see that

627
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,750
makes you sort of like

628
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,600
you show was that is inside the grave
say and most as

629
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,200
his eyes rates and smaller than a pea
you're moving really fast

630
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,310
that really fast rules is this the
comedian to the atmosphere is opposed to

631
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,500
a close second

632
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,930
while he moving at twenty to twenty-five
dollars

633
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,350
really really fast as yours movies
released review but is few and far

634
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,120
between

635
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,230
they're very it looks like a lot but is

636
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,580
across the great distances at night
anything like that there really isn't

637
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,150
that much

638
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,810
there is a concern and they watched
closely and and and bought a few times

639
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,840
satellites may have been hit during a
meteor showers by his commentary

640
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,420
that is very hard and it goes back to my
opening statement that space being

641
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,880
be it'd be right minutes into it with
him

642
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,330
not realize just how much longer is up
there and that's why he's half million

643
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,230
pieces of debris don't like law

644
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,420
but they're circling the planet every
nine minutes

645
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,730
and preseason loss probability or
against

646
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,429
you know

647
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:22,939
there been any %um that's what I am

648
00:39:22,939 --> 00:39:26,769
alloy the action %um

649
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:31,359
not to my knowledge there there have
been reported

650
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,380
packs where someone has gotten to the
point

651
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,059
were they could have him and it is sad
but and a good sense not to do it

652
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:46,179
okay up my guess would be in this is
just the ASB room there's a private

653
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:46,829
citizen

654
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:50,239
not representing missus is less chance
and pontificate

655
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,900
I would guess is one of those up it's
also a while ago

656
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,829
group just as you would like to do yes

657
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,609
I would hope is not a 15-year-old base
but %um

658
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,859
susan is a bit much but up

659
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:09,150
me up is how it's made Bernard you know

660
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,269
that back us in any way no

661
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:16,308
no for there is what what what what was
pretty amazing to me there is

662
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:21,910
sons up dust then there's the atmosphere
comes to the service every year

663
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,618
just from space from the degree that we
fly from this nation's

664
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,909
degree and satellites burn up in less is
a

665
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:32,869
the he's is very solemn sky locating and
removing these

666
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,179
Skyler region around and your big
satellites

667
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:40,369
intentionally re in for over the South
Pacific where there's no one around

668
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,350
right to do that is something

669
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,720
the scissors Moses those burns up in the
upper atmosphere

670
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,259
incisions vaporizes and you get lead
lucien the atmosphere

671
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,920
compared to what I hardly ever I have
you you know probably no

672
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,330
law so up is is not evenly worry about

673
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,490
there have not been to my knowledge in
reported cases

674
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,299
anyone on the ground it myspace there is
a link back

675
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,200
so years ago Alabama who's actually did
blame you you

676
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,069
right yet it was a ruse invest around
the house

677
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,210
funny who play Andrews drolet and course
it was a woman Alabama

678
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,630

real

679
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,810
a real yet but that's not the only thing
I more yeah

680
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:30,660
I say that because I live in Alabama

681
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:36,399
I okay will think you are viewing and
your sauce

682
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,830
anybody's interested one reason that one
was unable to look here's

683
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,840
by I saw a few books I have copies of us
both cellular and satellite sales

684
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,510
published by Springer are not as a whole
is alright

685
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,780
I've to publishers my at non-fiction

and I have puzzler sailing

687
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,430
if you really want to know the future of
really cool space exploration

688
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,980
the technology can I talk more I'm on
sourcing

689
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,210
and I'll I'll tell you everything's
going on about solar sails

690
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,450
I also got a look back at your call a
living off the land space is that we can

691
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:09,710
use

692
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,250
resources space deserve more a
sustainable

693
