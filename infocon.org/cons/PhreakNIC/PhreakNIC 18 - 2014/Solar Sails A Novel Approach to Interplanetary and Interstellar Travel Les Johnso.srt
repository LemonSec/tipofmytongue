1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,060
okay I'm you what are you going

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,500
yeah going alright very good my wife
might be

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,040
a little bit better than yesterday
slowly coming out prime in stage

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,490
play you the impression you have you got
it by

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,948
workers is a new about toss my is less
chance

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,699
i misses a presidential forever

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,090
national Hill I currently live in a
small world

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,640
nasa Marshall Space Flight run yup

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,399
Senior Technical Advisor UN-sponsored
sauce yeah he's actually schools

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,269
sales I really enjoy what I do and in my
career

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,190
and outside of my career I have many
solar sail technology

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,489
kinda focus his way through my day job

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,718
as well as opposed to that is the
outside world

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,809
and well you're talking to you today
well

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,229
is also house I'm into you overview

16
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,549
what is your major sellers of last night
just answer that for review

17
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:04,989
and i'm saying what is good for when the
Hindu

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,240
whether to enable far earlier

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,500
no enables goes rawrz this is a
technology is winless

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,000
things for a lot of primarily rely
spacecraft small spacecraft

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,820
humans we just hear you

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,130
and is a technology that has gone from
science fiction

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,408
up twenty five years ago to reality

24
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,219
today lol through with this review

25
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,788
here's all the social contact
information enjoy hearing from people

26
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,340
your feedback and I will select all of
us please let me know

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,140
i jus reign in the back online is a
selling houses and a lot more science

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,710
books

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,259
as well as ice fishing and a lot of
talking about

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,899
you know my love solar sails gyro a

31
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,119
leading European explorers solar cells
eligible

32
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,429
any and just as it works I am selling a
home

33
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,569
James liberal I'm inside anyway because

34
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,659
professionally times cited: I'm sciences

35
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,810
his I'm not & Noble or I'm not only the

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,130
this is not so location is honest says

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,930
my bill is the caliber of my work is not
yet published

38
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,170
to journal Science make I mean I was
like primo journals

39
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,190
where nobel laureate public words
represent along your push

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,239
ackhouse I was I L but hey

41
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,489
nation because nature magazine review

42
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,090
are solo sail and monogamous

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,989
regardless for popular signs this is not
a test

44
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,240
yeah I was released I have a friend hey

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,870
and I'm so excited about it I miss my
wife

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,330
and she said let her make worries aside
a

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,060
this I think you're almost leftovers
list for peace

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,120
I mean it's just is the is a you'll be
on that list but

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,760
that says here let me tell you that's
all I'll say this:

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,280
were well

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,120
problems last night every sample no mas
around you can you feel it

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,780
it is very robust but I'm not challenge
right here at the question here

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,210
if you try but just holding onto it has
been around

54
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,910
probably not the image okay this
material

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,790
is appalling is plastic 700 engines
aluminum

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:35,130
both eyes 3 microns thick human
dimensions as for those using our policy

57
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,810
challenge

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,890
as about size over here maybe a little
bit less than a minute

59
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,059
you're here and he put his ass face

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,560
2009 wasn't reflected the muscles back

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,400
like will reflect from and with that
good news that

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,540
show lie has no trespass

63
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,579
but it does happen we've known this for
a hundred years

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,000
okay satellite space right now have to
contend with his constant

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,320
work and actually have to correct your
trajectories

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
always call her at which is where they
point

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,340
because the solar pressure is very small

68
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,280
so you were else for football okay

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,579
but over time it as a right

70
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,650
so what will happen is sales especially
small spacecraft

71
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,030
will experience the exhilaration the
only formula that uses

72
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,330
as people in the day forces mass times
acceleration

73
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,359
the soul of course covers at a distance
from the Sun sconce

74
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,860
so he can a celebration as large wanna
lo mandes

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,940
right so you wanna make spacecraft in
sales is lightweight

76
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,090
awesome that's why would they have a
very thin materials

77
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,390
very lightweight materials is this small
bush

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,360
to get the celebrations spacecraft your
space craft

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,270
like way a question I always ask

80
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,930
it is OK when asked again even on the
next play and I did every time

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,890
treasury services less right ruling late

82
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,469
Sun I understand houses over here and a
sable

83
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,760
and the light was less from it you move
away

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,599
from the Sun turns out solar sails
ration

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,440
forming their today spacecraft towards

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,050
sears is a how you doing well he
intended

87
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,800
yeah is that the earth is were rounds we
were all very

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,350
365 one-quarter days saw him leave all
your

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,880
you're right show you're still more
rounds

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,260
this is my first son were with around

91
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,789
okay so you're spacecraft say it wasn't
worth it

92
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,950
around you why is almost sale

93
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,560
your life yes the pushin

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,540
outward water moving rails you will
spiral

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,010
now problems if you still

96
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,409
yours is able and change the name will
reflect

97
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,860
you remember your first year physics you
to that

98
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,140
revised is this you remember how at
force

99
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,300
what that means is you change the net
force acting on sale

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,560
international component designs Russ
active along the way you are removing

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,760
was that dudes beach you up futile

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,030
sale the other way is lotion day ago

103
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,150
might see it instills in the same

104
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,390
you could spiral %um workout from Sun

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,620
season actually spiral in a very close

106
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,370
and as you get closer there's more like
following

107
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,800
sale so this prestigious water and
sailed

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,400
was their as rebels the site is down or

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,090
and less rescued yet because you must
like Paul

110
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,429
homes San Antonio Soler salesman

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,360
is all about reflecting is much like any

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,990
and being able to control the warrant
Asian for sale

113
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,240
this yes rails

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,509
feel it now

115
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,789
discover that this is showing that

116
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,719
you remember in Haiti doing lots lying
down planes

117
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:16,250
you wonder why I will go to waste my
time and I forces

118
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,280
on wooden blocks calling them like
planes

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,378
it's because flying solo sailing you
know him

120
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,229
okay see add up the forces you get a net

121
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,318
Russ along your philosophy Dec or
antiparallel

122
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,490
sorry for the solar solar sails over the
long history

123
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,659
Maxwell 24 little of electromagnetism
was

124
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,529
near here everything you guys do if he
had known

125
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,509
we will be flying in space now I'm mad
you can arrive

126
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,129
thrust solar sales Maxwell's equations
okay

127
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:55,060
so he didn't do that he could is just
something he did

128
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,409
the first known writings about store
sales were treated to russians

129
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,099
constantly so costly improvements and

130
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,150
they are the ones you know this all were
milling around in space

131
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,039
people everything is on time but they
were improper gonna

132
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,430
one round

133
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,670
rocketry and they overlap a little bit
lower left with

134
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,280
never saw realize the first measurements
a lot of pressure

135
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,909
space was done in 1964 the US

136
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,470
lose big blue be mile or balloons were

137
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,640
there's need video online was actually
Kamrava keep the balloon all

138
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,949
package you can see this then inflate
you can see the people standing there

139
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,060
you're helping his use this was just a
measure aerodynamic drag

140
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,550
but they were also able based on health
already K from real solutions

141
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,870
they figured out what forces were acting
on it to bring it here

142
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,930
and they were able to pull out figure
out how much rest

143
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,300
was gay from sunlight for flexible as
the humanized my little

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,410
so those first measurement space up
polls over

145
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,550
citizens actually use but not as

146
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,880
primary balls back in the 70s

147
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,260
there was a mission going to Mercury's
weird

148
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,800
the hell for lunch and Starcraft lot

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,650
he's revives sparks was used in everyday

150
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,920
and so the spacecraft kept changing the
way it was when

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,699
and they burned up all of your attitude
control

152
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,210
extra fuel use spacecraft stabilize what
the guys did

153
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,570
in mission control as they said well
less used

154
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,060
pressure sunlight and how will be you
will the solar arrays

155
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,599
to keep the spacecraft levels doesn't
tumble out of control

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,860
they did and they successfully completed
the mission

157
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,440
uses sunlight fresh keep the spacecraft
balance

158
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,850
so they wouldn't start tumbling and not
you please

159
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,310
so that was one of the first uses in
space is over

160
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,599
to maintain space for the water

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,490
Europe a solo sailing was really in the
nineties

162
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,350
Gruebel russians said you know

163
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,770
Conrad this was back in the began really
the soviet days

164
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,000
you know on the russian days you know
Conrad got a real problem in siberia

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,970
those long long nights I came to russia
masses arriving from

166
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,520
those long nights sleep people to be
depressed

167
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,100
Andrew lots and lots of alcohol and our
economic outlook is provided

168
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,780
so what we need to do is we need to be
yours

169
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,180
orbit reflect sunlight down on those
long Siberian nights

170
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,560
so that our people won't bring so much
fun and will be more overnight

171
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,160
and all Soviet Russian apparatchik

172
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,520
by insulated lose an omelet

173
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,290
after they had space craft of your space
station

174
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,469
they complaining rotating say it was a
%uh feel like my alarm saloon

175
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,130
eyes it way out with friends true force
in the rotation

176
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,160
get this stabilize reflected light
general reno

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,020
and Henry stations set up measure little
bit ly

178
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,650
you barely knows it wasn't worth it was
moving very fast if you were standing

179
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,730
where waters

180
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,000
and you in complete darkness might have
noticed something probably not

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,230
but your instruments detected they went
back

182
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,520
he said comrades this work greatness to
you

183
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,380
so they flew another image when they
deployed to say it was an antenna

184
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,280
on the spacecraft was supposed to
retract before they deploy the sale

185
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,569
it did not track sources say old boy you
wish

186
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,000
red now we've since learned the team
needed

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,830
yes did never believe they would be like
siberia

188
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,870
that was with it until the politicians
to define

189
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,290
okay they were trying to go solo se
because they wanted to demonstrate the

190
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,270
capabilities

191
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,220
satan's yeah been good members
bureaucracy

192
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,350
they appeared at work your arms get to
do with it

193
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,709
doing okay sold house first real space
demonstration

194
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,119
the dingy they didn't actually measure
the celebration thrust

195
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,790
he was appointed him which is immoral
your industry

196
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,449
technology once pretty cool

197
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,550
following that the germans

198
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,550
said we're gonna fly solo sail so in the
late 90s

199
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,949
they built this brown demonstrator in
this is important because

200
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:37,300
few years later project and I manage for
nasa remember speaking as a private

201
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,769
citizen you're not speak

202
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,199
rivers massive we don't think this guy
said yes

203
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,790
so less chance of other sciences ice
fishing say

204
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,248
but yeah alright so

205
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:53,800
there is a this space craft
demonstrators amal

206
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,870
they played a 20-meter by twenty music
20 beers on side

207
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,439
which translates into about for you Ross
say

208
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,170
they didn't do it back they just wanted
to see the gym package it

209
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,540
and get autonomously boy these composite
was whispering in Tripoli

210
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,620
means okok by today's standards but they
had composite

211
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,790
and this is the team looking at their
success this was done

212
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,849
up

213
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,070
over haha laid out in Times New

214
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,770
you feel like you're right it's just
wonderful you talk about talking to the

215
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,120
germs don't want to Mission Operations
Center

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,290
in just your profile meanwhile or

217
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,380
are then there's very cool places the

218
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,580
German operations but anyway the dentist
appointment

219
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,000
there is a mission call Odyssey and they
posted by: all selected

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,030
and European Space Agency German Space
Agency but basically said

221
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,380
sales go away so

222
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,670
at about that time I my career change

223
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,849
I was that nasa Marshall working in the
US space transportation program

224
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,470
I was of me I was a personal message new
sciences

225
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,650
for an experiment using something called
space tether I got a load of like

226
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,650
talking about

227
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,120
and I was working that and here's
another of Psychiatry to come to his

228
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,620
office

229
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,120
because they were fun to get this and
you must be working former funny is that

230
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,940
your other job

231
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,180
Nozomi at Marshall with much rocket

232
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,900
jobs and I say that with a reason
Marshall Space Flight Center building

233
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,610
Ross

234
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,610
most people here aerospace engineers a
little weird i misses

235
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,210
okay the aerospace engineers Mechanical
Engineers whatever

236
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,260
and they are thinking about space
shuttle main engines

237
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,920
big Ross being rocks alright sup

238
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,760
at this time nasa administrator gone to
GPO is known for doing the space

239
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,439
missions

240
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,010
and a challenge

241
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,160
over the propulsion system to do amid
the mission I mentioned last night

242
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,439
calling our store pro which would go out
further and faster that way

243
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,060
and to do in the near term and he said I
want you to go talk to you guys

244
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,060
and moral because I'm paying those
people to do

245
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,729
hold to work on this so the request came
to our room

246
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,550
for somebody to go support repeal and
looking at the

247
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,030
are still a problem well you can't do
this with the rock

248
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,160
there's no way you can get those speeds
and distances wrongs

249
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,250
and I was in the room with my colleagues
to release more

250
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,850
the bases black and its

251
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,380
so that's ridiculous why would anybody
want to do that hahaha who's going to be

252
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,210
stuck with it

253
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,250
and I'm sitting here thinking
essentially cool

254
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,940
signing up right so I raised my hand and
everyone was really the greatest the New

255
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,790
York he's

256
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,890
the guys are tough questions later fire
he could

257
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,260
so I worked in jail for a few years on
that and

258
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,170
ultimately that led to a project got a
whole other story about all that

259
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,790
out

260
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,490
I II head and is there still a rose that
one of the things that happens we had a

261
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,060
deal

262
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,939
and that headline was to come up with a
story of how we would do it not only

263
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,490
holes in the communications spacecraft
jail he believes Rawlings a

264
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,440
Paul I was the whole thing so he
administrator call

265
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,170
said I love it seems to me that whatever
know why rivers maryland

266
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,780
I think and is its kinda executive 3
Washington

267
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,660
up bureaucrats Kong's everything is
pretty nice post

268
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,900
so we were flown at White River to use

269
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,470
we have a whole day with the Ministry
mass

270
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,920
at this time I'm mid-level guy

271
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,969
at Marshall you know I was just in awe
going to talk

272
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,970
she's right deny this its this one about
president so I go in and there was a

273
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,730
reason I do

274
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,250
region on a solo sail and nuclear
electric propulsion

275
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,190
and different things promotion that we
looked at and why we selected

276
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,360
solar sails Eastern asking do you have
another home ideas too was that before

277
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,210
was that your

278
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,829
for at all is OK so that's all fine

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,340
will be another project come up here

312
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,310
managing mister yeah I thought I needed
to tell somebody and they said the only

313
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,260
person I can tell you what you want me
to do

314
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,940
and we'll be back said basically don't
worry about it

315
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,340
gotcha back to whatever the go was over
the next four years I got to meet his

316
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,270
project is a part in this project we
develop was

317
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,830
these among many other things we worked
on electric propulsion

318
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,770
a row capture organized I can you talk
on all those I can talk all day

319
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,139
probably years I'll and we developed to
the solar sails

320
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,500
so when you see your pictures taken from
the top up the world's biggest faction

321
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,400
change which is in Sandusky Ohio

322
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,710
alright don't ask me why send us

323
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,150
I have no idea probably an impartial
congressmen or senators

324
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,899
morning alright politics somehow I don't
know

325
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,110
but as the world's biggest back chain
you going to those places like

326
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,750
I it's just an enormous okay they can
cut this down

327
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,830
to the vacuum that the shuttle
experience her spacecraft has to pay

328
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,279
stations traces its incredible facts

329
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,320
so what we did is we thank you companies
to come up

330
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,750
competing designs resources and send it
in order

331
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,510
to basically we do harm to many survive
testing under vacuum conditions

332
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,220
and under the temperature extremes the
your counter in space

333
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,500
it all has to deploy timeously has to
have certain

334
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,909
right onto s lightweight creative way
towards

335
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,649
what had to be so these are two
different technologies

336
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:27,510
a store sales they would avoid the one
on the right things to a mechanic who

337
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,039
just think about the same show usability

338
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,980
to move around a policing whiners and

339
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,299
everything else here the team unless it
has to do anything

340
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:42,570
were used as interested in interior the
inflight like a balloon

341
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,799
and you can inflate its trading and when
it gets cold it becomes rich is the

342
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,980
asking the way

343
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,169
and makes really lightweight blue so
inflatable system worse

344
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,520
campuses their withdrawal this work was
not tested both up more

345
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,980
the sales for a hundred feet in diameter
and both unemployed people are smaller

346
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,580
than half as

347
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,590
really small incredible 15

348
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,590
40 in each box happens really amazing
will happen after that

349
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,789
yes it was decided that I was going to
focus its efforts on when Maxim

350
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:21,650
remember that yeah and all the
technology news polls

351
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,770
to the program scans we have a slight
st. Clair

352
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:30,470
and we did not get to fly right so what
happened in that same time period

353
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,299
any members and Planetary Society in 90
the plungers

354
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,179
private space advocacy group and up the
Ohio bill Nye

355
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,020
the Science Guy at the time you can
stream

356
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,158
gonna so they decided to build the
world's first solo sail

357
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,419
and they're going to at all privately
all private funds so they had all the

358
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,250
membership up

359
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,520
I got some sponsors they got somebody
that will do so for sale

360
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,379
this advance launches expensive nasa
stalled out what they're doing

361
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,299
Germany's quit doing it russia's quit
doing that by golly we're going to do it

362
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:03,379
we want these damn

363
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,669
so the bill for sale with the russians

364
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,080
this is we need to get this place and
the russians with two

365
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,770
Russian accent right just looking into
it came in and said he got a deal for

366
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,340
you

367
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,799
yeah your comforting are are some really
launched ballistic missiles to be

368
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,090
rockettes through commercial halos

369
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,320
past she moves very few

370
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,220
and we will fly and sailors use
Planetary Society

371
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,289
that are looking for right I don't blame
for that

372
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,070
so that you heard where they get a rush

373
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,919
russians launch it she splash I

374
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,730
the Planetary Society up

375
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm going on with him sorry you know

376
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,139
robles the planetary society have lights
peer

377
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,390
which is going to be important to so
they said okay

378
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,040
Australia the russians came back and
said you know we figure out what we were

379
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,409
all

380
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,750
what drew you payers money will play

381
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,070
give you a great deal in all the wrong
with you mare paid the money

382
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,990
home thank you that was it

383
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,590
because most they didn't stopper their
comeback since was on the whole likes a

384
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,570
little talk about

385
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,210
demands and they are not alone runs I

386
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,340
yeah outside

387
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,669
so I mention these big solar sails we
will this sale right

388
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,710
on wall with mike was a this is called

389
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,250
while before right while as 14

390
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,020
we had a little bit of money left over
within whose programs cancel

391
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,420
and we had this hardware so we could
afford to fly

392
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,600
the spacecraft was big sale was so what
can we do

393
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,949
with several issues with these new
fangled Q se switches

394
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,930
3 there tends to be less sensitive ears
interview Q's

395
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,690
the modular there are mostly used by
universities

396
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,220
for a very low cost base for i three you
use that means

397
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,360
37 views sizable over it okay

398
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,240
so what we did is weak Cup with quotes

399
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,370
and made a sale here which is about
three and a half years

400
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,889
sites that one got four moons deployed
from the Middle

401
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,310
accuse at and we said we want to fly to
Cinespace

402
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,340
as a demonstration 2.0 will hit you up

403
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,120
if you are more than just a place in the
balloting one wash

404
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,860
booth I okay you can tell us or sales

405
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,479
have a little bit of bad luck getting
the space at this point alright

406
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,810
so what we did is we have flights fear
well

407
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,200
so we win it to another spacecraft which
was a deity ish

408
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,790
call fast in which investment

409
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,210
a little lawyer on SL so they would kick
off in a sealed the

410
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,400
in space and floor of asset reach orbit

411
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,450
it was time for the Nano sat at a sale
to deploy

412
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,840
nothing happened it did not the team
look at trying to figure out what went

413
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,270
wrong

414
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,050
couldn't figure out well basically said
we have no idea

415
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,139
so kind of conduct that said it is
business

416
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,120
in about three months later pass an
experienced

417
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,459
and I'll something funny happened a
spacecraft

418
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,550
minute blow I'll all okay

419
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,389
and so the flight team was trying to
figure out your space for many things

420
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,420
that can act on this

421
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,530
well because spacecraft like this to go
well

422
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,340
is still functioning was hit by debris
that's what happened and

423
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,770
wanna party with me original the one
raised her hand and said you know this

424
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,330
looks exactly like the celebration we
would have expected

425
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,350
departments sat with no sale at looked
at all

426
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,429
on time and idk it down because they're
just trying to push their

427
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:52,690
and the migration was just like what we
respected miss a quick turn on the radio

428
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,140
has the treasure only have power for
like three yes

429
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,240
alright so the team frantically you know
that solve everything

430
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,160
free horribly out really well yes %uh it
just turns receivers

431
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,480
mall zen-like whole I

432
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,740
its employees and we were able to you

433
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,600
ground-based photographs metres tall up
the sales

434
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,610
as it was before

435
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,149
spends it's my understanding and I
haven't seen

436
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,920
that certain 3 liberation seagulls
really beautiful pictures or space

437
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,290
I have not really be /c

438
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,690
girl's mother fucker I would really like
to see yeah

439
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,290
what at about the same time flying in a
sealed even japanese

440
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,129
acting in three preseason ludicrous

441
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,940
last night on a joke about winning games
right you remember your father

442
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,870
risk lose to a close too close to the
Sun and came to a backhand

443
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,840
yes the Japanese numerous I guess they
did this to read the news

444
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,240
a they flew a mission to Venus

445
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,460
as a secondary Qingdao and the 2014
bierbauer 14u

446
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,430
rotation was the worst losing this is
still flying today

447
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,440
they are the first people to demonstrate
interplanetary source a

448
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,670
uses ill prior nichols' they divorced

449
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,590
they started after we quit yeah and just
landed

450
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,800
and not only do they do it they are
really killing

451
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,970
and how they do it their sale has to
lose

452
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,200
it slowly rotates to you was very
lightweight

453
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,810
doesn't have separate solar rays to
generate power the two thin film

454
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,649
photovoltaics

455
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,700
that it was a generate power for me

456
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,710
the same and they don't have anything
mechanical

457
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,430
22 until sale everything we've been
looking up some campuses in the mood

458
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,230
remastered zippers or sale

459
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,300
what they did is the code is on the sale
was an electrochromic

460
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,669
good yes which beach voltage across and
nice

461
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,060
dark yup when you don't like as much
light presale you have

462
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,360
thrust bright and early push on this
happens a lil

463
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,280
the partnership strong runs until the
weight room so they do

464
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,080
all here's karen solids pretty pro

465
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,240
I yes I'm sending chills okay

466
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,720
I they beat us to it just awesome
engineering

467
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,810
brilliant man on a mission plans to go
to choose

468
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,220
wholesalers well that here's a picture

469
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,040
a series of issues taken from Google
rose

470
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,810
around he is europeans the cell phones

471
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,330
were taken while measure space craft was
actually sell

472
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,340
camp there was cake of Motor Show to
look at the integrity of the sale

473
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,158
as it moved away hello power transmitter
is a signal that another show

474
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,579
ships into the area so we have a still
picture

475
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:46,499
images Nicholas right here does it work

476
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:52,309
have been used to it so what are we
doing Reesa planned demonstrations

477
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:56,959
and national missions the never met
cancellation will try to call Sunday

478
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,239
which was a very sore see all that was
supposed to be flown the nest

479
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,449
I really can't comment on that because I
will be using

480
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:07,829
my back and I'm speechless just read the
spaces are all about it

481
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,069
you were like say obviously projects and

482
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:15,079
good and yours that there are two other
projects

483
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,739
are being developed funny working on
your hands of call

484
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:24,639
near-earth asteroids calendar flashlight
there are going to fly solo sales

485
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:29,139
on I'm not as a dildo because we leave
our industry we're gonna go

486
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:32,879
to destinations using solar sails with
the excuses

487
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:35,968
at the same time doing that

488
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:40,979
the Planetary Society based on nasa's
never see windy in your experience is

489
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:45,309
with difficult problems 12 have built a
$3 you use at

490
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:48,579
white seal one and white sale to

491
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,379
their sales being written up 32 square
meters hours with him

492
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:55,908
they're gonna fly again all private
money they'll

493
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:59,139
flight able and inflate your after

494
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:01,349
non-russian

495
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:03,939
I so these are being dispersed his bill

496
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,599
is undergoing testing we have an
agreement with them as your day with us

497
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,859
world you someone last night ask about
how level we are working with the

498
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,570
Planetary Society informal

499
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,168
up in terms of the sure information
about that

500
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:20,559
there is another cue set sail

501
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,019
their usual on in sales I

502
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:27,349
at CU airspace University of Illinois
urbana-champaign

503
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:30,359
that harbors finish and is awaiting
funding

504
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,529
somebody we have been able to find funds
flight so the money has to be

505
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:39,829
this gives me here was councils of lines
I can tell you go talk to

506
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:43,079
at UIUC and %uh seniors

507
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,009
before the europeans also kicking tail
by Japanese

508
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,679
and see what we're doing said we want
back in the game

509
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,349
so they have planned and funded three
sources of life story like we are a few

510
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:56,899
says

511
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:00,458
working way of beer in beer sales so
they have

512
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,369
30 cost you 1 is complete and I believe
israel's language

513
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:07,840
ok cutie which is your view launched
happened

514
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,040
your cost shoes will be there Picasa 3

515
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,970
will be fifteen years sale like this use
and they're working on

516
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,810
preview free envisions also in Europe

517
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,370
there are three small solar sales the
developer University of Surrey

518
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,459
UK and I'm the American colonies your
monthly sales which we use inflatable

519
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,300
booms

520
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,870
not on the scale it was on the table the
moment he said

521
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:39,540
just love you technologies sales he's a
partnership that has three Space Center

522
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,090
in UK sleepers

523
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,129
but what other missions there and here's
our

524
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,270
well I'm happy I have something called
her last words

525
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,930
we were in which AT&T Hills Police
spacecraft us because they do you

526
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,480
planetary spacecraft for nasa is to be a
six-year hughes et st 3

527
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,740
religious wholesale only and as an 85

528
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,250
for your say deployed from spacecraft
sizes to Lowes over it

529
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,620
you 9185 for beers is about four areas
for

530
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,719
okay I hope spacecraft with up

531
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,240
its totally so we're going to play this

532
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,309
the honor the scale deployment don't
have to be the axe iraq has been taken

533
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:22,899
up

534
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,070
shootout with these days it takes about
two years to reach the F

535
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,029
the beautiful thing about this solar
soon as you don't have a few

536
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,490
all urs oration is right was late in
life

537
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,490
what that means is as long as the Sun
shines

538
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,610
and spacecraft is working we go anywhere
we want to go

539
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,408
there is no other options as the lead to
patch in such a small space

540
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:50,370
to do this mission the proposed reforms
were two engines

541
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,928
give local can't do it electric
propulsion which I talked about

542
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:54,429
yesterday

543
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,980
can do it only way to do that is
continues long

544
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,139
russell's so here's what the concept of
operations was like

545
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:06,830
were launch fly by William the sale
wayward

546
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,860
you will loose around

547
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,000
and the reason for living room is we're
waiting on you going to come in to

548
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,630
Britney's

549
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,840
be for us to get to so limited time you
lose

550
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,939
removal be determined by when we
actually more and we have to wait was

551
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,960
asking when the morning to visit to come
to the right place

552
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,990
so we can fly induce loomed

553
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,990
with a moon is going to give us a little
bit to grab this is not a whole

554
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:38,090
up we're gonna have to actually
capturing to allure

555
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,709
political leader orbit and we're
basically going to hang out there for a

556
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,220
while

557
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,320
and they were a flyout Graham goal I
heard earlier remedies as we could

558
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,360
and know how much they shoot us we might
have to have shorter trip timely doing

559
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,570
with remedies

560
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,189
but our customer has only to you and
this is a massive

561
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,860
just whose has given us a list last
words were interested in so it's not

562
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,370
just

563
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,979
you know India's a certain Wallace

564
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,510
and wants to look at I have you in the
know

565
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,510
rather with a what looked a

566
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,879
so we have to wait for the one he wants
to see if we can get to it with the

567
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,710
proportions

568
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,560
and was was need about this is the
mission will be considered a complete

569
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,149
success

570
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,649
you blogger function space for

571
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,179
they can still go places with the camera

572
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,520
communications the destination that i
won

573
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,300
oppose if we're successful in the
primary basically

574
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,369
go to the restroom also coupling

575
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,099
not in the half this is you know we
might be able to put this on clothes

576
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:51,599
solar yes not real was because the
spacecraft can survive the close enough

577
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
little differences Sun and we kissed the
solar system's

578
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,730
its own actually contemplating talk
about with her

579
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,850
management team up algaecide just
another project getting a little

580
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,810
container with

581
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,570
here since but lost the last a

582
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,010
all members of the team on board this
incident guardian angel stores

583
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,650
is what I like to do so i'm a dreamer

584
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,060
does and that's kinda yes are out

585
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:25,680
and we will if you do this

586
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,089
the same overalls and purposes won't get
much rest helped past

587
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,350
the Estoril part wage because there's a
small sale

588
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,049
and spacecraft to stop home here doesn't
have power

589
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,320
up but that's okay the secondary
emission

590
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,250
after the afterimage is really just
because key

591
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,790
okay and I don't know that at all

592
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,109
I up more I think chemicals so

593
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:53,700
that's that's not official that's just
something I'm talking about

594
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,230
it is officially we're going to have to
your kids about already

595
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,260
or be able to leave he could do workers
12

596
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,430
QBs I actually russell's the ones going

597
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,049
okay I'll issue if you will that you can
find a couple whose

598
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:15,790
room about news yes hit

599
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,500
no

600
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,470
it all sources that we have a whole
gases

601
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,490
because as the ones you cases of

602
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,979
really tumbling in here with the sale

603
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,099
so we have a little bit of old ass X

604
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:37,140
to stop and stainless then we don't want
to sale

605
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,140
sailors now there's another nations's
traditions not a harsh conditions look

606
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,200
like a deal

607
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,649
music souls room sales call flash

608
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,780
your flashlight funded mission

609
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,180
was gonna go to the moon those eliminate

610
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,419
Arsenal know whether it's not our site
and I'm offers a four-sided

611
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,040
you and an experienced day and night
with pink floyd

612
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,849
thinkers a for that ok a lot of people
say that there's a

613
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,150
our site that we don't see your we see
the parser what we haven't seen

614
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,180
is that the seven holes as the moon
doesn't have the accidental

615
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,330
your this there are craters sellable

616
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,710
that never goes away in the mood shares
the same

617
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,460
impact history paper look at the moon
our water

618
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,790
changing comments in your of a comment
deserves a minute in sunlight worst way

619
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,950
evaporate soulmates go away those big
kramer's

620
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,569
should have a nice because they haven't
had

621
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,940
anything about a little after 10
remember being years

622
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,080
Google I saloon a flashlight in going to
a loophole

623
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,790
orbit reviews the solar cycle to
decrease

624
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,250
apparel the periodicity with a close you
were

625
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,460
over to sell less than 20 Colo 12 miles

626
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,870
it's not for be and we're going over use
the sales reflect light

627
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,529
into the crater and take pic 200 okay

628
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,559
that's wonderfully resulting permission
you know

629
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,400
you can use all sales to help you with
this morning

630
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,760
to the solar storms that I talked about
yesterday

631
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,630
and recovery above Skyler satellites
feel solar storms for kinda things that

632
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,490
could knock em satellites recanting

633
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,419
things here for the space weather for
and scientists are interested in having

634
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,289
a warning

635
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:34,200
you can use solar sails take spacecraft
closer to the Sun

636
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,970
and thrust continuously sort always
stays between us and the Sun

637
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:43,339
conventional spacecraft when they close
at times will be on the other side

638
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:47,119
Sun as it's in a different world so the
only way you have continuous observation

639
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,589
for these storms

640
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:52,799
closer to the Sun and yours to hold
leave the spacecraft wanna

641
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:56,759
source that's not a plan

642
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,920
but it is something

643
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,130
happen huge another potential issues on
the whole

644
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,140
also right now we have just been a
satellite

645
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,770
or without you justin's they're not
really governors

646
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,270
orbiting the earth with the same period
that your rotate so it looks like the

647
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,970
motions

648
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,009
with the sale hovering above the earth

649
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,580
you can counter bolivia's Graham
literally flew in space

650
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,500
above yours polls your so and you can
use that ministers

651
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,310
study the whole reasons you or cell
another mission is it possible that

652
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:36,720
in addition asteroid you could use the
following comment the complete life

653
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,240
cycle

654
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,660
comment we can do this to do interesting
maneuvers with

655
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,509
up looking at a different side to the
Sun and yesterday I double talk about

656
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,220
how we might be able to use solar sails

657
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,950
to actually take is to store Sunday

658
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,299
and that's that there get back to why I
missiles

659
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,170
K solar sails great capability for the
near-term

660
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,610
alone a planetary travel I wanna see
humanity does

661
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:05,460
and I think this is one of those
technologies that two hundred years

662
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,520
we might give this a little sales sign
Texas

663
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,930
and actually since spacecraft store we
don't have to do that today

664
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,169
but we're taking first beast how fast
with just you know

665
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,240
wrongly really fast I

666
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,229
I TNA you for your and national regions
93 million miles

667
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,100
K up wage was not written anywhere close
to that is traveling

668
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,160
have almost a million miles a day we
will probably ten times faster

669
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,589
close to 10 million miles today think
about

670
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,080
watching tackled by okay forcefully
spaces the mostly empty

671
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,319
so rocket scientists our work yeah I i'm

672
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,900
I would like a whole lunch is over sales
that's what what's the problems

673
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,830
you know that

674
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,910
Thursday Prison Break well and we're
still right now

675
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,810
is the material science would be
detected by Mike on sale

676
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,779
or for like 10 ass rimjob to get back
I'll

677
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,800
out where it is between pass it on I
ever made you never made it there he got

678
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,500
that peace love

679
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,780
a solar cell passing RAM we need to get
him something that's about it here

680
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,910
to which one you think this is a bad
that has the same

681
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,069
curious for all-in-one all okay

682
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,590
well I i don't want to do that I think
the victim every

683
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,670
I i really wanna hold four minutes left
but first this phone will take somewhere

684
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,280
else not somebody to come over here on a
fine

685
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,780
to get a better idea I'm all ears okay
but right now I'm going to try to do

686
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,040
this

687
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,310
separately we're just not there
materials yet now for a lot of people

688
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,700
making these carbon fiber substrates
over

689
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,129
time that others like tonight he is and
posits lightweight followers

690
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,290
but we still have United owner
carbonated

691
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,170
will yes in fact it Google graphene

692
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,230
engravings incredible material and will
make a great sales

693
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:58,190
close use the is

694
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,680
rose following review

695
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,160
no it's not I have to get my talk I

696
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,618
talking to them till saying and and
change the language like reflects

697
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,640
and that changes for spectral sale and
you can use to celebrate

698
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,220
decelerate New York up for these are
still in church activities we actually

699
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,529
spiral in very close to the Sun think
inside the work

700
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,170
where the sunlight is a lot stronger
than you can really make a

701
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,539
to go well

702
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:31,809
up let me just %uh the hours that is
this is where we're going I was the

703
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:32,809
government still

704
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,890
trail no new solar sails to get there so
let me let me take questions

705
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,680
and I'll that over so you know you
believe how much

706
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,828
mass solar wind particles cool

707
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:48,539
sale ago we look at that

708
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:52,609
what does solar wind and don't be
confused sales do not say all this over

709
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:56,279
with there are technologies we're
looking at it was a little

710
00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:00,089
in business or sale a solar sails you
son

711
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:04,509
okay the solar wind is horrible
radiation from the Sun still like

712
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:07,700
its protons electrons helium atoms

713
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,720
mostly that's coming from the Sun is a
stream

714
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,098
beyond the solar system old we really
want to come by Julie K

715
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,489
most what they're going to do is you
pass through

716
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:22,170
or give us a little on from the salesman

717
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,509
wholesale chart and we have to be
careful because it will be conducted the

718
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:27,789
backside as an insulator

719
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:31,589
really care if we don't get different
church or build-up were actually works

720
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:32,150
rumors

721
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,700
sale so we're actually design sale to I
have letter conduction

722
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,899
yes which we did spacecraft to the
charges doesn't affect

723
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,390
old yeah for moseley's

724
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,690
you little bit currently someplace

725
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,970
that he was dead if we don't consider
respect your

726
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,629
reports I'm it's really as you guys yeah

727
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,740
so yesterday live on other stuff we have
to do what we have to worry about that

728
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,569
and as part of the design process is
something that we can solve %um

729
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:06,980
and if we have a static char problem
within your homework as we know

730
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,380
other questions you give

731
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,270
just LeBron's project time

732
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,990
all I know here a it's a whole lot of

733
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,140
I ru quickly you guys are collectible
times you know that

734
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,720
current flowing through a wire uses made
it to you alright

735
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,759
you know you're listening and a few yes
I'm appellant was proposed

736
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,210
I like taking advantage when they choose
gives out a living off the land space

737
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,970
resolve it Senate a good stuff with his
let's use with nations or

738
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,540
use Lee your is in the parliament

739
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,808
and of lying naked in her summer what
happens when you take the two more polls

740
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,920
amid

741
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,010
they repel to proportions is

742
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,910
a saw the tether project and I and II
mean to someone is in the US

743
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,490
I was a contest here Japanese like this
one

744
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,479
11 where we demonstrated yes and you
basically floor current rawrrr

745
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,180
in recipe or something that if you look
through the spacecraft around is

746
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,310
attached to the wire

747
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,630
with no few okay

748
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,990
and you can do this indefinite in Earth
orbit

749
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,368
it won't work in the spaces you're away
from your something that I feel

750
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:22,060
and I'm still getting planetary
atmospheres is another way to do

751
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:28,520
how was provoked and a lot of good if
you want uses solar Salem

752
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,340
embedded with electronic tethers in it
you can go over

753
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,760
earth to Jew solar sail

754
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,790
jupiter has one have a magnetic field
news

755
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,150
you can cash in at you Electra
dynamically with to

756
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,920
and the new room all who's a juvenile
with the wires in your sale

757
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,060
and not miss a single counsel for
appellant on the entire

758
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,350
okay so I have to ask people were still
fool around rockets

759
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,118
also all well they are but

760
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,720
they're forgetting of rail once we get
in space let's use the nations are you

761
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,569
put for us

762
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:06,808
it sufficiently use it and take
advantage

763
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:10,509
and that's camouflage for that up really
have one more question

764
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:13,529
and I'll take that as a No is a

765
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:16,549
about the spy usual for your candor

766
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,089
I I don't know if I seriously looked at
