1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,048
I thing is having

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:08,200
this is I

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,879
week media and chips any

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,129
a high so

5
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,280
people here had ever trying to

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,250
an article yeah K

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,750
many people here have tried to create an
article

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,350
p.m. did stay yeah I

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,809
created article my law school okay and

10
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,089
but the article is now basically nothing
that I really

11
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:39,829
people ok it's saying that NR

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,089
law school occurred there's nothing like
a cue

13
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:47,569
run which is wrong it's a constant flow

14
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:50,829
and normally yet talks I

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,979
I have people anything created articles
that generally most

16
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,379
their was stay say a huge day and

17
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,879
year I have checked the statistics this
week that

18
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,030
typically this at 1500 articles

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,400
three-acre day yeah

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,430
happy which urgently needed within 24
hours

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,840
and whether this is a time here's

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,030
trained communicate people how you can
get your articles

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,250
day paperweight damn so they don't get

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,080
a lot of those are also deleted every
day

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
are crack article said that he screamed
her

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,250
die-hard girl sitting next class or

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,360
or you know they're har as there are

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,100
that shit usually circles are created by
people

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,330
and good day but just didn't need we

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,660
standards that he also helped him keep
in mind that

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,910
articles are mostly by human being

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,390
and as human beings often get
overwhelmed by the house

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,630
mayhem closing his hundreds of articles

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,729
like that Charlie Chaplin you reside is
settling land is

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,620
yet we keep the balls many this he wears

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,399
schools often so the israelis hit

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,650
Julie completely they to eat something
that probably should

38
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,720
they're just so used to believing all
spam

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,859
so to keep an article having

40
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,579
the flagstick make it look to lead a
bowl the one thing I can say is that

41
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,689
sources Wikipedians source

42
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,090
article has sources and references it is
less

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,459
like believed to be that has no sources

44
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,530
references there like deal

45
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,650
in there is some gray and I'll talk
about that so

46
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,200
my own this video was I started hearing
about it

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,250
as fly because i distracting misleading

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,550
my website you want to know comment I
started seeing leads coming in from this

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:53,850
week

50
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,079
piano or hey yeah I'll back

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,430
and years crashing to Outback and

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,950
where you get a big saying there's probs
with their servers for that

53
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,458
and and I gotta get very interested in
the community

54
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,459
I was a general manager I'm unity it

55
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,070
game company and the weekend he was like
nothing had ever seen

56
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,140
I research I think communities already
that this week unity was

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,570
me and i got very interested in it and I
am

58
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,930
for election as the Administrator
elections that

59
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,010
that rightward that close here

60
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,920
have I got injected the community said
no

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,339
you know I'm passengers and so a few
months later and again and again and

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,270
again and I really got into the
community

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,040
I haven't and several months later it
was one of the most controversial

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,540
topics yes they have page help them

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,870
100 release the time anything in the
community would get a hundred or more

66
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,660
members

67
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,870
community participating in the
discussion and my

68
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,480
rather have ship was as listed on there
and was a very

69
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,519
close election discussion

70
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,870
but I finally made his ministry 2007

71
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,100
and here we are seven years later not
destroyed tragic

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,870
so I think overall it's a good thing
yeah thank goodness they

73
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,140
I may its is a way that members

74
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,180
community in the highway can't lose to
determine status

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,310
other people in the community what
happens the number edits

76
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,420
you have and I about 69,000 its last I
checked

77
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,230
and also another way they look a certain
way and will declared a

78
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,540
can you tell what's stacks I wonder
what's there

79
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,370
their level in the games

80
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,660
level 69,000 and its my level

81
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,880
article creation has over 500 which is
very I'm

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,570
I'm also creates I'll featured class

83
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,880
articles article has levels weepy it
starts off

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,229
as start nasty classy

85
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,800
class wake up to was calling good
article which requires

86
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,540
a review and each glasser hey

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,990
which requires a live hearing six months
to do you usually

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,290
if you can get an article to e-class

89
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,970
then it has the possibility featured on
Wikipedia

90
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,270
page and there's quite a competition for
this

91
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,690
and even have one a star

92
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,210
on your profile is considered quite
other to have two or three days

93
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,870
I did know on the slot you did not apply

94
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,350
yet so this is

95
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,660
of the gym class or that the

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,120
says today's featured articles so
anymore this case I just

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,849
took a screenshot than a year or so so
this was that building

98
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:50,610
coltrane's I any word see their said
lots

99
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,999
and buns and probably doesn't have
headers working on that article together

100
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:59,719
that level of quality that has been
scrutinized down to the level in the

101
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,789
country lesion in the sources

102
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,830
its source has no they months

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,389
abbreviated one source is not abbreviate
other servers that might be resistant

104
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,919
rejected azinger so it's the highest
level calling

105
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,349
get no im

106
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,399
back just it settle it's going okay

107
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,619
work but you can see the top here
there's perhaps

108
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:28,309
we have main page discussion source
history and watch

109
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:31,429
so every article on Wikipedia every page
every

110
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,518
he also has a discussion page the talk
page

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,990
and this is really editors will discuss
election happening

112
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,709
on the main article: page and as they
say you never want to see

113
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,809
laws and sausages and a with dr.

114
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,800
was convincing think there's a whole lot
of activity going on behind the scenes

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,919
so this is an example the discussion
page

116
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,229
it'll be people will create sections is
the girl

117
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,250
one person will post something

118
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,890
someone else bench was something else
sometimes these discussions will go on

119
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,880
for months and many megabytes

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,310
the sessions and sometimes you just UTC
shirt short sections like that

121
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,720
they also didn't see the history of the
page

122
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,060
and this will show you is all
transparency

123
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,380
every single it was ever made any heart

124
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,860
on the project the date it was me lead

125
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,860
and then go get some information about
him as well

126
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,110
and revenge I you can do it do it

127
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,020
you can see how I didn't read exactly
what has changed

128
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,570
since then told him and often bindles

129
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,030
lol searchlight one extra word

130
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,289
an article thing now one love you know
this it snows

131
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,080
very rapidly we have box there's and the
project so

132
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,500
profanity and as usual evening herded
back

133
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,570
over here rapidly and other editors

134
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,099
just police change troll although it was
the check for every single now

135
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,260
read it is it looked legit do tonight as
I big black people

136
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,840
and they're going through reviewing
every change yes article

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,049
you that wish was that my

138
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,820
hardly created his lead is it still in
history yes

139
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,300
so you need special privileges in order
to be able to see it

140
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,340
so as administrator go through and

141
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,250
good a spy and it'll say there was an
article here

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,320
would you like to see that revisions and
then I yes

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,490
ninety-nine percent time that's what I
can see there are certain

144
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,070
circumstances where members and the
community that have advanced positions

145
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,060
oversight

146
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,339
going in relieving back to the typical
administrator can see it for example if

147
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,470
somebody tries to

148
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,010
toxin go and put someone's address

149
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,170
phone number yeah NS

150
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,490
he did at an article that would still be
history that's okay

151
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,339
this

152
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,579
I'm will go to polls his Sony

153
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,138
used as one millions alerts

154
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,749
hundreds Rangers comparing it to other
sites such as Google

155
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,949
I'll at the time I this a

156
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,430
2011 who had close to a billion users

157
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,370
rather 20 billion dollars hear that

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,439
you know with $400 million is this
happens much

159
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,748
school that twenty million dollars
compared to twenty

160
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:36,180
billion dollars so it's a lot of cheers

161
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,508
a lot or I and there have been some
offers over the years for

162
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,559
people come in want to purchase
Wikipedia and homes

163
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,879
rejected there's a very the strongest
sense

164
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,279
identity within the community that he
wanted really don't want to be

165
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,100
advertised

166
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,709
supported this though there is a again a
little gray areas in this

167
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,099
we will license the database to someone
else saying here's

168
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,999
everything I would be a post on your own
site post liver ads

169
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:08,569
what there which is why sometimes my
google said he will like 25 years

170
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:11,899
and the same kind p.m. because this kind

171
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,280
license now yeah

172
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,000
area

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,110
why I guess the question was why would
some sites what

174
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,660
here content is going to be itself
specifically because they want to put

175
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,529
hands on it

176
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,490
they know that there might be a hot
topic that some Google and there's a

177
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,959
chance that their site

178
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,109
people that their sites 11 think it's
had

179
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,149
sessions right there also some sites
have it for other reasons they

180
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,779
they want to provide information about
topping on their site

181
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,050
and leave his their sources Sotomayor
the week

182
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,050
here been in love with my this
information is here

183
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,060
%um has been he has not right

184
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,060
all time and gets vandalized a lot
overall to Greece

185
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,120
so its is in limited resource

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,170
not terms and

187
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,760
its will finite he wanted to fight okay

188
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,639
it's not like weird publish if you're a
pretty relieved here that would take

189
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,250
criticize football stadium this site as
a reference

190
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,760
you printed everything on like that in
April

191
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,839
get inside you can happened volumes

192
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,209
other Encyclopedia Britannica people
this is about it

193
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,388
university research librarian stacks

194
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:40,240
maybe a couple roles you having

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,589
what's on the English you dance more if
you want to do

196
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:47,339
yards the other projects also the other
things with these

197
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,010
not a direct translation here each
language can

198
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,420
they have their own community and they
can really right what it is they what

199
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,229
seemed to be looking at one time thing

200
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,699
see they usually media the French
Wikipedia

201
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:06,529
he would yet the area he doin what help
they can get vastly different versions

202
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,670
depending on which language

203
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,079
no it is a

204
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,080
fast-growing project you can also get
numbers on the tax tax

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,750
each page this is a at past acts

206
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,980
rock I S me you go there you can take
that

207
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,440
anyway yard imminent hinged a

208
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,990
so in this case I said in England of me

209
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,650
2009 the article called jerusalem

210
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,920
much traffic wasn't getting that 3,000
and 5,000

211
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,520
its three-day so articles only get one
to you it's me there's zero

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,880
so that the man to track here's last
know what her

213
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,780
readers at wikipedia: looking for this
is showing different languages so from

214
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,300
the left VM English

215
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Chinese Japanese French German Russian
Spanish

216
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,790
and hiii

217
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,250
HIAS you

218
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,250
maybe okay

219
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,450
so you can see for example that English
meet the Pierre

220
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,220
the biggest sections for pop culture
government's history culture

221
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,600
sex the Chinese Wikipedia

222
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,530
pop culture is being yes like history a
larger section people researching about

223
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,319
sex

224
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,350
I'm p.m. when you go to the japanese
here

225
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,040
well as other japanese big he is pop
culture

226
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,040
hell little insect hey I

227
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,140
French wine french-canadians the surgeon
dr.

228
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,620
pop culture culture history politics sex
they don't with Hitler

229
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,990
thats yeah your homework

230
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,150
yeah yeah

231
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,760
third in a row yeah so

232
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,939
the the year is a disagreement

233
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,940
I'm so glad initially media sell its a

234
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,740
someone does it and then right that and
this building was read

235
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,779
and then someone comes in the change
here said

236
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,540
blue house red split so there now what's
called

237
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,498
remembered war and there are some

238
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:22,709
policies only 2 p.m. is what it's called

239
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,810
reliever rule if you the bird the same
article

240
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,638
to something three times in 24 hours you
block from the project no questions

241
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,110
it's a sharp right why so sometimes

242
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,170
experience members you need only rang
twice and

243
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,628
can get together and talk about this
with more than three times you may be

244
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,120
blocked release 24 hours sometimes
longer

245
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,819
let's say that you have a couple people
when they're not

246
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:51,620
finding a compromise do not find a
middle ground

247
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,730
well there there's no ruling body on the
project it's going to say this is the

248
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,410
way Dr

249
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,589
should be stead when he called you words
is

250
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,850
by census members the project we're
working on it

251
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,959
expectations include day

252
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,128
and trying to find a way out right in
the yard

253
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:14,769
that is acceptable to everyone was an
active interest in the article at that

254
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,319
time

255
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,399
and so the articles are not

256
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,579
has been written for one point more
points

257
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:23,979
this was taken mutual

258
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,560
shows reflect different who's out there
than once

259
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,149
it's a policy called way neutrality
there's multiple views

260
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,519
topic that we could hear should be
represent all these

261
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,699
significant use in the proper portion

262
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,000
how they were presented at mainstream
culture yet

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,290
week he says black web publishers say

264
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,509
and not read in with him it

265
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,800
Sun editors they still don't agree on it
the through

266
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,319
request comment they can the Asian

267
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,269
but they still can happen and it's
becoming disruptive

268
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,019
project his there's much angst in the
second half

269
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,170
here intellectual highest level

270
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,540
review just called arbitration this is

271
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,660
our current is several members community
who are elected

272
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,139
annual

273
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,350
they're all cheers and

274
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,690
it's a very tight and tense process they
serve

275
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,220
terms would be when she three years and

276
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,100
they hitting yet will not be deciding
how

277
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,040
art should be read they're only going to
look at the behavior

278
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,709
editors and Paul so in for example
there's

279
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,469
radical toppled a years 20 editors

280
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,940
were today like to achieve these goals a

281
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,529
are all 28 these editors discussing
things im

282
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,470
Bay are they open to compromise a opened
a consensus

283
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,930
usually worst case is going to be three
editors in there

284
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,699
were not at one point of view and that's
what they are and saying I don't care

285
00:16:58,699 --> 00:16:59,939
what anybody else says

286
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,480
so I'm time when they say okay he said
owners are now no longer allow it

287
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,579
in this topic here for period of time

288
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,938
sometimes hermana gotten off that's all
that's needed to take out a couple dozen

289
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,309
others were not open

290
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,949
compromise and then the rest and can
work together to craft

291
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:17,580
something

292
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:24,579
more on last users

293
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,639
yes example cases coming up

294
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:33,120
all so recently closed cases cited

295
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,459
old was women's topic areas I'll

296
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,529
West Bay Judea and Samaria

297
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm southern cases that have come to
anything

298
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,710
you Easter your sup hot spot justices

299
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,809
real-world I didn't you with paranormal
phenomena

300
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,240
science cold fusion was at the top

301
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,730
for a while and the areas where people
can have a very strong opinions

302
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,970
and they're not very interested
discussing things

303
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,970
and a a way that

304
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,340
census often has are come take a look at
it but now our content

305
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,480
designate certain areas as and
understanding that there are hot spots

306
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,460
anything to do with these your and
authorize the administrators Begbies

307
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,070
itself K goin' use call discretionary
sanctions

308
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,689
so I could go to an article that I could
see they've been getting injured

309
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,970
six months about this I see what you and
others that don't appear to be arguing

310
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,320
and

311
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,999
pay warning them if they ignore the
warnings that I have the authority

312
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,549
to remove them there's a lot of
oversight they're usually a lot

313
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:46,920
angst but it is something administrator

314
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
another way community communicates

324
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,799

people skills in their wisdom

people who are on

328
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,080

time-tested

329
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,360
EDSA administrators this

by gender singing email age

333
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,190
and school level education

334
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,000
so PHD's there are some people his
masters with primary there's a large

335
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
their primary school educated

336
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,590
that that

337
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,540
he wants the articles that are in this
you

338
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,629
the reserves last cycle range that would

339
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,130
lists articles that were in these rapid
fire even worse

340
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,360
anything in the ministry

341
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,360
want to be with him yeah

342
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,310
so if you want to edit Friday

343
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,960
one person say do say creating music
page you like rain again

344
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,620
and building that works with me PN
syndicate which affects your interest in

345
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,479
the editing

346
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,310
and hope it out and I'll necessarily
jump into a hotly contested art

347
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,679
at their school studies them behind the
scenes

348
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,780
their yard texas leads clean up some
things

349
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,360
form and right a disambiguation page has
been

350
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,959
created in some weird way or someone
came on creating an article that said

351
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,879
achieved

352
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:25,449
to dad I was the 1400 head

353
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,289
this track this is worse but they didn't
all they needed

354
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,369
for managers cool checks there so we are
the

355
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,738
leaving because it looks like I files in
our

356
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:39,019
really needs another editor to go in the
mop bucket

357
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,559
to go me that but in general

358
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,749
watch editor well the ball

359
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:48,979
as they say worst that can happen is
that someone remembers

360
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,590
yet but how will not get in trouble

361
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,959
for putting something in the bay think
it's very very

362
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,460
that the best way to keep from being
recruited is to cite your sources

363
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,450
so you want to purchasing creation

364
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,549
yeah I'm using star source yet a book

365
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,979
a people publisher passengers

366
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:15,729
Press home York Times

367
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:19,179
an article time magazine fine if
actually in there

368
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:22,460
they things and then using packing find
placements

369
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,710
we could be going added sorry that we
didn't have AAA

370
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,239
here's the source source here times made

371
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,490
19

372
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,700
acid wage negligent that it is very
unlikely that it will be remembered

373
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,039
possible as you like but

374
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,940
likely that I'll stay this talk here was
originally supposed to your shop

375
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,580
so the instructions for handling house
if anybody wants you edit Wikipedia

376
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,678
article

377
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,870
or they want my help you have been

378
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,409
format i'm happy to help at the park so

379
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,679
in general and people see something
wrong exit

380
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,730
for you the source if you see something

381
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,190
I'm source that you want to remove if
you it's really well

382
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,130
is just ahead you yea and there's no
obvious source there

383
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,080
and tagged with a fact jack it there is
a source there and you still think it's

384
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,480
mom look at that source best source

385
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,780
is it from I'm sorry University Press
well

386
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,629
it's getting very difficult

387
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,260
mood here without some sort session just
the housing University Press almost

388
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,140
racked but what you might like this one
some other source that says

389
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,100
okay this is wrong and then you can
remove it and say oh can change people's

390
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,530
lives

391
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,790
all are you going to say well this house

392
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,190
Yahoo in Jackson University Press this
house thread

393
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,340
according to Cambridge University Press
the houses look

394
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,010
and that we both viewpoints represented
worst

395
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,170
exception here

396
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,290
is renard them as handling person

397
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,050
years in here highly-respected policy
he'll

398
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm is lingers see something that as
well

399
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,280
incorrect you don't need to go through
hoops yes

400
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,470
and all you need to discuss the edit
summary

401
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,000
be am

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,030
loans tension no then sense

403
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,350
he's an attention is the only is like
the third rail someone goes it rehabs

404
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,350
incorrect information to a biography
lingers in the air how you block

405
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,639
project really fast in

406
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,660
you have an article about yourself it's
missing information

407
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,050
it's really simple rebirth here company
you work for

408
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,280
it's probably okay because here say

409
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,310
things talk paging Dr Jose

410
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,409
here's information she added this
article your sources for

411
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,500
maybe other editors do it maybe they
want well

412
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,380
sometimes I there's an article that no
p.m. sometimes

413
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,400
the talk page said this is rockets and
change it

414
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,980
you launch a wait six months or so and
I'll

415
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,170
right on track the article userspace

416
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,300
I'll go to another editor saying you
please happy

417
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,419
is correct draft place they are

418
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,440
you do it that happening

419
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,780
that way I can get injured so motion

420
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,950
just changing everything's their spring

421
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,620
if you're using on the project you
exactly

422
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,590
yes %um comes at the rivers you somebody
calls

423
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,620
me something stay calm

424
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,209
there mechanisms to deal with what we
tell people

425
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,380
is focus on the talk page and discuss
the article

426
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,010
not other editors this which is what you
make it

427
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,010
this you spiral his

428
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,150
at home pass organisms as are

429
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,160

430
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,370
cite sources say will house three days

433
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,959
also need you sources you used my

434
