1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,920
so um as isn't tonight

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,338
I kinda just want to share my personal
experiences with 3d printers

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:13,870
a which are not all incredibly positive
but I have had some good times

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,560
3-pointers I'm I hope that this talk can
be kinder than in between between

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,430
very pessimistic and very optimistic
however personally I believe the media

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,300
has been

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,400
entirely a little too optimistic a and

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,009
my goals maybe shed some light on
limitations

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,010
and realism around three printers but

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,659
we'll see how we do so

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,039
basically I talk a little bit about
myself the invention studio

12
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,600
hours really place that I'm involved
with

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,579
my experience 3-pointer as how I think
they're terrible

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,199
some common misconceptions about three
factors

15
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,940
things that they're actually good at and
then where I think 3d printing is

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,218
heading in the future

17
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,600
I am possibly future we're not all
around

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,039
has three times tell us all of them
become Santana

19
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,170
started their own society I that allow
some time with you name

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,259
leave but again feel free to ask
questions during the talk

21
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:17,119
so I'm chat I

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,470
like building things sometimes that
involves nuclear reactors sometimes that

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,860
involves three different things
sometimes that involves race cars

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,590
I like to have a good time I'll and

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,360
I am a senior in computer science at the
protections

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,259
her Trojans new technology I and
currently the president

27
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,539
your second CEO Ken months for talk
about that in just a second

28
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,610
and and but through little free time I
have I also do some research

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,390
and you don't want rahman so yeah and
this is basically a short overview video

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,119
about

31
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,679
the interest you does a really good job
showing what we're all about

32
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,179
a in a general sense we r

33
00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:01,140
a by student for student machine shops I
factor space

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,330
at Georgia Tech which is really nice
because we get to respect money

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,350
to do normal hackerspace things we have
lotsa

36
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,239
really awesome machines and many many 3d
printers

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,310
that's where I got a lot of my
experience from but

38
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,930
you a general idea who we are and what
we're all about go ahead

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,080
sure yet

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,970
this

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,090
the

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,260
that

43
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,890
the

44
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,309
his Sedo is this magical place

45
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,760
where they had basically every tool that
you could possibly want to build

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,329
something

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,260
and most to them our schools that no
person could ever possibly afford

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,030
what we're doing here is actually with
you not just for her

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,390
foot everywhere world teaching ourselves
and teach each other

50
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,540
pancreatitis or collaborative
environment where

51
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,820
knowledge was really easy to help Rishi

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,269
mold huge really much for this

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,380
maker greater hacker culture home

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,400
wall adding 10 she is

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,760
in one real she'll had a five-game

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,489
and questioning chal funny

57
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,370
years old you miss you running we're
sure that all

58
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,480
see for are met I don't like the taste

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,739
head around by people coming in

60
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,150
I making used

61
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,680
shoes Dutch like City

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,730
Channelside changed biomedical engineers

63
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,260
all these together 290 you

64
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,090
we did a nice

65
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,300
there's a really hope he will hear that
some really crazy him

66
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,610
paying out they days fairly page

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,160
particulates sorry I'm working on
improving my alibi

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,500
you don't play a round of meetings
injection by I'll

69
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,940
yes good time I'm right now

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,940
an experimental model aircraft amor up
50 kilogram solid him in his studio

71
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,049
open and available posted it was not
funny

72
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,150
that any Huntsville I tears sponsors

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,489
as well as the tech PT great need

74
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,610
its have a whole and homebuilding

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,680
dedicated to the ATL you pay

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,030
and me make your living it

77
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,190
hehe nations

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,280
so this is made about a year ago since
we've got another room we have about

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,010
I E student volunteers now and about
fifteen hundred

80
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,260
students and researchers that come
through on a monthly basis

81
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,700
'em and again it's all entirely
student-run

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,750
a which is really need because you get
to come into the images you doin work on

83
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,430
something with another student hoping
you are not necessarily some machinist

84
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,230
has been around for forever and it's
gonna

85
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,200
look over your shoulder the entire time
and tell you everything that we're doing

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,070
wrong researchers there today

87
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,630
you know what you and tell you to use
clamps or that hey don't do that are you

88
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,909
gonna cut your finger off

89
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,590
basic things and then everything else is
up to you as a student

90
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,320
you basically have free rein over
whatever you want to use sorry I can't

91
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,590
figure out how to get this to backfill
screams

92
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,679
this a like the

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,490
the other thing that goes along with us
means you can't run is that

94
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,540
we have students fix and maintain all
our machines

95
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,290
and I took responsibility it last year
maintaining all over 3d printers

96
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,680
which basically resulted in me spinning
about 40 hours a week

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,850
and are backroom approaches dislike
basement room with

98
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,550
know when does a some new natural
sunlight

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,290
it's like the three printer cave just
surrounded by broken 3d printers every

100
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:03,750
day

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,270
and you having to work on them all the
time so a lot of my eye

102
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,090
views expressed in this presentation are
kind of a result of that year

103
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,989
living among the three pointers and
working on them every day

104
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,650
but basically we have three different
reasons to you because we think they are

105
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,719
all developing technology imposes on
developing technology

106
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,050
they certainly come are really only way
in like the past five years or so

107
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,050
and I think they still have a really
long way to go progression is fairly

108
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,470
quick

109
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,700
in the industry no is really big right
now but we like to have

110
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,219
3-pointers as a rapid prototyping
technology and I think that

111
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,140
again imposition be placed on on those
words this is these are going to take

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,830
aways

113
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,419
up the entire presentation as far as
what I think people

114
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,410
should understand about 3-pointers they
are rapid prototyping technology

115
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,570
on very good for prototyping things not
necessarily as much

116
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,719
for finished products and we can talk
about that

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,990
more detail throughout the presentation
sometimes they're acceptable for sure on

118
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,270
manufacturing like for instance if
you're doing a

119
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,830
classic case for your raspberry hire
someone like you

120
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,020
that you have it custom Raspberry Pi
router something like that

121
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,460
you're only making 10 of the prototype
for Kickstarter as examples well and

122
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,030
their keys and that I'm they're good for
bespoke parts as well and there are a

123
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,859
lot of companies

124
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,169
now they're kinda popular make you a
custom bracelets and things like that

125
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,359
swatches that from thing that

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,919
3d printing has brought to the
marketplace that not many other fab

127
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,409
shops are able to do

128
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,729
and economic fashion I and

129
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,740
since their additive manufacturing you
get to see a lot of material

130
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,789
and we also drawing a lot non

131
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,759
engineering students into machine shop
and you know once they get tired

132
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,470
for you printing we can say oh so now
that you're in the machine shop

133
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,820
even though you're a liberal arts major
you should also learn how to

134
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,210
users emails and water jet and laser
cutters and we get to turn this

135
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,340
literature major

136
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,380
it was initially interested in 3d
printing into a badass machinist at the

137
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,349
end the day which is

138
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,039
really cool p and it's it's really
awesome to see a bunch of electrical

139
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,680
engineers and

140
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,370
biomedical engineering students are the
board's people come out no

141
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,720
Georgia Tech with not only agree and
whatever their fielders but also at

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,650
one show machine experience which allow
them to go into the industry has two

143
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,190
manufacturing knowledge as well

144
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,490
as far as common materials we deal
mostly with

145
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,610
a FTM style 3d printing which I

146
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,090
should probably talk about first so
there are several different flavors

147
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,380
3d printing a FTM is called fused
deposition

148
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,260
modeling and had the chance to meet the
guy who

149
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,480
initially made patents for at the M&M
Aston you know how did you come up with

150
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,330
this idea and said well my daughter has
plastic frogs

151
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,220
toy that broke one night and I just
wanted to make another one in house

152
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,240
so I grabbed a hot glue gun and I just

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,360
I mean there's and the corresponding
shape wrong until I had a hundred

154
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,280
players piled up

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,839
that resemble frock and realize I can't
take this hot glue gun

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,230
and stratigraphy lauter and then

157
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,210
but as the axis of water so move up and
down and

158
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,950
then he got his first himself printer
now he owns

159
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,470
stresses corporation which is probably
one of the largest

160
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,290
industrial create 3d printing companies
in the world which is pretty neat

161
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,980
but FDM also happens to these are the
cheapest

162
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,050
consumer re printers I usually use

163
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,199
site says ABS or

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,350
by lactic acid P L E which are two you
throw by six that are fairly common in

165
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,420
industry for instance ABS is the pot

166
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,370
plastic that like you or me upset its
everywhere it's pretty easy to work with

167
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,370
they have different yessir structural
qualities for instance

168
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,570
ABS tends to shrink as it cools down
really is a little easier to deal with

169
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,700
he didn't know platform but we've got to
play around with all these different

170
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,220
materials here yes indeed filaments now
they're actually like a

171
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,710
wooden pole composite thats lol oxy that
you can help

172
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,530
like 301 part which is Brittany or ninja
flex

173
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,400
we've actually had a couple students
come into the emergency view and print

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,189
shoes

175
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,520
other your flights which end up not last
very long but it's cool to see apart

176
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,079
that was you may before you in real time
you can put on your but

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,210
walk across campus in so that's pretty

178
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,770
up there also is your love are here as
only and selective laser sintering

179
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,390
SLs RSL and offers withheld

180
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,319
and easily and as a less machines are
usually much more expensive we have a

181
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
couple of them

182
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,880
for instance we just got form one
printer which is as a less

183
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,150
and basically as a photopolymer resin
has a light on the bottom in

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,010
you essentially shine a light on to the
photopolymer resin Amberlite

185
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,130
his put upon resin Orton's and what that
allows you to do is make a much

186
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,220
more detailed are and FDM typically you

187
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm so as an FTM is basically like
taking a cock

188
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,819
gonna laying down and layers into you
have an entire part

189
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,030
Houston disadvantage for this though is

190
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,540
what we say is a and I tried and
isotropic

191
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,930
a structural qualities are you part mean
that a

192
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,069
with laying down a part layer by layer
sometimes you don't necessarily have a

193
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,720
uniform

194
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,200
fusion from where to where so what that
means in essence is that

195
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,730
most reprinted parts are not very
structurally sound so you wouldn't want

196
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,120
to me

197
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,410
a steering linkage or I

198
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,140
you know something that your life is
going to depend on more a lot of mass is

199
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,020
going to

200
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,220
impact itself on from reprinting as you
have here is a far better better bond

201
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,120
and others

202
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,550
and sometimes that results in apartments
really strong in one area and not so

203
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,779
strong in other areas

204
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,689
us a there are many design
considerations that must be answered

205
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,230
taken into account when you're reprints
& that's just one of them thats

206
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,930
particularly limited for limiting

207
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,410
and Afghan style manufacturing so I just
to give you a rundown of

208
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,689
are fleet and one printers I had an
experience with

209
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm have a whole lot I'll

210
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,100
jewels was a while once we have three
rebel here to use one of which

211
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,770
I have gotten the other room it did a
particularly

212
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,100
great job demonstrate my point why 3d
printers are aggravating last night

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,050
about like six of us that around the
printer for about an hour trying

214
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,449
it for you runs continually watch
electrically

215
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,810
we also have a a bunch of me such a
really nice if you look at the Army's

216
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,329
hair looks like a up stresses that
mention they're all nice includes of

217
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:47,989
this is like something you can see here

218
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,110
using the Site or computer kinda looking
at home next year

219
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,440
PC tower its nice because all-in-one
boxes and clothes off which means that

220
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,579
the entire bill

221
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,880
volume as he did I like I mentioned
earlier he s actually shrink somewhere

222
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,439
between

223
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,740
three in 6 percent as it cools down so
you kinda have to close the entire

224
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,110
of and and if you don't you have you

225
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,910
subject to air currents which can flow
through the bill

226
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,029
volume all your friends in ensuring
certain parts the

227
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,100
French for other arts the print new

228
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,230
and up not form parts which is kinda
cool there is sometimes

229
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,980
on the low slot passes are also EDS
procedures with you to build platforms

230
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,550
but they do not have any

231
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,670
enclosure so they're often subject to

232
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,459
water problems we also have a buncha
each series

233
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,529
an up close to use which are like the
older brothers

234
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,530
the up knees now we have all these and
he did in poachers which is really nice

235
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,540
have a couple of type a serious ones
which are absent usually

236
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,550
pela a and here just to give you our

237
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,319
and appreciation how quickly things
change in

238
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,050
shin studio he hides a modified version
of this talk at Dragon Con this year

239
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,540
and when that talk was nearing are ever
here to use were alive

240
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,569
our series ones printers were alive art
as is where I live and our

241
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,550
you wanna ones were alive evolve into
their misery now

242
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,420
I and serve taken away for other
projects and

243
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,860
important transformed into more useful
things but

244
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,380
at the same time we're starting to grow
really rapidly in the number three

245
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,280
countries we have we have about thirty

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,589
now all in one big ramzi walk in and do
whatever you want on

247
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,370
but that's already includes mostly FTM
printers

248
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,890
up many is the thing is rapidGator CA
teens

249
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,530
and the dimensions are all at the ends
and the form I for one am

250
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,880
the object are SLs printers which you
really high resolution sup

251
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,380
so as far as lying to you under their
care or

252
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,510
up this is my favorite YouTube videos
and

253
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,970
it's kind of like encapsulates just
about everything that's frustrating

254
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,040
300 so like is happening here

255
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,209
a this printer is supposed to be frontin

256
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,670
I a a a Raspberry Pi case for his

257
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,030
basically some simple rectangles and %uh

258
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,970
instead decided to make this ball love
just wasted

259
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,970
hopes and dreams hey

260
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,130
I'm and I was talking to Alan

261
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,990
up there earlier from resentment right
down the street from four second-half

262
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,460
couple 3-pointers as well and really
3-pointers as

263
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,660
this you have so many variables to you

264
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,020
take into account the operation as
machine so you have all of the UN your

265
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,240
motion components

266
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
you have severs have linear slides
bearings

267
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,780
belts I and several owners you have all
the electronics and wiring harnesses

268
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,800
that go to the Sabers from

269
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,329
the controllers yet controllers and
sells alls

270
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,560
motor controllers that can blow up
mother or which is basically a fancier

271
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,219
we know which is not really meant for
your production products and

272
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,570
my opinion and then you also have a hard
time like

273
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,890
so sort of all hot glue gun

274
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,029
with your machine filming through it
like email years

275
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,489
this I'm

276
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:27,859
reason a and

277
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:30,949
at really hot temperatures so

278
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,179
the late Princess 230 degrees Celsius
and

279
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,509
this %uh temperature control is done for
a PA

280
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:41,649
you move on the Arduino that could
engineered by someone who hasn't

281
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,879
sorry license control or anything like
that so objected temperature

282
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,889
fluctuations

283
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,290
and basically at the end of the day you
get a sheen that is

284
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,179
relying on like lock to you work
properly

285
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,319
up because you have so many things that
are subject to failure that were

286
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:57,979
designed

287
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,439
not necessarily by engineers and all
have to work together

288
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:07,379
you're perfectly well to get a reprinted
part at the end of the day

289
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,519
a anytime you get like a new filament
we're trying to do something that's

290
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,679
pushing the limitations a 3-pointer

291
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,209
you need to change that means and ones
any changes

292
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,720
one small mujhe a change can that's the
effect our printer is operating as a

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,159
whole

294
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:27,380
as a as Online Services Limited as it is
it's hard to see what one

295
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,250
change in one very well might make an

296
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,510
operation printer as a whole and yeah

297
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,530
halfway through are and it fails and
wasted

298
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,830
half of small the LA for Virgin Mobile
Intel platform

299
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm so they're they're all sorts of
things that can go wrong and

300
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,260
well I often tell people as well as that
in the invention studio is not

301
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,350
necessarily always the printers that are
at fault

302
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,510
it's a I have that there in the
inventions you I think most actors faces

303
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,240
will tell you this is well

304
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,840
when you have an environment where you
have a a hundred machines there's

305
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,860
open for anyone to walk in and use a we
don't allow that

306
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,418
arsons emails and waters and things like
that as people think

307
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,130
cut off their arms and you die world s

308
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,390
using those machines three vendors are
kinda cute and I'm gonna kill you

309
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,489
unless you're very very agreeable

310
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,399
a be kind of awareness see but

311
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,090
anyways a we we we allow our three
countries we have in a separate room

312
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,199
that's open

313
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,169
any time ru you always have that room
because we trust that He user

314
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,889
you know and and rule how to use Rangers
we have internal Wii that documents

315
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,330
house use all our printers

316
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,678
and since we have university funding and

317
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,330
have money to replace printers like once
every year

318
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,100
and we whole for you brokers and service
subject them to the masses and hope they

319
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,769
do well

320
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,220
up which is probably not the best
telling you to manage

321
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,580
Sheree by however with 3-pointers as the
relatively cheap

322
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,600
that allows us to man-hours to other
places

323
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,090
allowed like sees you wanted to make
sure people are cutting their arms of

324
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,730
a because I would be really bad 300
going down

325
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,960
necessary a statement issued by you
require

326
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,549
a have a good experience and knowledge
to think okay well I but this difference

327
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,730
filament and I ADSL menendez going to
the net for ples

328
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,730
Lionel and takes two hours to unblock
nasa by someone who has issues with a

329
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,559
3-pointer

330
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,750
and can just call a lot of aggravation
especially like one pounds at some time

331
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,490
something fails and if you are an
experienced user

332
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,570
not everyone can walk up to $300,000
well

333
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,530
the platform wasn't level or future was
not high enough so

334
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,629
without the proper expertise these
things

335
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:55,630
India real us neighbor

336
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,290
us as a couple other a collect samples

337
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,559
there has actually been I i'm happy
about this

338
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,340
a certain new former the chart that 3d
printers have

339
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,178
us on and their official website is now
that you can this be willing to fail

340
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,470
reprints and people I was like okay

341
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,160
this is what this part was opposed to
the and said I got this too small

342
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,200
or I'm this part here if you remember
back to the openings like a rat

343
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,910
here you on fire this is actually one of
their

344
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,919
sample parts that comes with the printer

345
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,919
a you would think that printer will be
able to properly

346
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,710
right now this one has me a message
itself I'll

347
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,020
all game yeah it's

348
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,168
it would be very there %uh same thing
goes with this

349
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:50,480
a this replicator one

350
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,010
on on the right inside I actually know

351
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,460
Wisconsin on that one is huge mess %uh

352
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,090
we also had a the pressure I have been

353
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,199
the sorry conference room on call

354
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,280
you walk has error where the

355
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,370
wires on the x-axis ever motor were not
properly strain relief

356
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,800
so when that wiring harness our dish or
al

357
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,879
he's ever motor with CSS which would
result in

358
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,370
maybe five or ten layers your parties
act of homage

359
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,719
itself like it sure then and then it was
our TV sets and you have

360
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,270
no nice art and then diagonally printed

361
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,270
resident parts or all one side missus
and where it's easy as well

362
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,450
and one thing I can see forever he
refused had a personal experiences that

363
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,540
they're incredibly consistent in their
failures a

364
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,159
services we had brief them we got to
wash you what happened and see diagonal

365
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,890
parts and

366
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,160
and all laugh use an and then when

367
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,900
or other cuban leaders a of political

368
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,720
a they were named after for resource
characters

369
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,540
not much of a is race

370
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,020
was yes we had what he and the year

371
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,389
levels small guys a all yeah

372
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:14,100
so Louis and agile also at the same
issues down the road when they came up

373
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,330
to about the same

374
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,780
aren't hours a which was kinda areas

375
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,549
and its i think is a little bit about
their engineering Palace

376
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,690
to say that while they had this failure
that should have been his neighbor

377
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,890
prevented by using proper wires and
promising

378
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,200
techniques but at least all unveiled at
the same time

379
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,669
and you never /param I'm the under you
what I have in your room

380
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,880
take a look at and see all different
parts that we had climbing harnesses

381
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,180
make our own

382
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,930
pictures and things like that it's been
pretty interesting

383
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,020
practical during exercise forced after

384
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,320
girl since you're basically you learn as
we go

385
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,600
everybody else's and

386
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,520
so well I learned very quickly is that
managing

387
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,120
33 ranchers is not as easy as it may
sound

388
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,449
a.m. you think a living Martin can sell

389
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,110
Iran's fairly similar meaning buys it
into a heated pool and

390
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,229
more buses coming out in ages moves
around

391
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,730
miles more than possible on top itself
you know good

392
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,920
on so that s very difficult

393
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,940
a and your have to keep up with the

394
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,410
capabilities so for instance you never
know from hazardous material all of

395
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,030
these units are going to be working on
one semester I have a lot of Mechanical

396
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,570
Engineers your intent with

397
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,919
well I just wanna make a plea personals
and for

398
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,130
possible racket and the next master you
might have a launcher

399
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,050
him he's coming

400
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,290
in I medical engineers want to make a
you're realistic models

401
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,370
neurons or something has to be area high
precision

402
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,129
and I'm then you know educating your
entire user base to

403
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,600
it is the ramsey is walking in from day
to day on how to use 3-pointers

404
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,580
and and the living without having to
sell your soul to

405
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,669
300 this lines you and

406
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,730
so we all need every vendor master so
your

407
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,120
voted in by the Executive Council that
runs the emergency

408
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,639
you know and and you comes on small for
managing

409
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,090
are three printers and then for your
lifetime

410
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,790
you which is usually year in terms of
how long your song

411
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,070
for a whole year is crap from everyone
else

412
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,409
as wire 3-pointers run resistant
materials

413
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,050
exhortation cell a so these are all
things that I

414
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,440
I would imagine anyone who hasn't
returned your will

415
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,330
experience on uses up

416
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,710
now on june the positive section up talk

417
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,440
a I will point to Ponce

418
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,700
were a lot more really really great
examples hell

419
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,360
3-pointers use for doing awesome self
one thing is a Swedish supercar

420
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,490
back here and he's a roommate best

421
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,860
scars and

422
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,260
they only make about $6 to $10 him all

423
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,500
which means that you're going very
limited reductions

424
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,010
which means that regarding reliable
solutions for manufacturing really

425
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,440
interesting crazy arts reasons is
turbocharger has variable

426
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,890
gains on the inside his house in and is
currently using

427
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,309
as a less active leases in dream machine
IIT Moss Side

428
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,450
how services or like year

429
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,179
CVR that'll 329 they've done several

430
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,990
Arts on their race car which is all 121
out attacking

431
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,230
marks is actually a three hundred
companies million assault on this forum

432
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,200
per worker housing as well as all the
exhaust manifold

433
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,299
different their entire exhaust manifold
from the headers you the modeler

434
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,309
and catalytic converter everything in
one go on 3-pointers

435
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,639
since their own incident

436
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,160
what time it's he's with actual you that
but II was Friday

437
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,210
examples people you know doing a
four-run

438
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,500
a Raspberry Pi cases on 3-pointers

439
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,130
reliable you could do the same thing on
injection molder

440
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,330
uses email

441
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,908
on Maciel miss turned parts out all day
long injection molder never had any

442
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:24,200
reliability issues I'm whereas time you
thousands and thousands parts

443
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,490
andl on 3-pointers bird well

444
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,720
from what we now Syrians

445
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,809
I and II any earlier our site he praises

446
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:38,440
things like that people like me like
we're planters small planes

447
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,260
we're on the neck or jewelry and things
like that 300 with

448
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,840
and production on ross good a

449
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,939
as far as what you've done around studio

450
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,809
this was up every minute going on are

451
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,059
as is his of people from the nation's
heroes and her friends from NYC

452
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,408
immigrant you know

453
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,289
new car was friends and I'm

454
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,649
up so this is a Daft Punk helmet that I

455
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,918
remanded I and looking like he refuses

456
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,539
3-pointers actually for of making some
delays in a lot more detail are slow

457
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,039
hand

458
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,930
there are a lot of really awesome
partners around

459
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,450
use from

460
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,550
fiberglass on same for

461
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,180
weeks and then me for months have a
really nice

462
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,850
part I found I 3 back something we can
be done and

463
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,620
another couple use mine is having an
last which is like it

464
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,969
on he'll up

465
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,850
also reactor Iron Man stern

466
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,469
so we also use the vendors for
engineering

467
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,780
yes this them along with that

468
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,030
actually a whale act that for Nini
vernell

469
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,639
a so basically and the black box are

470
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,340
on electronics

471
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,860
runners and

472
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,320
I am news

473
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,600
at No ship to log data and basically
what he is insanely it sitting on the

474
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,939
back

475
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,489
whale and Andrew release itself after a
few weeks

476
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,269
has on certain marine species particular

477
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,929
million species you can't leave electron
surtax on

478
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,539
from work certain Sam time he's

479
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:25,940
Dr Wales meets you reliable mechanism

480
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,730
he's in Tagajo whale in a hanger and

481
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,100
Casey soyuz 300 to make

482
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,509
alleles and this is the birthplace they
are all signs

483
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:39,960
me injection molded later on al

484
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,869
here in this case is abso- euros are on
the inside

485
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,499
and several more his water nice 0

486
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:50,529
as water

487
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,519
I cases back in form

488
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,250
which is another room

489
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,269
he as a backend miles and

490
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,620
services he's

491
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,780
yeah as it out yet to its going to
Iceland in July

492
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,800
seller as on back whale

493
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,530
is also pretty cool example

494
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,120
here said that was actually all in one
go

495
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,300
300 near yeah any

496
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,169
yes message size

497
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:32,170
space

498
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,380
my ass

499
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,210
a

500
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,559
no I rely heavily on

501
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,059
seen it burns and cuming outside

502
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:57,059
the walls

503
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,960
also as we all know from the video I
show they're here

504
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,540
making power losses fairly common ground

505
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,240
CEO and back in town that weekend revert

506
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,330
the higher in terms about a lot and then
just screw

507
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,810
a hardened tools you'll the outside and

508
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,010
so the their last seven for

509
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,790
with like for instance ABS is very
high-impact

510
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,629
isn't satire frames printed out ATS

511
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,670
and his return is certainly their

512
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,260
transparent and one go and then all you
have to do is

513
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,220
all outside army the me but write-ins

514
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,380
sorry and I'm credits her mind you know

515
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,280
right answer and United art unions

516
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,399
through Martin CEO of the Health Science

517
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,910
pretty resilient I which is really needs
it a lot of time

518
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,930
manufacturing strongly you decides email

519
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,920
with a couple weeks you design
department at

520
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,470
mall can work

521
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,039
roles long she in biology tools three
friends in

522
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,269
cheeser corruption and of course we've
also done some

523
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,440
figurines me a chess set sir the

524
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,639
just figurines the clear Prince

525
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,939
is actually an example like print from
our phone last machine it was a

526
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,770
solutions really are feeds them

527
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,840
resident these guys doing an issue

528
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,030
layers Prince themselves there's a long

529
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,230
the hi apart where the

530
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,520
separation how it's been president

531
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,690
will bring down and print more so

532
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,710
that's an example areas where from

533
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,090
separations between the Slayers and
that's also something and no

534
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,709
and service call you reprints are not
always you perfectly smooth after

535
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,850
they've been printed soviet take that
into account for making

536
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,230
rock something that you want to be her
with smooth not gonna come out

537
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,129
country like you

538
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,360
finish

539
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,639
we also have a people for you printer
which is

540
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,399
really need I am going back to like what
I see backing

541
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,870
earlier I had a couple experiments with

542
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,189
doing back in for me returns in C make
them all that's

543
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,950
me know pela and using them all but into
a vacuum forming machine which basically

544
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,070
it means using

545
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,330
she plastic 111 he's up to about 230
degrees Celsius

546
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,070
treatment over your part and then you
have packing along the bottom

547
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,870
that creates a seal between please and
classic you just read everything else i

548
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,939
plastic over your whole and then you
have

549
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,110
plastic piece that replicate fairly easy
to use

550
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,469
football then and

551
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,060
peace like five or 10 min

552
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,549
which is with me

553
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:55,100
for instance I'm making visors for my
using this method

554
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,490
with plae though appealing else around
210 degrees Celsius

555
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,720
so when you're drayton something over it
lets you like

556
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,010
30 degrees Celsius have what's melting
up your whole

557
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,110
wish comes up to you

558
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,729
partners new goods world weird ways

559
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,000
over our paper three hundred which has a
standard inkjet printer

560
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,630
in the bottom it's Casey you take off
I'll

561
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,669
in sql file with other 3d printers

562
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:26,120
it breaks it up into little all players
in the

563
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,219
brings out the color patterns this is
something you need to pay per view

564
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,929
hunter's well

565
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:35,900
imprint in full color so it will print
the outlines of the objects on sheet and

566
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,370
then

567
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,370
looking up I'll sheets and the side
pay-per-view manager

568
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,389
which then take them XML places them on
the bill

569
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,890
platform has a razor that goes around
comes along the edges and

570
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,799
who's on the next few paper and paper
part which is

571
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,990
more resistant to you a thermal

572
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,850
damages them delay these for instance
you can

573
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,399
papers we runs a vacuum forming more and
then

574
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,669
got into the 203 results is plastic and
not have to worry about nothing

575
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:12,540
Hillier ABS is

576
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,310
3 isn't connecting rod identifying

577
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,340
finite element analysis

578
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,429
PA yes that's an awesome yeah

579
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:27,119
you need not take this into a meeting
and say okay cited FDA in salwar

580
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,760
switches that basically I

581
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,399
stress is going through the park in
certain conditions experimental

582
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,040
conditions

583
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,830
million and say okay our stress
concentrations around the bottom up

584
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,270
connecting rod that would normally be
connected Trisha after

585
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,330
are no higher than we want them to be

586
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,989
and since this achievement is being
printed on paper you get to do this

587
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:51,520
for much less money with classic having
to swap out classic

588
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,520
every time one colors crazy for word

589
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,460
no so I would

590
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,200
be interesting I have seen people who
were transit like pneumatic motors

591
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,520
a and also people who have any pumps

592
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,800
that were 300 I'm well as far as doing
the more I i would have to the

593
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,570
you have to be able to get the economy
for ones and some house I guess you

594
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,340
could print like

595
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,020
the and also you have to have you know

596
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,220
a fair I Korres

597
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,970
their rights leaders in that's a secret
from my house in using plastic or

598
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,790
something like that

599
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:37,740
over me using malcolm's I'm actually
interesting project to try out I'm

600
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,129
I have printed I sure I'm a

601
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,510
airlines so basically like the first
half

602
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,000
up the Truong were on pay a turbocharger

603
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,310
the impellers action sectarian spits out

604
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,790
high-volume we were looking at trying to
make a

605
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,090
home for rocket motor do a high volume
of liquid

606
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,850
very very small amount of time so we're
essentially Designs Inc

607
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,130
he strapped to a three-phase brushless
DC motor

608
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,190
from the NRC airplanes had a couple 1000
rpm

609
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,520
and spend the impeller up inside cares
ruin it into the rocket motor

610
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,070
on leisure on San rocket engines use
like

611
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,120
REITs reactions drive turbine

612
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,710
we thought we might be able to get RC
great few days russians

613
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,380
think however skinny teenager going to
be up to

614
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,400
a couple 1000 rpm that has been
reprinting 300

615
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,650
on replicator choose a very good idea

616
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,900
definitely don't because one race

617
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,450
fortunately we have now since like put
it behind

618
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,598
early decade

619
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,440
are us your questions

620

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,800
or long-lasting yes so

626
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,190
I definitely would say instances arounds

studying

629
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,570
FDM technology is for trying to create
an eye tena have some older friends

630
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,390
we also work out together his
presentation at Dragon Con

631
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,670
thought okay money if people are
decision on what we think

632
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,380
mess three countries consumer market and
the army's

633
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,720
our decision you can buy these on Amazon
right now for about six hundred dollars

634
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,270
a pop

635
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,500
his life for all night long time
actually signing off for

636
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,710
for the Rangers substantial savings
which is why we didn't use the Print PBS

637
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,300
he the wall unit looks really nice and
very much

638
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,509
if a friend its roots version there you
know

639
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:05,449
the entire things replicator to use are

640
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,159
serve notorious and my expense for a
ninety-percent

641
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,470
are and then when you know

642
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,750
which I would much rather than from a
printer and have

643
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,010
the park panel on the first player like
three times because bill

644
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,710
platforms her law or something like that
that I would it ninety percent through

645
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,930
are and Happy Easter on and we sell

646
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,990
passing snow would be the development

647
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,009
many to different on

648
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,470
bag

649
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,160
your home all he's

650
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,578
you

651
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,540
yeah so also on the inside of this

652
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,420
all of the frame motion components are
made out of metal

653
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,839
making nice high precision %um
components

654
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,540
up a nigger officer date and I

655
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,020
said how can you produce this and she
has most marketable way

656
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,849
and then it's sacrifices for making it
look pretty and me

657
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:05,950
she which is still three times machines

658
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,410
however the the internal structure for
all

659
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,460
motion components they're all very
soundly now system at all

660
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,829
pieces see Harry you like place

661
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:20,630
were being home components inside
smitten and the

662
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,059
saw for Syrians use but it's the usual

663
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:29,119
control making lots of weirdos
temperature regulation is much better in

664
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,890
these jeans

665
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,920
this on me while yeah

666
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,869
this year

667
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:38,529
for a long time so

668
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:42,390
this is a four-and-a-half inch by 4 inch
I N chill

669
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,920
volume and sometimes you look at that
and say well as in Paris mommy

670
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,319
useful with that and I use the share of
people

671
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:55,089
I like design arts letters or modular
can be fastened together happily

672
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,490
I'm sewing presents a Master Chief
helmet was done

673
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:03,129
28 different parts and I'm very quickly
I wanted to do a or

674
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,470
print online rather interviews if they
don't mind you personally through

675
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,660
and a whole thing over again verses one
small part

676
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,640
feel was smaller in the other neat thing
that I can share your gonna

677
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,558
Hill pieces in my toolbox new room I

678
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,029
design polls and for I can answer

679
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:26,529
alignment ends assists the loss %um

680
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,109
ours shall

681
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:31,740
Jim seasons are designs and patterns

682
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,850
you margin artist have alignment ands

683
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,720
or us work

684
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,089
same or wish sir about it will matter

685
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:48,090
here's me want over

686
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,570
the radio reuse return %uh so I actually
found

687
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,270
Microsoft Kinect to be you just about as
good as anything else on the market

688
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,220
we happen to be easy maker bot with
digitizer

689
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,490
a and its a lower rubbish

690
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,330
I'll try to CNN chick-fil-a up with
digitizer

691
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,230
and it was looks like sons or law I'm

692
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,870
so the resolution is very very poor
digitizers we have here after lights

693
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,750
and was basically works by projecting a
image

694
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,250
simply like black and white lines years
takes a picture with a really high

695
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,670
resolution Cameron

696
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,250
measures that Russian the image that it
knows and softwares

697
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,029
through images okay

698
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:35,790
this is the warnings from

699
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,329
of here the name that works really well
have to you

700
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:44,619
repositioning object by every time if
you get off

701
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:45,840
agrees

702
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,420
its solvers seems that there is the

703
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,850
s Gabriel me with neckties his

704
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,130
Windows platforms size your own place

705
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,510
Mac here Windows down

706
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,670
their development platform and is people
the scanner

707
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,120
and his routed around object and
software

708
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,150
sure the mash on club session

709
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,000
you can then conferred

710
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,380
also if you are you next loss can
explain around download this offer

711
