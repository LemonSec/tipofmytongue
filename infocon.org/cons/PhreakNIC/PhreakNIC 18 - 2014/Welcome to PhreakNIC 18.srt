00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,140
a main event are and it was a way to try
out new ideas smaller

83
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,830

um obviously he were not in the
international room doing the talks

89
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,240
so I think gallup figure that out by now
all the talks were gonna happen here not

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
in the international room where we doing
registration because it's just too darn

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,570
small

92
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,880
and unfortunately our our glorious
leader founder of the National 2600

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,719
chapter back in the early 90's the
Atlanta chapter a few years later

99
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,840

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,270
I'm we've also a lot of people been
asking for hacker inside stickers we

106
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,640
have them there on the hacker stickers
desk they're free

107
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,150
the hacker stickers guy couldn't make it
down at the convention

108
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,799
his wife is expecting and she's
apparently had some complications last

113
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,900
stop at his own expense and sending it
here for free

114
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,900
one final point of clarification I was
dead sober when I did the coat this year

115
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,600
and I tested it many many many many many
times I've learned my lesson

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Wonka good

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,310
fifteen years ago was a different story
yaa

118
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,310
let's go get dinner I'm hungry hi guys

hill

124
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,530
but they say they don't really have
official meetings at this point

125
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,590
hopefully

126
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,260
um Freaknik will help generate enough
interesting revitalized the people on

127
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,719
the mailing list enough to start doing
physical meetings again

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,250

129
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,250
