1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,300
hello everyone I'll come back if you are
rather you richard Bennett

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,700
the go love this song willowy to

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,879
go over everything you need to know

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,090
%uh well basically he started on
everything you need to know to build

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,740
a you clear a parade is in your garage
or basement

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,360
yeah so it will be a

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,390
interesting of pleaded and

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,460
again if you have any questions feel
free to you would not reveal a

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,380
presentation

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,980
I yesterday humility

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,980
space hey so yeah

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,550
pretty cool that we had a talk
transfusion in space just beforehand

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,739
I certainly have a lot of interest in
the lab with the iPod speakers

14
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:56,830
for me so we can talk about potential
applications for space travel

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,059
routes presentation I definitely well
pretty much everything

16
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,110
presented here is not necessarily aimed
at

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,020
like you interstellar travel or
production it

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,440
more on as a learning exercise and you

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,910
I make me stop

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,990
which is why I said I got started with
all this

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,229
%uh this is what you have to slide on
your smartphone

22
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,759
then since you're going a I'm sure this
life

23
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,380
me but the slide up on that Britney a

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,750
website after this but %uh see if this
works it should

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,990
you will %ah pleaded that

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,310
buying place yeah

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,500
you all alone yeah

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,619
make think over everything

29
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:51,140
yeah

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,869
we

31
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,829
we have decided to use even try him on
this year and it was a

32
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,750
and all we did that did not have I a
projector

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,880
with really be thankful for the fact
that you are good because I handed it to

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
one person

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,940
and this in yes inning and everyone in
the room with smartphones and tablets

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,060
with presentations

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,440
are you lonesome

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,780
anyone had success with this is the sort
of thing with me

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,570
excellent also on that for slaughter

40
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,400
got my email address in my website my
website has a lot of contact information

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,550
for me so

42
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,730
I you have any questions or want to love
me or

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,579
a you don't reactor license something
like that a

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,570
for you you know me rights

45
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,470
period and a all numbers

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,540
I you didn't think you are going to just
get it from a neighbor

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,179
a so as 3 goes well see

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,110
up most of the time personally know I
can be your overall

49
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,680
did not feel it I used improperly I

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,030
film I

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,440
the mobile relations my my

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,550
or no a long story we can talk about it
later

53
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,740
a good icebreaker I'm well

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,980
so yeah I know your local

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,069
regulations for radiation

56
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,230
appliances X-rays things like that for
you only something always use discretion

57
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,890
on

58
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,100
how your advertising what you're doing
and so or

59
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,540
I'll fortunately most of the stuff that
I view this tournament with an AI

60
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,900
regime that is mostly the people and
whoever hears

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,100
up so if you were here earlier you never
know who I am and I'm a computer science

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,260
you network stack I like doing things
%uh

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,850
its thats wat u I actually I do happen

64
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,140
just like c'mon from my

65
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,589
even trippin but and president possibly
said

66
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,870
say probably means to you thank you
research former National Oceanic and

67
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,310
Atmospheric Association

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,220
and actually getting there today I'll
select

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,870
wrong I'm if you

70
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,090
if you didn't get his phone and talk
before or

71
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm you have it physics and while

72
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,790
this is basically a long as you continue
this talk a

73
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,950
essentially you know how I started all
this I I was really in the middle school

74
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,130
I started getting

75
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,710
an interest in doing atomic things I'm

76
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,299
and had very little this technology and
use this as an agonist

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,000
to teach myself you know electricity and
magnetism

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
radiation isn't all that and this is
really all you need to know

79
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,440
%uh there are adamant saying I suppose
and you can make them into

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,560
ions their from protons and electrons
and for all over this fall

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,800
pretty much hola mi Oracle physics that
we'll be doing is something wrong

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Tomic well or not so much cell on the
entrance

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,190
and you play a large part and while
things and stuff

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,200
no I'm the neat thing about atoms that
always mystified

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,920
yes someone said okay well we're doing
this Yemen

86
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,920
experimental are nuclear reactor and I i
think you know I was like getting well

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,900
hands are so small how are they actually
manipulate and the great thing is that

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,169
you have in mind

89
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,000
you select electric field and magnetic
fields you meet them

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,970
yeah pretty much everything in this
presentation will be

91
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,190
to that effect thr articles and

92
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,889
you are bidding

93
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,550
electric fields why would you ever do
this

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,110
who possibly who want to build homes
were

95
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,590
we're thinking that could kill you in in
your room

96
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,060
up and the short answer is because
really awesome

97
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,889
enduring criticisms we hit universe
works is often incredibly elegant

98
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,370
to a surprising degree I have found his

99
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,520
and %um particle physics and things that
you can make

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,680
using magnetic fields in charged
particles

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,590
like fields I will these pictures are
from article accelerator

102
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,849
that burns mines have constructed the
lower right

103
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,030
one is from a cyclotron that was
constructed by

104
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,960
and he is a professor at Rutgers the
meat is likely come from scratch well im

105
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,940
cyclotron

106
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,699
with it

107
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,699
you let you know magnin as well

108
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,400
to Tesla magnetic field which is an
extremely powerful and and what you see

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,969
here is actually a foster's

110
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,160
green beans slid you know you mine

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,360
and this is a long exposure photographs
plenty of solutions that the

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,270
through awesome the other is the AIM

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,370
you going into a nation's and

114
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,419
this is actually a curious you can tell
that because the purple

115
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,969
this is from you want her to fusion
apparatus that

116
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,970
carlos has using the neat thing about
this is there still real science

117
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,320
and particle physics and nuclear hearing

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,500
and electricity and magnetism I can be
done in your garage and

119
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,229
in in an era where a lot of people are
between science and we've been doing it

120
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:10,960
Commons

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,820
for a while as I didn't think that I can
walk into my garage

122
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,349
and you something that maybe no one has
done for and I can do it cheaper and

123
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,599
quicker than

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,730
most people can one of the things I
think

125
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,260
really important perfusion is that we're
going to be leaving reactors like

126
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,680
your and national emissions

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,620
the but they take for years film twenty
million dollars and only a very small

128
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,350
prison people business community
actually get you sturman

129
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,880
up with a lot of the address against us
right now

130
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,050
%uh can the Milnerton doesn't really
thousand dollars

131
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,330
a or I have known as a really as cheap
as

132
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,510
more good at fine things on me

133
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,670
and implication that is just about
anyone who is interested in these fields

134
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,460
of study

135
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,739
can build their own and do whatever they
want %uh

136
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,360
so even if you generating unsuccessful s
all the time

137
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,830
still on data could possibly use mixing

138
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,070
inclusions that's kinda big assumption
but I'm

139
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,510
we that distribute research many many
systems my knees

140
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,930
positive data yeah it's an opportunity
learns

141
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,690
yeah before whirlpool

142
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,370
duo yeah I know you

143
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,169
advocated me going back to the wrong
time

144
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,770
and doing when we return and even going
to happen

145
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,410
hello mom mobley roomie

146
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,550
on impact more yes to all of them

147
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,189
we'll we have over a year %uh we have a
community online

148
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,680
going to negotiate with we have no
meaning my

149
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,390
UK by sheer every other day we also do
anything and everything is

150
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,830
on the thing about missus whoever you're

151
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,390
once you can go and bill these things

152
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm but there are also people in this
community who have PHD's

153
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,689
and who are licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission work at national

154
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,010
and things like this

155
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,540
and when we're all willing to share
information with each other sometimes

156
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,500
work its way out channels that have
apology power to make

157
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,900
papers but its dreams that's what we're
all about II

158
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,189
again the Internet is our friend

159
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,680
this scenario and bringing this entire
community together we have a website

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,199
called

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,950
use your doc Jersey huge warm I

162
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,880
there's even a parcel experiments where
one person has done one thing is that

163
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,960
okay with that

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,720
three more seasons around the United
States are almost identical to mine

165
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,300
can be but this experiment with their
files

166
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,370
%uh so that sheer number of people there

167
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,560
doing this and know if that number ever
increases

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,888
really great will never people

169
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:08,359
using thing nothing was %um on whether
he had another the impact really

170
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,809
make away especially with how fast

171
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,920
popular medium historians you clear use
this

172
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,649
%um lockheed-martin I'm a it is very
easy to get

173
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,809
presley's and home the interwebs

174
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:28,179
you're actually doing this I undersea
difficult to control

175
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,339
right to it

176
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,750
on campus doing things like that but

177
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,269
I the Internet is the interview

178
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,430
this and for you

179
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,519
we've been talking about that later I

180
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,540
so Johnson right now lockheed-martin

181
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,050
sorry you believe it well so
lockheed-martin

182
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,430
up fusion as the

183
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,829
up on experimental level has

184
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,870
sorted out basically from the game kinda

185
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,590
smaller

186
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,000
two different from like fluorescent
label right

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,620
they have my

188
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,200
and Washington is reviewing call
infusion where they had

189
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,290
I magnin well in the center and
energized and I'm

190
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,290
phones with class together and making
use dinner that you can make a magnetic

191
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,660
field

192
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,430
down the entire the plasma have a very
much possible less intimidating

193
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,859
means everything really hot and you can
make all the fuse

194
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,350
however using on energy at into the fuse

195
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,680
and your offering anonymity %um any
energy loss

196
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,630
going a lot you

197
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,250
use so the russians theme as far as they
were at times though

198
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,220
the two minutes for a while are her into
someone's connect the two together and

199
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,620
have

200
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,700
force I'm my one with your

201
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,000
businesses and you can researchers still
to this day it was a

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,720
whose art doctors are and he's done a
lot

203
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,230
space applications %um

204
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,760
he always is the main reason russians
russians give us the whole

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,810
this technology to other me sorted

206
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,060
was because I knew no one else %um or

207
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,689
I you know year is getting close enough
that we may actually see it

208
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,950
written by you know as the saying goes
miss

209
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,890
twenty years away

210
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,230
always will be that's why status

211
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,260
always say I'm so while martin's

212
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,450
a seam issue I'm if they have perfected
nightmare

213
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,649
years so apparatus for the incident you

214
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,370
to reflect class in the back into itself
and

215
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,500
into the central even without museum

216
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,370
you know very small

217
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,170
thermal energy class sure me

218
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,439
Mike it's very on problems

219
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,449
you know

220
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,540
use your way

221
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,170
d

222
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,599
unit better publicizing

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,630
there was a month

224
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,670
my one up with my personal opinion

225
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,250
their media different

226
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,080
room

227
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,200
uncertainly talk about that well

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,020
that's that's my it's cool to see people
walking up

229
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,470
yeah time because it's usually positive
press

230
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,899
impossible years so

231
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,550
yeah I neutrons are awesome you can get
what those

232
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,109
ones with user are sawyer's and again

233
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,180
the concept known that you can t
fundamental

234
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,359
billion what's universe and smashing
together in

235
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
and get neat stuff like from

236
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,209
missus for you so

237
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,649
as far as what you can do as Ian

238
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,880
clear reactor technology in your garage
there are a couple of

239
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,839
this is at considering going down

240
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,660
uniforms were users which is why so for

241
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,709
I'm you can also make a neutron sources
al

242
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,380
as the like elemental

243
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,080
utensils so you can take in recent

244
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,550
from was pretty fun

245
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,709
reason smoke detectors yeah you know one
should it happen

246
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,739
world

247
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,550
counselors this option is not very well
what's up

248
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,008
interested parties are cautioned against
this method

249
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:34,560
a online universities though back in the

250
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,959
Atomic Energy Commission made a launcher
to me in Berlin

251
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,439
from sources remembers he's the college
user

252
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:46,579
the use or calibrated joint actors

253
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,900
there

254
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,060
school or actually hers

255
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,839
I'll I'll him

256
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,740
you know I was greater I'll

257
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,600
me

258
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
okay is thank you for the great
contracting

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,920
so Parise yeah so on

260
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,199
yes %uh they have moments is pretty
easily really cool

261
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,589
I have a friend who has me one that uses

262
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,740
I am a reason really sources I'm he's
actually a license

263
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,220
your for me officers yes we see

264
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,639
the officers and yes clearances liberty
to do some experiments

265
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,449
most resident

266
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:35,589
huge was nice %um when he is that you
can resume

267
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,919
really I'm neutron source that he's able
to play inside a high-density

268
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,669
polyethylene cylinder

269
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:44,600
that you didn't samples and do you like
you anymore or other

270
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,209
uses old you try activation

271
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,910
travel locations which is my real

272
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,618
vision science in his house and

273
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:59,290
again fusion is one I he was

274
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,889
to him upward and the in the cells

275
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:07,429
okay cool yep so quietly

276
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:10,449
like all other actually is yes I I
purity

277
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,829
Jimmy attacker and Seville activate
pieces over an incident that used to

278
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:16,019
cost you 1

279
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,059
CEO the helms pretty

280
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,139
my and usually patients are follows into
the same

281
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,629
category but on fusion is

282
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:29,769
honeymoons friendly animal abuse for
Richard

283
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,160
experimenter has what are you reading is
not going

284
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,250
reviews me

285
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,829
home moreover you lines as a result some

286
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,439
as other things you're not likely to my
there's potential there

287
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
for making things also

288
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,360
most people know

289
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,080
the radioactive voicemail

290
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,480
was hell even his name was you media
imprisoned

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,470
drums me like from most locations

292
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,940
yeah

293
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,130
and this prisoners so we now are we
talking about 20 more

294
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,860
but knowles a and look over some
marvelous lawyers are feasible

295
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,339
for me you on what I actually used in
median

296
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,909
my movie to me soon actually let's call
it wasn't wrong

297
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,370
near sawyer's so you have 88

298
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:25,469
answers online which is something yes
through and have

299
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,520
magnetic field coupled with electronic
you

300
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,750
or where you can see going through

301
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,010
inductively coupled you wanna you're
passing yes

302
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,300
through and you can mines yes which
means is now charged

303
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,480
on the other end into you you have
grounded

304
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,660
we're at a very high voltage potential
on

305
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,670
a park and when that was very viable

306
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,300
voltage potentially for instance maybe
I'll a

307
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,610
during must charge you have something on
the other hand it to you that's going to

308
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,010
be

309
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,070
namely charged and then you probably
think that the many things

310
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,740
you know potential drop between you know
I

311
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,990
for Salam or in this is

312
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,340
your there's been a rather

313
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,750
will a compile base in AM

314
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,320
very possibly arms charge so

315
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,809
you can have Park here or you wrist
agree

316
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,609
sorry difference I'm interested in using

317
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,279
day

318
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,260
inductively coupled lines like

319
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,299
and market that is also high-power

320
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,710
cock home fire these are things

321
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,750
%uh there's a there's a really need

322
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,190
you're obviously doesn't he have a lot
of space

323
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,330
you know really today and attracting
readers

324
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,530
are you for uses shoes in the garage

325
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,680
you want are interested you can look up

326
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,100
electrons so a lot of national labs that
we're doing

327
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,110
control products operators are long have
shorter accelerators are still in use

328
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,659
today

329
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,460
human interaction years call telephone

330
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,420
a woman inside us and seize their dreams
high-voltage

331
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm they have to you d

332
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,480
all organic matter al silos means

333
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,670
are about silo and the excellent with
assesses

334
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,560
which is a Inslee gas I so as to not

335
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,159
John huge sparks months

336
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,460
from miners pay I can usually get up to

337
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,410
million what's with the smartphones not
exactly

338
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,860
furniture but I'm to save space

339
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,959
there are now only if you can see in the
new year

340
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,820
or here's what happens when it happens
inside a huge long

341
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,800
basically the way they operate is that a
high energy electric source

342
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,750
him back for from all a reason you
haven't

343
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,300
system up your fuse inside it

344
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,080
home team itself articles it's between
there's some really complicated mass

345
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,659
resigned as the

346
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,040
articles coming faster choose have to
get along

347
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,440
%um mean higher this is something that
you should

348
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,260
feasibly do I am alright alan is what
matters

349
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm I haven't really had any you

350
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,290
grass yes this is not something that I'm
willing to try just yet and this is

351
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,500
something I course and

352
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,130
particle physics or experimental physics

353
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,770
for you problem

354
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,809
so well really even less cyclotron

355
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,539
possible probably the best way to an
amateur

356
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,510
Wilson very high energy in their garage
reasons

357
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,669
suicide consular is going to bother

358
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,690
back in the intervening years operators
nigga he will

359
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,450
the sole reason have to get longer and
longer frosted higher and higher

360
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,820
part James so instead what we can do

361
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,260
is a basically magnetic fields Houston

362
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,500
been I'm so if you have a circular
chamber

363
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,480
that starts out as ion source incentives

364
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,230
States time's up and streamlines you
then say

365
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,640
the magnets and those names used to
circulate

366
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,820
that I'm answers over over in so you
basically have

367
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,799
when you accelerate your just want to
make my hands around it

368
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:40,360
that makes that mean residual much as
many times as you want just depends

369
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,850
house from so believe it happens

370
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,159
this is the Sydney you only need a few
thousand

371
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,820
holes for ionizing

372
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,270
yes you have a

373
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,500
RF power supply for this most and radio

374
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,640
assessing generator as amplifiers

375
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,070
people

376
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,840
see more power that would switch Paul
area

377
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,260
water homes change you like

378
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,840
that do you think you will too incurred
leon

379
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,419
want the system's

380
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,310
or animation good receiving up to about
$1 billion

381
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,260
Michael article key which is incredibly
high

382
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,450
you're getting into you ranges that
national years

383
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,990
arms

384
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,230
Angeles Times on is in same

385
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,809
with that now offers a and his team
reacted

386
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:41,639
thanks not just really really active
thanks but managerial I'll

387
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,640
X-rays systems as a Howell I'm

388
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,460
your partners are there anything else
Prince G

389
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,730
were he's very hard here you slow down

390
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,700
print are really the issue

391
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,000
yeah %um so

392
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,980
would use hindsight constant things this
is

393
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,010
another thing an interesting quite a
while

394
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,690
and you know you're there cyclotron was
you know jim has the

395
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,750
my head feels comparable filtering a
while

396
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,010
MRI's its planes habitat garage

397
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,240
desi I'm alright central back

398
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,110
me so I'm actually looking at

399
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,330
okay how baby and how strong

400
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,350
by rare earth magnets unions

401
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,980
already feasible use bill a permanent

402
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,820
is from I found that if you have media
and grand laying around

403
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,020
actually buy really huge season diameter

404
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,179
by two-inch thick you didn't hands that
it please

405
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:48,700
you which is finally

406
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,350
humorous where the but magandang

407
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,830
bonds pushing against the borders where

408
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,158
you generate and films and somewhere
between one thousand

409
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,530
just you know how for me that

410
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,908
faces a or here and there some basic
math you

411
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,030
to determine yeah demands you this

412
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,960
signs far away

413
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,710
each other and germans renso

414
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,160
now I'm basically we didn't know I can
save money

415
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,150
recently I'm magnets Syrian

416
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,220
just treaties agreements years old

417
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,830
a.m. situations are incurred

418
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,030
you're so release reason those

419
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,559
use I'm but you're suddenly pictures

420
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,580
a thing with my yes

421
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,370
I am movies or upload cycle from

422
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,469
example long way it's actually one
recycled rather

423
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,510
made its stupid simple yeah basically a
party everywhere

424
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,910
this is something that you're right
garage with components that were a

425
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,140
bottom

426
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,820
up the national tom is actually a while
my high school's

427
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,100
ends website calls like to try kids

428
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,969
now all of whom are held a one of them
is that

429
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,580
he actually the one here want to slow

430
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,810
that the surviving as little as

431
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,850
okay anyway I V a eurozone

432
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,490
one has the and was running one has a
house on the site which one

433
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,660
kids then that means life mice

434
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,420
just incredible and it shows that have a
license

435
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,750
and as well the East Division one

436
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,550
are actually reminds for C&C that the
gas is coming in

437
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,220
back here on in there is any

438
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,050
extraction back

439
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,070
like shit so gathering here

440
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,529
answers

441
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,940
and its living room again this is a
breeze

442
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,029
back to your body and ass and your

443
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,090
transforming into a you lines then

444
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,289
certainly part mine so

445
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,158
now I'm concerned with you so you won't
have a ride as

446
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,859
what time and trying to be as brief as
possible

447
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:22,168
in this is myosins actin seen everything
I'm

448
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,300
ass you

449
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,110
that

450
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,669
news you want songs

451
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,070
so and there are things you need that we

452
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,919
my homepage patten's attackers back in
chambers

453
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,929
and the hardest thing for me with my my

454
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,230
as and Jimmy very very high vacuum

455
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,350
and rosh on very tight budget

456
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,809
so my sis my system poor

457
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,210
the user yes to backbones have a problem

458
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,230
hi mom and I have gone through several
different backgrounds

459
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,580
get where I am you simply you'll meet
Dave at indy

460
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,889
I have what's called Ireland H I have a
lot of progress

461
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,179
there your inbox

462
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,169
and Asian

463
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:15,320
a program for our communities the I'm
here

464
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,480
lineup

465
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,140
words and you

466
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,530
pressure so you are able to use Los
Feliz

467
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,680
electronics or usually by things me
they're really cheap

468
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,310
right something simple army

469
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,950
and the wrong right word ago

470
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,530
I'm so you can often get things she if
you are able

471
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,460
use reason then I have yet to see

472
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,700
no driven distance I'll 1400

473
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,120
and

474
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,149
him and I can become obsessed

475
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,340
and a in role II

476
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,610
pressure vacuum long sleeve the area

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm committee savings

482
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,719
unified you well see is a two lines that
have

483
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,110
you reason bitch as pop bomb with
usually a brushless

484
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,479
revisionism syndrome is Liza

485
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,350
resign losses this is backed by a

486
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,469
manzi certain zones eres lol

487
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,210
back pressure which allow place

488
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,580
burial for him pass

489
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,730
yes so these though are are quite

490
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,010
and the russia's movers prime I'm

491
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,320
requires controllers a while now

492
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,340
series on that was liquidated from
national laugher

493
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,928
I'm loss me and one people in the future

494
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,909
website those innocent to DIY

495
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,220
central so for 180 hours

496
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,070
have a whole along schism with control

497
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,399
I am use that for a while tree here

498
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,380
oil few months you it's this

499
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,940
that simple a a here at home

500
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,420
you know someone on the inside on and
what we had call

501
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,650
Christmas tree so anything while create

502
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,780
people goes up into this simply isn't

503
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,799
mom and has it it was a battles

504
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,040
directed she now supersonic loss

505
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,520
you can drag everything

506
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,910
chamber that into the run the

507
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,420
on 14 right lives

508
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,790
user meeting when a rapid

509
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,440
particles yours %uh

510
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,560
as I said earlier I will these yeah I'm
high energy physics

511
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,790
I was lucky enough to find a break today

512
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,260
easy high-voltage lab house

513
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,210
line he has a

514
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,150
this point by jewel transformer

515
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,220
couple problem fires girl

516
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,230
its he actually believe that home for

517
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,460
not too difficult you can get neon sign
transformers

518
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,910
up an internal injuries that

519
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,240
her them and Paul said

520
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,440
from them so basically get whom he will
like it

521
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,240
mineral long hauser live on Jan I am

with mom

523
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,420
miss it

524
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,880
France wall you know you just about as
much

525
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,150
all the best one so far as owns a
regional

526
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,549
otherwise

527
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,720
so generally

528
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,909
with certainty and you is already
resigned

529
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:02,479
I answers yes yes mines

530
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,240
or you

531
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,340
useful so sinuses have evolved

532
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,709
well the Med

533
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,240
elections that

534
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,010
use II I S things is a poll

535
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,830
it was around here is line me

536
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,230
and review

537
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,050
too much Radio Shack she print

instructions mostly inside his action

540
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,760
left

541
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,470
is usually a little bit higher voltage
power supply

542
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,850
unions

543
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,510
I am %uh with the accelerators and beams

544
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,850
are already mentioned you

545
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,879
moms fires or amplifiers &

546
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,130
line UK yeah I'm really not that hard

547
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,360
instruct their on struggles guys world

548
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,939
organs or

549
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,420
particle accelerators your network

550
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,630
actually walls yes

551
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,460
job-killer it's not news

552
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,810
so also

553
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,149
me I didn't mention that is extrusions

554
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,000
utilize mine dentist or firecrackers

555
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,530
who are right now

556
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,190
expirations homers and there are a lot
of fun %um

557
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,250
caution is bird

558
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,730
them me these are synergen well

559
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,340
and

560
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,340
and thus huge deal you

561
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,689
altogether 500

562
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,940
system there and hers help you

563
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,760
truck drug dealers you're very
interested in experiencing

564
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,180
there's one scene and scrap yard
measuring

565
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,650
location their rooms over 100 losses

566
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,790
him for him by

567
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:06,950
yep home

568
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,519
his Yahoo by

569
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,639
actually a transformer and remove it
yeah

570
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:20,370
detection equipment is very important
because you're going to be generating

571
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,678
preview new clients or star

572
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,610
our own potential you

573
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,559
razor one the usual or

574
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,399
neutrons gonna have some but tell you

575
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,990
happen especially when you get away hope
for

576
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,000
things like that we have all seen

577
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,770
for

578
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,990
this Beijing show

579
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,000
your sectors or we actually

580
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,990
she so this is very important

581
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm 301 is billions

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,580
-2 you not budget

583
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,649
on

584
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:02,729
not prepping this is very important

585
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,110
itself that

586
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,010
ballroom C me

Disney

588
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,730
this cell as you know your part

589
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,990
you yeah

590
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,759
market

591
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,910
yes

592
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,168
so random

593
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:21,210
its

594
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,080
yessum these thats there

595
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,500
people have around so adhering

596
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,119
much when all you

597
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,669
covers around

598
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,418
violence people here pretty home

599
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:40,750
day you can buy all us skyre

600
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,230
or 30 about them

601
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,969
yes

602
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,770
me they're also other million

603
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,849
prices meanwhile one all

604
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,690
well physically attacked their unit and
buttons and

605
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,780
second I have

606
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,420
for your brother

607
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,940
it's ok minute at all

608
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,069
thousand has all free and fires

609
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,060
here

610
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,710
her old boss yen you're playing a team
in this

611
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,230
wild comparable

612
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,120
fired him or something wrong

613
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,980
there also why call

614
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,300
the attacker legos call means

615
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,450
iraq slalom

616
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,450
and

617
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,169
happen for room

618
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,490
for

619
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,649
us

620
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,850
and often

621
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,060
places like black hole you ever find
yourself and was almost there is

622
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,200
or Oracle's allow all black hole

623
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,220
and they have also nuclear electronics

624
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,580
back in chambers and yours for by
frightening

625
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,020
while on so huge pile

626
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,109
name

627
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,690
this so as far as the Apple to use

628
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,250
you counter and fire that

629
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,240
you want baggage

630
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,319
me

631
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,220
fun here are also is by and large

632
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,629
up play are you know base geyer

633
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,390
him by

634
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,230
her

635
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,470
you which is really I serve you

636
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,709
what they see things like things race

637
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,710
yes where I'll

638
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,290
proportional to serbian things like
hands

639
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,500
particles inference I have both a

640
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,940
he did you manage yet review which
basically moderator

641
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,710
yes carelessly them new from you

642
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,440
room on remand human like people's
attack

643
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,790
this is really well

644
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,540
yeah meanwhile

645
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,500
you review

646
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,010
this is an impairment happening

647
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,340
the lead actor policy actors their also
very way

648
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,640
simply whose yet

649
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,410
so who's actually me there are many
people who have the same

650
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,230
little like yourselves or small home
