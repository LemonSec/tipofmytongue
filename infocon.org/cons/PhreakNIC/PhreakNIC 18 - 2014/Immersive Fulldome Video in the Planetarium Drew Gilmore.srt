Yahoo these

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,930
a Walter projectors this is the SOES Rs

122
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,070
and the 10,000 the way

123
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,419
for twenty now

124
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,479
not move them and 24

125
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,530
already image from forming here's

126
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,349
to me okay but k image his actors

127
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:56,750
so a computers right video with lantern
Asia is that it hasn't decided lands on

128
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,000
it

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,250
wish I'll last occurring higher

130
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,419
the home with %uh any no

131
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,900
collar ivory planetarium the actual
using

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,060
Starsky & dissolved same time

133
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,240
and so delivers their

134
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,460
here see lines connected

135
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,530
constellations and those lines with this
is a big problem

136
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,880
the front and back to room where star
furnishings

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,350
seller and so the gym these two

138
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,640
loser systems are talking to each other
and so certain who this term sheet

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,140
around

140
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,939
the damage is a gradual fall right

141
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,260
so we're the only largest planetary

142
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,140
United States doesn't have the knowledge
these systems are working together

143
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,770
this & Poor's a

144
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,790
you know in the old-style planter you
know you know maybe by six seven

145
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,310
different

146
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,920
silencers which show once line and is

147
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,599
raised in a certain location to for a
consolation to you that one are the sky

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,110
and had just started exactly the right
spot the passage

149
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,240
were well now and then we're going to
you all

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,010
any consolation figures state years up

151
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,850
while the years in India Chinese her
Egyptian

152
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,400
where to accomplish in this offer so it
really

153
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,899
loans as a tool %ah a straight line

154
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,000
now %uh horse additional system can also
show you love this little stars

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,089
and so there's a lot of plants and other
only do

156
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,560
diesels isn't there another big storm me
in the room and that's fine for lunch

157
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,630
but the

158
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,839
little stars are still couldn't be heard
a humorous is a problem

159
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,200
no up

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,100
your rest are as legal system burgundy
Hyundai

161
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,290
them and so really really want

162
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,160
leave very realistic nice guy and only
enough mister

163

every time you know things will see the
the

279
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,639
production time and a door space does
have a financially

280
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,130
so the question is is the overall

358
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,790
while

359
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,370

for star but small though sure you gotta

510
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,200
data plan for him others a smaller

511
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,600
I'll a number projectors and you've got

512

by Simone Julia do with them

516
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,540
furs for you for planetarium

517
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,620
existed world how the question when the
older pictures

518
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,629
yeah for yeah i spose I think Tom

519
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,060
I was saying I don't care about the time
exactly I think the

520
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,840
a probably in Germany and ran with it
with the timing was probably

521
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,830
on out

522
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,300
I'm so I don't like it was something he
may be in the twenties or early

523
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,570
for that I'll I know that in chicago the
casting call the Atwoods

524
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,129
here which is just a big metal all
interested in and then roll the ball

525
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,040
around you and Paul has little

526
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,460
pin holes in it and so today it does
seem like the right in saying starts

527
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,700
that way

528
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,530
i think is a big problem with Carl Zeiss
coming to be the first

529
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,850
searched are all projector up tomorrow
one

530
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,169
I'll

531
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,970
I wanna see that might be in the
twenties something and that is what you

532
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,610
define as

533
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,750
planetarium also you know does that
Edwards

534

they would withhold to lyndon

535
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,610

against other than maybe he is just a

536
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,620
stealing the stars up he did on camp
home nine innings
