left hand tell you there is a scale

272
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,300
I solo Road a project is enough room to
another store

273
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,329
as a although where you to go

274
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,709
earlier in fast food in your room all

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,900
overall hell you know

279
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,240
last four years what a 25

280
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,290
up thirty years well players

281
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,960
we think my view was in the bathroom
home no

282
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,030
and yeah the early so on the corners
ice-t_

283
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,710
by the time you get to be a PhD
researcher

284
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,820
class to you impose

285
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,960
lead and here's the rover mission

286
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,060
you're going to be career probably have
to live

287
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,928
already you

288
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,019
was your research institution you're
probably going to be

289
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,490
in your face if you go to last

290
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,409
billed as a certified in seniors bill
uses

291
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:25,100
Sunday back they would you like to see
the day

292
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,149
as years not good they don't want to be
here

293
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,869
midday so the challenges that lay out
for us

294
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:36,399
of him is do this that you can get here

295
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,658
years so glide

296
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,720
or way go ahead

297
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,730
blood later hit

298
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,760
pattern really or

299
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,840
up where's your homework him so %um
however

300
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,780
call radioisotope heryana generator RTG

301
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,470
basically is a little all in time
plutonium is

302
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm ready where not so you won't miss
you

303
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,360
um it as it is a Israel as

304
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,590
is re-elected arms and that is precisely
the

305
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,799
okay so he's very warm and there's also

306
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,400
II was he generate electricity

307
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
so we know how long it takes you know

308
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,280
Sonim is always good K at

309
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,600
and based on that work for less
continues

310
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,110
and it won't you all another radiating

311
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,449
generate electricity how with brand new

312
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,070
is a okay but where you both ways

313
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,710
still calling home bedroom okay

314
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,630
and we are using the space that will be
a status to find

315
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,610
and was there want here

316
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,969
his where it is variable

317
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,230
is day to rate you will use race today
Rob

318
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,900
cameras losses in front of him you see

319
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,140
up but the horrible feels very

320
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,200
missus Henry is having I and sis

321
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,850
newsletters things like that is that it
is easier than that

322
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,209
has no access the perfect so that means

323
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,870
is something like higher today you yes

324
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,570
is back my right but is not please join
hamas

325
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,720
Anders line through you know million
miles a day

326
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,540
camp a few minor so they're doing
science but not as precise

327
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,470
were juniors als so how do this

328
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,429
we're propulsion technologies you
measure

329
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,330
citizens baseball I manage yes in
baseball

330
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,540
I'll Russian world but I'll tell you
about what he saw

331
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,190
electric all is pretty cool

332
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,669
instead of playing over her office and
national your

333
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,710
upstate new roles alright for bowling
balls

334
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,730
work was on hand

335
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,810
I me away as a rock

336
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,030
I hear his way rutgers is

337
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,129
notarized yeah

338
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,720
president did I am so

339
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,380
the he is your exhaust moves fast as you
can

340
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,770
so that momentum is conserved

341
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,370
Williams service listen to right is

342
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,310
conservation movement he had you do
something your reaction to react

343
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,690
throughout

344
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,360
led away you go this way drove faster
you go there

345
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,909
alright selector all musical

346
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,580
but uses electric fields and I'm

347
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,199
profiles or electrons and if you strip
from

348
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,540
some yeah there is some Ross

349
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,690
who yeah celebrated I guess I'm
exhilarating across the left-field

350
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,200
room in the back rocking to make new
leaving I'll ever

351
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,570
all as israel's Russell never is all
plan once you get into space

352
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,669
you can get a ten times the total book

353
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,500
program fuel with an 11 holes

354
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,660
that you can get along so %um

355
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,390
in rocket giving lessons were really
hungry right sizes

356
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,670
grizzard runs right %um yeah

357
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,160
everywhere you go so I'm also not for me

358
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,590
life there a hammer something don't know

359
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,919
well it is their homes visit the inlaws

360
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,970
is a measure efficiency up the user says

361
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,160
alright so capable rise as the impulse

362
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,950
about 400 to 600 say s 11 homes

363
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,480
Rs and balance says so you get a lot
more

364
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,540
change in velocity repellent fuel is
little slow slow

365
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,110
rusted shut down you got twenty years
right so it's a very efficient way to do

366
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,620
it

367
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,169
we look at the design and you do this
solar electric or

368
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,340
newsletters use community forums
plutonium dust

369
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,300
gotta degenerated how are you doing
right sweetie I have taken a nuclear

370
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,490
power plants around here

371
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,720
Minister awesome know that's all

372
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,970
russians have for TVs you know your this

373
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,570
you nervous than players your 30-day

374
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,919
nuclear reactors for review okay

375
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,110
and you're left of this afternoon about
little radiating

376
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,290
crash and a I okay you don't think about
that year-over-year

377
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,879
their highly radioactive uranium visit
after blowing

378
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,110
their day you can use as they say

379
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,490
going out into space our leadership the
problem is expensive

380
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,730
you of this

381
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,630
we always are billion dollars to take
nuclear power plant miniaturized

382
00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:00,049
Billy levels grad that it was a Soviet
rocket launchers and let it go

383
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,389
the North right lead in the polls in
israel's

384
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,140
flying if you look at it all in Mission
Diego Union

385
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,130
I he couldn't happen is a like Paul his
visit to mingle hathaway's

386
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,840
series investors racism solar level

387
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
who villages more fruitful

388
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,510
going to the source or usual roses help
you

389
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,820
the and wish to see the hands

390
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,760
or not so long as Israel used in
different ways

391
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,940
from the reactor okay really really hard
to do

392
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,299
arm chemical rockets can't do it

393
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,460
and the only other thing that might be a
who is a technology company passionate

394
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,870
about home solo se

395
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,620
obviously house for sale you can't feel
it

396
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,840
all white with less use pushing

397
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,010
like has numerous yes but it does at the
moment

398
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,090
really human right it was born in France

399
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,360
right but is also does not arrive so
what happens is Sun

400
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,659
always shines space okay

401
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,290
always have a your shadow here that his
virtual

402
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,840
jurors will be the same as always L and
is that why

403
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,850
reflects large lightweight material say

404
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,990
it will too small

405
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,669
is about PLC force pro-football

406
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:32,850
you later very small Wisconsin always

407
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,480
push okay so few good for all

408
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,990
football size the same size warlord

409
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,730
this film is here into space

410
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,770
eighty propel your space rare Free Press

411
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,320
now you have another thing working for
useful the universe

412
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,409
we're all not much man okay

413
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,200
basically what it says is you if this is
the Sun

414
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,390
and this is the horror there's a certain
amount like Paul

415
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,900
unless a fun moving away from the site
and I double the distance

416
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,330
it's not happening like it drops even
worse

417
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,049
there's only one

418
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:12,408
for the line says 14 the book

419
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:16,519
not very much fun that he had the
distance and

420
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,600
and you know its place Bush

421

is about 200 meters on Sunday esprit de

425
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,869
deploy it close to the Sun and get the
celebration

426
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:45,080
need take wrote about half the size and
weight

427
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,279
got a lot better electronics today than
we deserve these lot better materials

428
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,879
criticized any go fast to get 250 SL

429
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:59,248
for use with 20 use I'll so we can use

430
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,259
okay have influence they let a

431
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,460
no we had who work you know

nasa the europeans

433
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:13,008
and the Japanese have developed a solar
sails

434
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:17,179
and he's already flying realism we were
gonna

435

yeah it was lost on me why they did that

451
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,660
but it works beautifully this sales
fourteen years on the side has been

452
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,740
flying in space

453
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,370
reuse okay hundred-person sister

454
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,090
they demonstrated that they were that in
every day sales

455
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,090

this

465
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,430
well you tell you is is the laws of
physics will allow us

466
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,820
to do this no three engineers and have
crazy

467

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,790
very large solo sail well as I they were

473
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,520
thank you 60 is already really close

474
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,800
can get really really largest orations

475
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
and go to the source made a century or
less

476
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,720
if you want to speed up they develop
good evening ladies

477
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,920
in space so that has been the most

478
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,710
where law doesn't kill you as you have
the solar system

479
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,180
you can continue pushing on Tuesday as
it leaves

480
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,850
the idea here is to the very Moore's
latest the something that has the energy

481
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,560
up with

482
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,450

484
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,180
don't think small and you can use that
laser beam

485
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,400
to stay focused on that sale and Senate
on ways that you get there in a few days

486
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,350
to another store for you bro now

487
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,510
do we have the flu have all the systems
built a new steps to meet a

488
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,580
as abilities for solar sail learning how
to fly those days

489
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,850
I work on a %uh tolls Indian

490
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:48,719
nasa okay we don't military stuff but
interest on our school which is in

491
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,610
Huntsville

492
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,659
they're working on I'm client relations
to defend troops

493
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,190
more defense horrible lazim

494
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,780
its not quite this but other than that

495
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,040
rock 100 to 200 kilowatts

496
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,300
okay these brains

497
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,750
are gonna let us take the first steps
toward doing being energy potions

498
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,930
place an early days

499
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:18,260
the new systems here to go to the store
lasers a little bit

500
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,800
there are other ways you doing I was the
review for National Geographic

501
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,590
television series

502
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,510
last year two years ago and was calling
back in waco

503
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,660
why was 10 that way of looking awfully
busy area

504
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,640
roast are coming your way gonna

505
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,590
were all and as always we're all gonna
die seventy-five years from male

506
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,459
go for you alright a

507
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,970
so they asked least options we can go to
store

508
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,980
i haaaate handsome if we've only got
thirty five years

509
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,510
the earth is gonna be destroyed anyway
you build project a row

510
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,740
you never project Orion man you got news
for you

511
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,280
okay back in the late fifties for about
97

512
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,210
Freeman Dyson way to propose to me in
September just got a picture

513
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,170
you're with me young family

514
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,370
wanted

515
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,070
came up with this idea that you can take
to ship this item has shipped make an

516
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,770
airtight

517
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,900
would be a shock absorbers and red

518
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,880
and start blowing up hinds balls bloom

519
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,020
boom bottom get off the planet

520
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,710
into space well it turns out they were
crazy

521
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,830
I don't know if this video play they'd
is untested

522
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:48,580
up thank you review

523
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,899
returns

524
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,610
so what was calculated was show

525
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,379
the battleship size too big dropping the
small

526
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,620
tactical news out the back he hit

527
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,939
3 percent whites the and alpha centauri

528
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,179
140 use I would contend if we have 75
years

529
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,440
to the earth was gonna be destroyed and
you didn't worry about trashing

530
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,179
the virus you in the process as you do
is to save lives

531
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,080
this is the way to go we could do this

532
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,399
now people asking you still need as many
buildings space

533
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:30,428
no students master totally a friend

534
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:33,940
yes a hundred and forty years from his
perspective

535
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,740
less true and 3d satellites be

536
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,190
doesn't do too much time wish you don't
have a whole lot

537
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,049
relativistic effects is there is real
that is not a huge deal

538
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:48,440
3 percent yet to get off early lows you
like to know this

539
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,600
special relativistic effects now we can
you can measure to ensure

540
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,668
but it would be like twins are you going
to come back in

541
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,310
you know your twin

542
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,230
fifty years so good question but it's
not a big news

543
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,380
yeah arm are you is OK

544
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,530
are you sorry where around

545
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,480
way on my this with this will be a
voyage

546
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,679
these numbers will just get his bestie
because you know the office and Tori

547
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,220
final destination you wanna make sure
when you planning to bring something

548
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:20,790
absolutely

549
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,080
right I mean that would be a bad you
know it's a nice looking just turn

550
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,790
around this place is what

551
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,560
yeah it was the reforms document I

552
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,000
when I don't know why I said like
contractors I have in mind Asia

553
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,050
hey so know that a problem you got you
got a plan to me you would have slowed

554
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,679
him

555
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,750
but this can be done and and my message
two days

556
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,620
this is not your lights or salesman's
able to do this pretty trashed

557
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,638
plant but we do this the Holy Grail

558
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,590
K love traditional rockets is a fusion
for bill

559
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,900
starship since I made his short life
Martin announced that they have a

560
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,930
prototype a

561
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,740
fusion reactor your about their have
heard about that

562
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,879
read about it I don't have a really is
but that's pretty friendly company

563
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,630
and pretty credible people repulsion
coming out saying that they think they

564
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,160
can have a compact power reactor in 20
years

565
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,680
was a breakthrough today okay right now
it's real

566
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,910
the solar system's out us because once
we start circling fusion starships

567
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,129
the solar systems and people in
alternate space

568
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,490
in our neighborhood hampton-el 30
astronomical unit

569
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,220
region becomes by and if Israel

570
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,600
his way we might view

571
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,390
to use to go to the stores Fusion driven
starship uses the same

572
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,170
energy process that our son uses to
produce all the same

573
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,120
to produce the power to drive the rock
okay

574
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,020
and essentially there are lots of ways
to do that

575
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,320
prior to the lock in is in a few weeks
ago all the fusion research is being

576
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,880
done

577
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,150
in facilities the sizes hotel
essentially

578
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,850
to get a fusion reaction to go and they
had nearly reached

579
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,279
and maintain what's called rate you we
get as much leverage

580
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,890
out is used to start the fusion reaction
going in

581
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,020
and to be a viable I was so he don't
wanna lose power going with the morale

582
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,040
and but if there were Israel in this is
on its way to be

583
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,560
here there are groups that have already
done concept designs and you start ships

584
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,580
British and Planetary Society done that

585
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,970
back in the seventies season scaled here

586
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,189
75 if you come to Huntsville you can see
what it is

587
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,780
ignorance eucharist is looking at that
today

588
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,790
the prisoners don't know that was that's
right probably within

589
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,820
I'm very jealous neighbors okay

590
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,090
at other japanese were success

591
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,740
werner said so here we are yeah protests

592
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,109
this is this is you know you have %um I
can see the lease

593
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,410
something we'll these I'll right

594
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:08,330
so this is something that might be out
there in the future now

595
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:14,610
anti-matter is even better anti-matter
is not the stuff of science fiction

596
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,290
in science fiction but is very real it
was detected as far back as the nineteen

597
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,670
or use okay anti-matter

598
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,430
is nothing is weird as it sounds alright

599
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,120
it is day a a and electron

600
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,960
that looks just like an electron is the
same as in literally but is that a

601
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,080
negative charge

602
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,140
it's got a positive charges home
possible or

603
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,430
and as another property cialis is

604
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,899
been state is a little different to but
the the meeting about in areas that when

605
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,060
it comes in contact with his regular
matter

606
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,950
camera or they annihilate developers to
the energy gamma rays

607
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,370
all kinds and other nasty stuff but is
the most efficient

608
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,750
energy conversion no text all the mass

609
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,780
imposed unity equals MC squared

610
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,089
nothing more fish

611
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:07,269
the net so you can track anti-male

612
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:12,808
and story you can use a control release
event I'm am

613
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,019
with just about anything to use as few

614
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,479
and use that to dry historic okay

615
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,069
so this is what

616
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:27,130
concept to anti marriage in with lying
I'm

617
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,809
tell you right now that that there were
some experiments done in Huntsville

618
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,740
in the late 90s to try will build the
world's first

619
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,959
demonstration a bit anti-matter thrust
the idea was to take

620
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,329
a magnet travel any tram

621
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,760
which is basically a strong man that a
few quick physics tutorials either

622
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,700
rocket scientist

623
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,169
you his at all okay charged particles

624
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,839
we were travelling in a genre magnetic
fields like the bar at

625
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,089
they'd be a they move in today tell your
own

626
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,160
agree to TV as usual okay

627
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,009
so the bill is strong enough in a minute
fuel you can

628
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:12,700
trap charged particles on fuel line

629
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,848
and Walt accident a few upwards in

630
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:21,039
so he put all the air out have a strong
magnetic fields were

631
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,930
anti-matter here already ma'am you
contracted

632
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,629
and there's nothing for it to hit 29 so
you can store it

633
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,220
pay so the idea was to take a trial

634
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,580
with her

635
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,009
power source and I netball want to

636
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,910
for me lab the particle accelerator your
Chicago

637
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,560
where they were routinely produced small
a man who had a have taken be more

638
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,730
willing to the city and Mary produce

639
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,920
into this magnetic ball and try to get
back to Huntsville

640
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,210
yes try to back to Huntsville

641
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,880
and the meeting is not aware that this
then calculated the amount of radiation

642
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,490
in the universe

643
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,049
little teeny tiny mini van der will be
the same suggest picture

644
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,310
so it's not like it's gonna be the bomb
okay

645
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,450
whether it is bringing back in a
laboratory in the world

646
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,740
measure Russ from a small anti members
rushed

647
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,379
yes it would be male sports but it would
be

648
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,270
the first time somebody's arenas so they
get all the plans together

649
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,509
and somebody says we know isn't a rule
that you're in radioactive material

650
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,930
across state lines that we all truly do
you know

651
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,190
missing the only do so if they win
tonight was used a Commerce Commission

652
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,460
or a member is regulated trucking me
said you know we want to transport

653
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,590
anti-matter

654
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,980
was there right now I'm we know this is
the typical government bureaucrats story

655
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,720
okay

656
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,259
who went with us the bureaucrats meant
to say

657
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,920
now that's interesting got a book laid
it down he said we have space for that

658
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,540
a

659
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,808
drew scored

660
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:05,180
only thing I have the we is that during
the nineteen fifties

661
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,930
people were thinking about a billion
times that's the only thing I can think

662
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:14,368
I have no idea lastly we already have
specifications for transporting in time

663
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:19,160
%uh unfortunately this project is
canceling that has never before

664
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,799
how much anti matter to me

665
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,720
well think billion folks when he turns
out

666
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,339
I don't want to build a plant that makes
the enzyme an extensive anti-matter

667
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:37,558
birds if you have a tournament I'm am an
accident

668
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,010
think the killing the dinosaurs okay

669
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,950
so you want to do this all planned you
have facility in space

670
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,189
so there's an industrial accident you
don't like that me

671
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,069
alright so its do all we know how to
make anti-matter

672
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:55,099
you know how story we don't know how to
do know the scale

673
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:59,299
instead it turns the annual production
didn't story

674
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:02,940
is on the order mannerisms so a long way
to go

675
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,440
yes up as far away as you can

676
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,990
a yeah

677
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,790
yeah realistically you know somewhere

678
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,350
so we're beyond them not that far but
you know long way

679
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,680
yeah I was about leeson's one was a
comment over here I'm sorry

680
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,509
their believe we might actually in the
no

681
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,970
no it make sure you know I tell you the
big with this stuff

682
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,549
that still small tables compared with
you the worst yeah

683
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,690
group any that's it

684
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,340
does another story your good thank you
all right there

685
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm so so we're gonna leave you with
this

686
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,730
is you know we live in a society today

687
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,380
I think we have diminished expectations
wheels and be

688
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,290
you know we seem to be really I'm
serious union sees me know

689
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,279
you know one time we without being we
thought about going to a movie we did it

690
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,920
in years

691
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,130
with I i mean we gonna be does not see
so they don't killers

692
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,810
war we have to invent something on
nuclear power needed to know whether

693
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:18,359
used we did alright we have ended about
a navy the protest ever you know free

694
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,160
commerce around the world we do it

695
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,690
the highways your imagination help we we
we want my dad was

696
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,509
was a way I mean no driving across
country was like driving

697
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:33,679
two-lane road that happens rather you
know and it is wonderful interstate

698
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,679
highway system which is an incredible

699
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,959
incredible achievement we don't think
the day

700
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:44,919
on trying to challenge people to think
Bay I i get a text of this was called

701
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:50,038
the Bay can do this today your kids
probably won't do this

702
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,589
but unless we start taking steps now
laying the groundwork people think it's

703
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,759
possible we'll never do

704
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:58,269
so I'm just gonna try to motivate let
you know that there are still people

705
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,288
thinking

706
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:02,729
yet but soon wanna things soldiers

707
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:05,739
say no thing mahler

708
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:10,499
morning that for rent or other

709
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:14,529
you can use my larach because neither
Polian with Kelsey p1

710
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:17,889
which is a balloon in Co 2 plastic
essentially

711
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:21,209
and I have a piece of it Andrea at all
to more

712
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:24,759
so you can minute talk about solar sails
and I'll

713
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:29,029
pieces or senator like treasury of life
I canyon rim

714
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:34,309
for you so know you will owe it so I am

715
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:38,439
Sony let me %uh let me just get gil is
not taking your questions

716
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:42,399
the other message I want to tell you is
that the laws of nature and not holes we

717
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:43,368
can go to the store

718
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:47,630
laws in nature is that if you wanna go
to story go

719
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,709
is going to be more and so the question
I have

720
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:52,810
users from you think

721
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,970
about for you to think about is are we
up to you know are we as a species

722
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,490
good essentially remain trapped in
forever on Monday we can take that wage

723
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm hoping its own lives and zulu and
I'll tell you as a personal site

724
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,350
we have one of those internal management
training class

725
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,930
and were and they asked people you know
what motivates you

726
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,259
how do you want to be remembered and you
think is the common

727
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,910
at a place like nasa remember us being
is a private citizen recounting a

728
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,930
personal experience not speaking for the
aids

729
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,250
and in my way I want to be remembered

730
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,000
is when the first column around another
storage room

731
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,840
writing the history of their is
something I worked on is a plutonium

732
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,340
unit history that's what I want him

733
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,140
and follow people there in that class I
was the only one that he's a spatially

734
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,509
and what they say they want

735
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:50,829
for and you know I love my kids and all
that I want my kids to look at this is

736
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,029
that we're involved

737
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,690
you did that you know my
great-great-great so

738
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,089
anyway that motivates yessir you

739
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,609
yeah quick comment

740
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:05,670
sure when I was in college the

741
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,880
been the last century home we had
something to your agency nasa

742
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,190
whom not warranted and they were

743
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,329
promoting the said the budget basically
is an opponent and was

744
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,839
or alien reasons

745
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,890
and I i want to be with us will

746
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,640
mid-seventies and I'm isolation room

747
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,890
I say gentleman I'll you know we grew up
with

748
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,259
Licensed Made Easy Star Wars and Star
Trek analyzes them

749
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:41,579
we don't wanna radio and we want my mind

750
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,269
scram and so or my college friends you

751
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,569
nightline's so my question to you is

752
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:52,140
users know so we're going to have his
sale

753
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,839
sizes next no how far away from all the
space junk do we have to get to the sale

754
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,849
doesn't worry

755
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,849
well that's the question why and you're
a symbol is this

756
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,940
big sale lawyers in washington's days

757
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,089
in space jams really restricted over who
if you get out on the former is mostly

758
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:12,328
just into space is a

759
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:12,730
you

760
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,760
me Mike years and we don't I

761
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,210
glossy impact s to come fun %uh

762
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,510
other material and is so thin

763
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,240
this stuff so fast it goes through
without causing much energy

764
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,359
and is this little lamb pinprick and
sales actually interests of them so cute

765
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,910
here is not gonna go very for

766
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,290
know who to block a balloon hit with
that same might be right you will be

767
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,050
slow

768
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:43,510
because they can %uh the energy is all
the positive and all that he's gotta go

769
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,090
somewhere frenetic energy

770
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,430
and it caused it to explode sales are so
thin

771
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,569
that it really use visual and that's it

772
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,910
so it really is very slow but and
admiration

773
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,620
doesn't it doesn't your me sale here you
know

774
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,140
because the rest stop %uh every half and
half the you

775
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,020
there's a chemport or going through
which is restored

776
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,490
so if you do get it here or the whole is
not propagating

777
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,859
get me no questions

778
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,310
yes I'm my question

779
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,470
US Army different places having

780
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,950
project how much migration their me

781
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,060
homes

782
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,930
up there are there are regular
conferences worries your results

783
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,839
and and I've been very undercover
investigator on the europeans or sale

784
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,330
and so I see all our design data on the
horror that salutes very collegial

785
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:49,450
although there are some working on that
the rig

786
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,669
and Japanese virgin head they basically
told us everything that sale

787
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,420
after the fluid because they want to be
the first to fly in planetary

788
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,480
sourcing not only its way cool that
everything

789
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,560
