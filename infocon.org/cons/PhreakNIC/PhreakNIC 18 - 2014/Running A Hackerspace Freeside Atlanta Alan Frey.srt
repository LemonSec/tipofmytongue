space purely operations challenges in
the future

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,090
which is a vision quest I'm place

23

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,119

your Realtor I'll as word

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,900
remembrances his space

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,900
for community gathers seem personal

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,940
you Lisa I'll

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,260
was I'm was

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,579
this is a great question I'll basically

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,900
you should first ask why

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,660
because why is hear you the first

48
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,650
important things and

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,489
place community the jury knowledge and
physical space

50
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,349
sure possession yes you went through the
wall tangible way

51
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,760
yes and you like to explore ensure a
long time

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,899
Ellen ball this is all only

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,640
this is very reasons actors lines

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,899
more importantly or reasons why not

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,480
well this is this is up this is why I

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,768
I liked our shores everything

57
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,319
although I don't like the word close I
don't like well

58
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,349
field but generally everything else

59
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,078
morals this is kinda

60
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,760
for I'll a lot of people get into

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,638
Motwani I'll have her space but then
realized they don't need a single spaced

62
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,109
this whole you know why you there's need
a

63
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,560
up later

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,800
widely used you know well you

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I think this I you want to make money

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,040
that's actually another good one I'll
insult failure

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,190
I'll usually does long

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,959
people subsidize your house use personal
applications

69
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,690
and almost we're leaving those up these
are all terrible reasons to get

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,820
this I'll this is a very

71
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,469
reveals traditionally held I'll

72
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,320
many with I'll

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,560
so this is more or less I'll sign

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,200
sorry but this is actually a pretty
common template terrell

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,640
all hours is a first I'll

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,860
you building in first so

77
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,380
this is before you even gonna look in
the spaces foreign minister business

78
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,840
fleetingly thinking about you I'll

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,469
just go ahead and build a comedian and

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,640
good is unit once a week up because

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,370
that once a week he is going to
translate directly into your once a week

82
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,130
open house

83
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,969
you're going to hell I space which is
going to bring in more people

84
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,320
more

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,389
so I think bars

86
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,430
good a lot of people do tabletop gaming

87
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,729
a bars a excellent places

88
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:19,870
and for got seated well okay

89
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,190
when you forget everything in this
presentation for the birds well

90
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,039
I'll is that are other good

91
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,759
place be I'll basically a worthy you can
see yourself

92
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,940
pointing it out games you should use
your because

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,270
meeting is a little play annual own room
and this could help

94
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,109
Lord whitetails and winds stills

95
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,660
upside bus I'll

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,030
this so you're sorry is you actually
even play

97
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,729
so even though is a non-profit I'll you
need to

98
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:56,320
like come up with an idea how simple
diagrams

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,969
all I recommend a row

100
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,090
immediately on 501 c3 I'll

101
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,460
a lot I'll places I decided not to go
lol

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,489
readers LLC or do some other kind of
I'll

103
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,130
you things animals hail a and the

104
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,750
star space this way in the alternative

105
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,750
probably no just commit and do it begins
again

106
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,520
people who are you going out what's
incident I'll

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,770
three to six months operating

108
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,419
cause I mean this is pretty much like
you go to SB 800

109
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,300
and you know that governments to tell
you how to start a business

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,890
bill clinton's and Springs you know

111
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,630
and a this one is very up

112
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,120
this is worse way marital arguments

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,130
where the space located this is all

114
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,520
and this will bring up worst

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,890
people so

116
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,250
this is you know these are completely
and totally made up

117
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,740
but they're made of based facts and

118
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,870
this is like stuff but I surveyed on on
many different actors spaces

119
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,320
not only in the southeast also just US

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,570
I don't know that supplies European
first least in here

121
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,060
I'll 22-25 members is lying

122
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,260
there possible I'll talk to collect
honors in a pretty much say

123
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,360
yeah I was about two dozen every time
and

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,420
that's for a small space for a much
larger space

125
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,520
the number tends to RO day

126
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,070
and this is the enemy for this numbers

127
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,230
and I think there's good reason for that

128
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,870
a yeltsin's you are were calling
automatic

129
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,060
numbers group so there seven 30

130
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,470
and a hundred underneath it being done
on this number which is the

131
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,750
arts number trial everybody knows
everybody else

132
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,180
and 30b number of people that

133
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,300
are most familiar with one another 17
people in line

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,950
communicate on a regular basis so

135
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,979
that ends up completely translated

136
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,900
here I as you can see you have a core
group of seven people

137
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,929
and those people in turn communicate 27
people

138
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,790
that topsoil 49 so that signs

139
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,310
so that makes sense it squares with a
with the knowledge but again a simple

140
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,429
yet

141
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,478
lesser and of also expect

142
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,340
30 2/3 innings me dropouts locations

143
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,240
you remember that formal image all you
located

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,070
my house

145
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,230
on it so I'm that's what happens

146
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,810
and pretty much you need plant

147
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,020
so if you're going to open a large space
about 10 days

148
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,510
and you have a fifty members asocial

149
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,300
cannot be left with twenty miles bridge

150
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,170
thats and that way when I will rip I'll

151
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,180
yeah

152
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,140
so this isn't so much about doing this
master

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,649
really like what kinda stuff small I'll

154
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,709
and these go over any number of reasons
but

155
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,010
Mosley vs I'll like the rules

156
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,080
I'll lot to a really gamers

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,560
station with people and life go good
leaders

158
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,020
putting their be down on the albright

159
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,050
problems so with the biggest reasons the

160
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,399
you'll get a really cool tool like a 3d
printer annual World

161
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,570
I'll as 3d printers what so

162
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,300
no one will know printer so now you have
a critical

163
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,899
so your ISP's structure as possible pro
and

164
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,410
same goes it any other large expense to
or you'll say well I don't like

165
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,730
Orleans so that's ish getting the basic
tools

166
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,200
we used in June recycled

167
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,149
almost uni project because you mean like

168
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:17,769
1

169
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,929
it well 16 lives like

170
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,988
fifteens speaking actually collecting

171
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:27,199
I'll so that I don't like Maryport

172
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,689
kinda overlooks is a myspace cleanliness

173
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,730
really important I'll the reason

174
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,049
it's important to keep it clean it's not
because that gives the witches and the

175
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,040
cleaner way

176
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,839
but really because this is what attracts
people to the space

177
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,429
becomes your clean space not be like or
the cumin seed 30 space

178
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,699
thing ago clueless me

179
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,899
some I'll room for projects is the same
kind of thing

180
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,179
people one on this basis to cluttered
then there's a lineup like to work on

181
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,699
that cool thing I want to hear

182
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:06,939
all the members

183
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:11,420
current views are you today with
expenses Winslow version being lost

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,819
and if you ask people whose hackers
bases

185
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:18,029
feeling these questions the montana
millions

186
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,329
and this is basic this goes beyond just
bookkeeping this is like me

187
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,770
collapsed play a Google spreadsheet is
cheap did literally impossible

188
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,939
so stark warning every some recording
I'll

189
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,020
all team members you know like this
whatever you want to collect dust

190
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,710
collector you know it's gonna be

191
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,930
I'll said

192
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,469
enforcing the rules is very important
I'll

193
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,980
it's not all Arsenal are

194
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,360
there some way thanks are also thanks
but basically

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,810
what this is arranging

196
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,130
up incentives are what you're doing

197
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,760
when you're managing a hackerspace which
is a distributed space

198
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,370
people working on very products very
interest

199
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,720
and varying degrees cleanliness
organization

200
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,860
knowledge is your manipulating news

201
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,810
so you're trying to you playing with
different variables to get people to do

202
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,050
the right thing and sort of my career
heard

203
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,569
in that direction without really
worrying too much about

204
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,670
veterans so what is actually like

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,759
to to run a hackerspace you know I'll

206
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,930
there some level is still used ball you
can see

207
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,630
I there's finances

208
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,399
looted and then yes a

209
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,470
YouTube anyone's seen the videos like my
peers his

210
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,079
once more with feeling I'll Mathers

211
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,099
this thats wat you know this right

212
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,589
you know this deal I'll

213
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,890
so challenges

214
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,550
are so again right incentives

215
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,920
so one thing that are you know

216
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,199
when you have a mailing list you know
this register

217
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,440
like 300 messages this muslim

218
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,550
I'll late world mourns pagers three
classes you know

219
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,740
when it's free everyone will just
consume as much as possible

220
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,070
and only world peace you know that's not
necessarily

221
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,010
victims I'll this doesn't work

222
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,800
for a number of reasons %uh the most
interesting name was

223
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,719
argument that it's free people will take
as much time as possible

224
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,730
is true for candy but it's not true for
education so

225
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,420
what actually happens is that nobody can
still recalls

226
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,400
how can this be you know it's free
what's wrong with you are

227
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,069
what's wrong is that %um incentive
structures almost up

228
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,440
so the funny thing is it it you pay a
small fee

229
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,589
then you your obligated to go close like
a life spent five dollars so

230
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,589
I might as well go on that Wednesday
were many

231
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,720
wears a beanie nothing gained

232
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,180
lost even some people just a whole and
then

233
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,760
instructors need to be paid to does and
then a short so then you've got like

234
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,980
these dudes the paper class and
instructors teach

235
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,260
for free and as for clinton

236
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,370
shallow and its workers delivers the
keycard

237
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,650
given in the mall you can see over the
webcam

238
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,850
like outside your space banging on the
door like that scene and Clark's

239
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,340
I'll and then of course

240
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,580
there are cost record right lying just

241
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,090
a bare minimum the lights turned on
that's about like

242
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,110
lines you know what a

243
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,270
this was more or less trial air

244
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,470
up one thing that I I'll by

245
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,660
during lost so many different ways winds

246
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,650
most people are going to go to easy
introductory class we're looking at

247
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,350
something

248
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,000
it doesn't even matter when that thing
is they're like by one standing 101

249
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,830
you know us tomorrow you know I got
something like thirty dollars

250
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,140
class lying that works than that but if
you have a series

251
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,540
where you're lying first you gonna stare
like and then you will step in class 2

252
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,849
you know that doesn't work so well as no
one shows up to class to

253
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:40,369
delay I spent that entire class looking
buttons

254
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:43,009
we can actually have a class thats

255
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,529
and its I'll

256
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,720
this long again cleaning up the space is
very important

257
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,230
I'll we still haven't quite figured out
sometimes

258
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,610
that one yet this is all trial there we
do try different

259
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,940
by the special evening insurance
projects moving

260
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,040
is important what typically happens is

261
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,069
you have any kind about open table

262
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,360
it will be filled with style answers
some we needn't

263
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,190
like that sort of like gold you

264
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,370
invariant actors site is this table

265
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,920
weaker people its up

266
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,420
so then this is kinda I'll we did this
is like a unique problem

267
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,649
to you are Packers bases and we

268
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,540
we this happen so often we came up with
the term or call a method

269
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,019
section and these are folks that show up

270
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,310
%uh to your her space and that this
happens

271
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,689
like I don't know late this does not
happen

272
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,079
in like a public space let this happen
to the hackerspace for some reason I've

273
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,439
never been anywhere

274
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,100
on earth except for free site where this
this happens

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,240
I'll law yes a

276
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,500
which that website is down that made me
so sad plywood

277
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,709
so I'll I mean the one that liked your
txt the mostly everything here is easy

278
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,270
to deal with I'll

279
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,030
the free energy people are kinda funny
because they're like I saw this YouTube

280
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,539
video and I want to come here

281
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,740
should about you know

282
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,890
yeah morals them I'll

283
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,920
but on the head on to me is like the
worst

284
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,760
is like I could belong is company owns
like will we have sort of something like

285
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,150
you know someone throws freeware at so
here's a pizza and light

286
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,230
go and you know you get awesome

287
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,440
goals I'll and

288
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,170
so you know upon I I have only

289
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,320
I actually emails like show I'll
individuals

290
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,280
I'll if the dome up

291
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,090
this is the after two years this was
like what are the most important lessons

292
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,580
I'll

293
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,040
was do not make every single person
happy I'll

294
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,510
eventually you will in somewhere but

295
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,090
don't make a little you have to me users

296
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,220
and you make class person and

297
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,260
these are the poor people that I try to
make you happy

298
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,870
on this might vary from actors basically
by

299
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,360
a one critical thing and

300
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,860
is obvious that means wouldn't and nice

301
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,409
me %uh this is very critical I had a
open house I am where I was giving a

302
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,420
tour and I was letting everybody know

303
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,440
networking millions are all law

304
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,610
and this dude what's around

305
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,889
any sleigh looking around like this

306
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,080
puts his hands on this yup you
definitely see myself

307
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,389
illness here link were you talking about

308
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,010
you know only we did not you cannot
install your plane

309
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,379
inside the middle space slings so you
know you wanna cater to a certain

310
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,250
pockets the highest the ones to use
tools and learn how to use

311
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,970
I'll students a while skills

312
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,400
the easiest for name enormous

313
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,740
what makes awesome the these are the
four people there

314
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,299
I told on everyone else like this I do
different things

315
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm usually not me was this is a reply

316
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,139
his word presentation will go all rails

317
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:39,399
as these is my own opinions I'll based
on the trends I'm seeing

318
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:42,830
and like the directional were right this

319
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,120
hackerspace thing is going for starters
it's not going to solve

320
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,760
huge I'll everyone saying it's the next
thing

321
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,440
in K 12 education on the site well no

322
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,940

323
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,460
so this is more focused online problems
in the future

324
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,240
axo II here any

325
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,380
better I had why thing

326
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,440
not that user

327
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,180
because

328
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,999
they think its genes is the

329
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,769
first answer that comes to mind I'll
most

330
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:27,120
the educators spoken with seem to you
believe that

331
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,350
if we put 3-pointers on upbeat rock

332
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,709
and label it a movie makers space

333
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,519
at rolling into a high-income

334
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,440

335
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,570
we will solve the education Collins
country and

336
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,178
your eyes are like chilling whoa I'll

337
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,100
and the yeah and that's just not the way
it works

338
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,649
%uh this is I'll really thorny
complicated issue that's multifaceted

339
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,758
at like touches on issues of class

340
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,779
race unlike you know we can all a

341
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,159

342
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,179
printers on electro

343
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,899

and or you know they're not going to let
anybody

347
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll that's one of the key reasons that
free size 18 and up

348
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,379
there's a key to 12 her space and open

436
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,090
or yet long that's lame less a challenge
in any shit system i mean that's

437
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,149
if you think about us the Stephenie
Meyer I'll

438
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,600
the United States so I mean the United
States

444
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,930
I was like this progression is what I'm
trying to say like

445
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,030
like the idea that somewhere along the
way

446
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,740
signing should be with the technology
and

447
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,800
you think about it that's the entire

448
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,879
Africa our site called now just so
really am

449
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,880
as an evening change so

450
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,690
I think that the next era in

451
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,360
actors haha the spaces the mall is due
thanks

452
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,310
i think is a major space usual things as
like always

453
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,350
you know any sort like additional cell

454
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,980
but what's really in a stick around
what's the next yr

455
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,570
is going to be going back to that
society and culture

456
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,679
because we saw signs culture Trinity
technology announced

457
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,000
owns coming back say culture and so

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,340
activism is actually going to be some
things

459
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,459
populism so I think we're going to see
people's rights you

460
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,160
especially in light 0 the NSA and
privacy i think people are going

461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,340
charge work george stories

462
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,939
i neva balance their I'll you know me

463
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,230

464
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,500
whites online it will never be able to
get back to you much

465
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,340
I don't I don't believe that so

466
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,419
will be interesting to see what what
this model

467
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,860
class as RC

468
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,649
graders you culture lyin eyes right

470
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,250

471
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,690
huge up we're getting into you

472

473
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,480
wearable devices less saying really
don't

474
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,660
there's no way to predict balanced
all-out we have no idea

475
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,309
what s how long people and their
relationships

476
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:29,340
maybe these two things are related right
you both like

477
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,389
jus people pushing their own

478
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,990
personal boundaries and and turn those

479
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,690
side I'll

480
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,170
and is when you're a few lines brands in
our ears pretty much

481
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,290
if you see any movies are you located
I'm pretty sure that sucks

482
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,940
%uh and

483
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,670
some hacker spaces will play a role and

484
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,160
yelling at us you problems that people

485
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,230
up society which is sorta why

486
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,160
were seen at I'll the problem the ICL

487
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,790
one thing that drives people to a
hackerspace is a day do not have created

488
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,440
I'll

489
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,850
or I'll or space

490
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,860
and wished you express creativity and

491
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,590
do their own research thinking about so
win and a loss

492
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,379
and that's what's wrong others yeah

493
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,920
I see people that write 50 miles
countryside

494
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,140
and they're not coming into this

495
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,550
at work pictures sure you note huh

496
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,040
the Comerica you have a call to us
getting

497
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,060
people's a smallish expressed creating

498
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,200
so you know are

499
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,550
all national work needs change

500
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,300
yes

501
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,149
I'll

502
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,200

me

525
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,070
there's actually a lol there's a space
in

526
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,669
outside reno though and I'll I'll

527
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,940
that is not like

528
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,510
space but they're an extremely large
celinda

529
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,990
year-round rule gmail or I'll

530
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,330
and I he also I don't know if they have
a harness

531
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,649
residence this you know imagine if
you're working on R Us

532
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,510
yeah building on that earlier

533
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,009
said that the ok

534
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:20,040
there and a bad

535
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,470
nombre and

536
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,750
guy

537
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,180
I'll you

538
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,010
i mean lol it was a 19

539
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,220
their think like I'll adding to it to an
extent

540
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,060
the notion that we can pull off I think
it was touching on

541
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,970
something that he said which was you
know this notion that like

542
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,410
we can actually live together like the
fact that notion is dead

543
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,590
I think it's just up style that make
sense

544
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,070
play people I don't think believe that
or at least

545
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,530
portions I'll believe that

546
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,629
awesome I

547
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,080
the had problems with New Harmony what

548
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,489
on mean to you

549
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:12,719
worry yet

550
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,489
Colorado site

551
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,629
their side

552
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:20,848
also so that's a huge that's a huge
difference

553
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,290
between those experiments and

554
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,599
actors bases because the the main

555
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,899
large experiment is that a hackerspace

556
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,899
not trying to group communes in the past

557
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,009
even lying walking an economy we had

558
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,270
you know communist commies you have like
Christian

559
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,949
on me you had all sorts of stuff right
like a spectrum

560
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,339
like they know what they were trying to
do was they were trying to prove that

561
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:49,730
the Utopia was collect

562
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,849
at this not what a hackerspace

563
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:57,310
you have just as easily have those goals
like on the whole

564
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,640
you can identify like what is the whole
stars places where they try to do to us

565
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,150
I'll we don't really have that right we
have just like

566
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,310
play we just have exploration and

567
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,578
I think that's really good I think it's
been nice

568
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:16,680
go back to I'll not right she

569
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,029
forces

570
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:26,380
the 13 their intentional

571
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,580
our although any re:

572
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,160
right mine

573
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,868
a ideology

574
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:37,000
that by now are only brass

575
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,550
well that

576
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,670
here

577
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,010
there

578
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,420
me

579
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,010
in our that for me great

580
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,860
at I L or we should pay

581
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,840
word all are where anyway

582
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,020
better for Danielle not

583
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,759
certainly

584
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,660
all on me

585
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,899
I L

586
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,460
it more or

587
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,880
that

588
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,560
yeah and i also think that like harlem

589
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,410
the purpose a espy's Canada figure that
out

590
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,970
for the community that's operating so

591
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,189
if you want to develop community

592
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,140
%uh say robbers that's going to be a
very different stages

593
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,430
the community of people who want G

594
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,129
artis so well

595
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,510
spaces point up some lunch rules similar

596
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,540
missions world's issues clearly

597
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,230
the society those many societies and
cultures are going to develop

598
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,460
believed their dad yeah

599
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,900

I'll

606
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,520
like for me like makers local is now
playing like bananas inspirations for me

607
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,009
inside because it reminds me that

608
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:30,070
we can growing I forget just exactly how
many members

609

612
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,210
and that's like how many more times
population but that speaks to a certain

613
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,320
extent I'll

614
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,820
the problem are right calamity

615
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,960
wages right now but still I me

616
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,200
there's no reason right or at least

617
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,770
shimmy but that always makes me sick
examine well

618
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,320
waters mile blind spots so it just
reminds me

619
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,680
like lookin spaces like that and even in
places I

620
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,980
small in Huntsville this still have the
same type II

621
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,630
membership numbers amway people that
really support the community so

622
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,740
there's a space really kinda look under
the microscope to play

623
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,200
what makes you guys it and in all cases
that's the

took that into account only word

639
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,480
trying to design mom R Us remarks
organizational structure

640

I'll we try and a hierarchy

641
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,450
up because we were inspired by week bob
Bennett says

642
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,069
while I'll which touched on those topics

643
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,540
so we like well it worked for the higher
are you should work for us

644
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,130
but the thing is slated there's a
fundamental difference there

645
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,310
and I think that up

646
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,570
that sort and organize for a singular
purpose

647
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,540
right is to get its people like and

648
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,580
if we were to really try to you engineer
instrument approach

649
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,250
we just gonna like so I had some ideas

650
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,950
and we're about to get a new board
actually four days

651
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,359
precise our that shaky cell

652
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,010
with those try to work with them and see
if we can come up with

653
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:10,250
so the menu model for organizes

654
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,520
these is as higher years no

655
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,490
mostly because we had where where this
weird world juncture

656
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,169
where maybe you guys win

657
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,660
this problem makers local but up being
really the size

658
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,670
and big enough to start having the big
problems

659
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,869
from size but were not large enough

660
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:33,990
to have enough leaders come in and fill
the holes me

661
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,720
in orange managed all so that's kind of
an interesting article

662
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,759
it's almost like I I sound like a broken
record sometimes

663
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,250
someone let's just adding numbers in
July justice

664
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,829
cell even though I know that's not the
right answer

665
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:55,220
like its lay trying to large numbers of
the pearls

666
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,060
their ratio years

667
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,620
I don't I don't know I really just you
know the answer to that

668
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,850
I think I think it really isn't I'll a
ratio

669
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,850
so much as it is engineering is

670
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:15,390
and a one example would be lying

671
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,810
distributing I'll management girls right

672
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,049
that's something that's typically run by
one person

673
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,090
efforts I know me okay

674
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,890
and the I've been taking names trying to

675
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,430
spread al to people and that's

676
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,440
you know yet to do that in a way that's
Town Hall doesn't stop people from doing

677
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,600
it

678
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,250
easy for them too easy so they don't you

679
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:49,250
yesterday it's a lot of trial lawyers

680
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:59,640
well

681
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,799
are

682
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,550
me

683
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,900
yeah

684
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,859
at all

685
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,650
p

686
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,809
me

687
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:18,840
level

688
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,660
warm

689
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,879
organization

690
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,220
yeah my stage

691
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,540
yeah we call those give them and I
moments

692
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,810
it's a you know like the a classic
example is we have an open house Tuesday

693
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,340
night

694
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,280
one guy was like I have an
internet-connected calling me here

695
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,340
and some other guy use like Madonna
writes all

696
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,700
for when the guys like well and I know

697
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,080
software yeah and they got a

698
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,090
I mean like up

699
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,260
the one thing that we are focusing on at
least for this coming year is

700
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,100
we divide our space things activities
but now we're going to try to see if I

701
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,680
can get people excited about

702
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,859
cheney does pipelines so

703
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,060
1 pipeline that we have is we have a
couple people early news

704
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,210
cost play trying on histories

705
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,150
usually so well drug test

706
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,620
up these books make a living so they
were talking about

707
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,540
well as have 3d printing a master's

708
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,100
mold making and doing arms parties

709
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,920
does like that sounds awesome as you
touch on some

710
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,350
tools and people that you know that will
change we learnt so much along the way

711
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,850
so that's kind of way one approach we're
taking a nap

712
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,420
much I'll quayle

713
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,870
I like the tank mines

714
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,250
there

715
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,100
where thing

716
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,790
yes software like well

717
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,040
days that so

718
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,350
here so when the one in the nest dreams

719
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,839
about for spaces that is this

720
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,990
little ones of course and I G books

721
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,870
and nobody wants to work on software
because

722
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,569
and the sad thing is

723
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,800
you still need to because well

724
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,320
that nature your projects and your
building is very different

725
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,310
%uh you still mean that's all expertise
and knowledge

726
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,549
its whether even its just like

727
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,870
like and if you guys I'll becomes this

728
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:39,859
a talk today he was talking about well
he didn't help skills like

729
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,730
hold on the data from jail any enemy

730
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,490
obstacle my hand well as CBO's a

731
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,399
free site is actually lucky in that we
do have while some people

732
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,820
from Saul background I would say about
it than 60 percent among members

733
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,510
although

734
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,700
explicitly software developers 10
construction and building

735
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,490
making skills

736
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:06,269
fabricators so that's really hard to do

737
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,399
especially like their space is entirely
founded by

738
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,510
solid dollars preside started I'll

739
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,150
it was a magical and lol

740
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,789
likes of Google write something and that
quickly

741
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,940
work

742
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,280
also I didn't know what they were trying
you

743
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,350
because I won't bore you with a shared
workspace

744
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:34,310
war at some point to you missus be like
happen while

745
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,529
like style law or call the Nat'l

746
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,780
something by it yeah I don't know I
think like

747
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,090
sort of not allowing them to focus and
mission is also while

748
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,650
a big part I knew that

749
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,750
like a sparse culture goes to you like

750
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,320
I think one weird thing that's happened
as we have been able to set up

751
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,730
male a pipeline you minutes was
important

752
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,230
because certain members that are into
the

753
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,260
they have pipelines where they take
decisive shift in China

754
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,650
and then get orders many back setback
they don't feel like they want to bring

755
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,120
that

756
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,259
free psychic if they feel like well
maybe a minute

757
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,500
more people doing the snow p Mike

758
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,260
probably going to make the same product
you doing so

759
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,040
thats want to leave they so we get like

760
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,070
resistance on doing certain things is
people

761
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:36,079
you like friends its its all so

762
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,190
yeah I'll all

763
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,619
on only home

764
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,380
me days

765
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,380
is

766
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,580
and yes

767
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,710
yeah I'll K

768
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,600
I identical where you I'll %uh

769
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,880
I wonder that is popular I'll

770
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,790
buttoned up me hell anything on that I
feel like

771
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,910
and this translates Highlands I feel
like

772
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,049
a hot spaces Isles

773
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,130
and should hardly Copts

774
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,260
if people want to make money a lot of
hackerspace

775
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,740
really terrible place to do that that
said

776
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:30,209
I'll for one reason like listing
intellectual property the

777
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,090
you were actually running machine shop
where people have intellectual property

778
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,830
concerns

779
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,460
airspace poorly with really do that

780
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,880
you know you need to help like a
security system problem

781
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,220
offices all that for structured to
protect intellectual property starts

782
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:46,779
adding up

783
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,650
means for cost so well I don't tell
people that they can't do that stuff

784
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,650
resign I told them you're probably
better off doing open source

785
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,450
just because then there's no

786
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,600
worry about okay well as problems

787
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,930
and you can still profit of open source
all

788
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,450
anyways so it's kinda like I'll but I
think playing

789
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,529
atoll recently in one of the directors
of a

790
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,580
family lab and sunshine labs over it

791
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,880
Orlando and she said a what they do

792
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,230
yes it's a little like this in my life
relationship

793
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,290
I'll which I guess ago whose

794
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,259
a said about two different actors I'll

795
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,270
months August you the different you have
little Marshall Space

796
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,880
was gonna

797
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,410
bit yeah make

798
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,759
say

799
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,580
mine

800
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,770
yet is a commercial space play accepted
a

801
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,890
but I mean that's good though because

802
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:00,670
way you mind a while is I think you want
to be in an environment where

803
