00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
adversary emulation and purple teaming

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
and now we're coming to you with the

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
purple team maturity model

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,239
see over the last year we've really been

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,480
telling people about purple teaming and

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
collaboration and the reasons you should

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
do adversary emulation

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
how to do it and we've gotten such great

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,960
feedback a lot of organizations

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
are seeing the value of doing purple

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,199
teaming and have started doing it

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
in purple team exercises but what we get

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
a lot of

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
is okay what do we do now

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,280
and the benefit of working at a

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
company that sells to customers

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,080
and clients enterprise level but also

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
does some professional services is we

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
get to see the entire spectrum

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,400
and speak with all of these amazing

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,119
people

uh red team course uh back in the day i

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
wrote a book on an operating system you

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
should not be using because it's end of

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
life

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
uh but still i like to put it because at

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
the end i wrote a book you know

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
was a lot of work would never do it

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
again do not recommend uh

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
anyway over to tim tell us a little bit

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
about yourself

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
so uh i'm tim schultz i am the adversary

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,480
emulation lead

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,680
here at scythe uh and prior to

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
scythe i've worked at uh mostly uh what

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
we call ffrdc's are federally funded

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
research and development centers

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
and so while not as many people have

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
heard of like sandia national labs of

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
course people have heard

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
of mitre miter attack team the miter

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
attack evaluations

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,480
effort so i was lucky enough to be able

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,959
to work

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
with the teams uh while i was at miter

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,799
uh doing that

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
so i've got about probably a decade of

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,159
experience in this space about

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
six years in adversary emulation and

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
sort of red teaming

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,480
so uh yeah super excited to share with

101
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,040
you

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
as george mentioned what what we've been

103
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
working on

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
i was super excited to hire tim so we

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
gave him the coolest title

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
ever adversary emulation lead i love it

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
um actually met tim uh at the first

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
purple team summit so shows you the

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
importance of networking and

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
talking to folks i know we're still

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,239
virtual but definitely

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
talk to us uh we're we're very open uh

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
always happy to help and and give

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
feedback so uh

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
do ask questions as we go uh the benefit

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,000
of having two speakers

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
is that we can see the questions and

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
answer them sometimes even live

119
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
so what are we talking about today well

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,680
this is totally tim's slide because

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
he's very methodical he likes answering

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,959
the why

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,000
the what and the how so the why is why

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,280
does purple team need a maturity model

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,120
that's going to be our first item i'm

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
going to talk a little bit about that

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
now i'm going to turn it over to tim to

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
talk about the what

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,479
what is the maturity model and then of

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,520
course we want an

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
actual practical way of using it with

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,639
examples because

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
this is red team village and we know you

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
love examples and actual use cases

135
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
so we will cover the how so to get

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
started

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
the why why does purple team

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
need a maturity model well i said

139
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,479
earlier right

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,800
we've kind of figured out that it makes

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
sense to

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,360
collaborate with other teams

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
right and we learned this the hard way

144
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
back when i was at city group

145
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,240
we had our blue team right our security

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
operations center

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,759
there you see the blue unicorns again i

148
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
told you you're gonna see these

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
throughout the

150
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
uh presentation um and they're in charge

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
of defending right

152
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,639
then we had our red team our offensive

153
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
team our offensive team

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,120
was in charge of at first finding

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
vulnerabilities and technology

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
then doing things like social

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
engineering then we got to a point where

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,960
we were testing response processes

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
but we did all this from a stealth

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
perspective the blue team didn't know we

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,759
were doing this

162
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
because we wanted to realistically test

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
them right

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
and all of that brings value so don't

165
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,720
think that what we're presenting here

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
today means

167
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
don't do vulnerability assessment and

168
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
don't do reddit tv no that's not what

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
we're saying

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
then many organizations also have

171
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
brought in

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
cyber threat intelligence and cyber

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
through intelligence

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
has evolved as well from providing just

175
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
indicators of compromise to the blue

176
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,680
team

177
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,800
to also providing things for the red

178
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,199
team

179
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
such as tactics techniques and

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
procedures

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
we want to know what threat actors are

182
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
out there which ones are likely to

183
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,120
attack

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
us and then get those behaviors so that

185
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
we can emulate them in our red team

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,280
exercises

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
so this is the infosec team of today and

188
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,639
you might have all of these internal you

189
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
might have some of these that

190
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,199
you pay outside right uh vendors either

191
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
a red team that comes in you might have

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
managed security services

193
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
or managed detection response or even a

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
vendor cyber threat intel team and

195
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
that's okay right this talk

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,880
will apply for uh for all three of these

197
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
so

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
how did we get started well we got

199
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
started by saying

200
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
look don't just do

201
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
blue team cti and red in silos

202
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
let's collaborate right for the longest

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
time and probably in the last year and a

204
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,560
half or even

205
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
since that first purple team summit

206
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
where i gave the first talk on running a

207
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,319
purple team exercise

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
we said that purple team is a virtual

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,599
team right

210
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,599
where you the following teams are going

211
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,960
to work together and they're going to

212
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
collaborate right

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
those three unicorns i showed earlier

214
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
right the cyber threat intelligence team

215
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
does the research learns about a

216
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,440
adversary that's likely to attack you

217
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
they

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
look up those ttps those behaviors

219
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,319
tactics techniques and procedures

220
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
and they provide them to the red and the

221
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
blue t

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
the red team then looks through that

223
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,520
creates a

224
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,039
plan and emulates

225
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,759
those adversary behaviors while the blue

226
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,319
team

227
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
who are the defenders right the security

228
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
operations center hunting

229
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
defer or managed services all work

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,840
together

231
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,280
and we published this research

232
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
into what is called the purple team

233
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
exercise framework it's free you can

234
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
download it right now

235
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
and it should get you started in your

236
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
first purple team experience because a

237
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,199
lot of people hadn't really heard of

238
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,160
purple teaming

239
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
this was a great place to start right

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
starts with cyber threat intel

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
then preparation which is very important

242
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
when you bring everyone together

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
in that one exercise they're taking time

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,000
off of their day so

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
you want to ensure that you are

246
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
using their time to the best right be

247
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
the most efficient

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,159
so you execute the exercise and then you

249
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,719
have

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
lessons learned so how did this first

251
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
purple team

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
exercise go well it has a

253
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
flow as we can see here in the next

254
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
slide

255
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
that first the cyber threat intel team

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,000
provides a threat actor with the

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
capability intent and opportunity to

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
attack

259
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
you're all already sitting together so

260
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
you have a tabletop discussion this gets

261
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,399
you know breaks the ice say okay

262
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,200
look at this ttp if someone were to do

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
run dll32

264
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
right for a dll it's a sign binary it's

265
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,839
one of those

266
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
what we call low bass living off the

267
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
land binaries and scripts

268
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
and would we be able to detect this so

269
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
the cti team provides that the red team

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
says all right this is

271
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
you know this is a low bass this is a

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
file that's on all our windows systems

273
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
then the blue team says well i think we

274
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,880
might be able to detect it with our edr

275
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
because our edr logs that run dll32

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
and then sends the log to our central

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,399
log aggregator say splunk in this case

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
and then we have an alert on splunk

279
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
that's gonna show us

280
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,399
that's fantastic right sometimes that's

281
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
not going to be the case sometimes

282
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,480
you're going to say hey

283
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
what happens if we run this and be like

284
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
i don't think we have any detections for

285
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,640
that

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
but that's great you want to document

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,360
those expected defenses

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
then the red team is going to share

289
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,120
their screen and because they did that

290
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,079
preparation

291
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
they're going to be able to emulate that

292
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,640
for you very quickly and very easily

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
they're going to explain how it works

294
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,040
right run dll32 again it's part of the

295
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,480
windows operating system

296
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
and it's used to load dlls so we've

297
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
before the exercise we created this dll

298
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
that when it executes it's going to

299
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
establish command and control

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
with rc2 server over https

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
this is the ip address this is the host

302
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
name this is the domain

303
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
this is the port right we provide all

304
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
those iocs and we show it

305
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,440
so cti is learning how the red team

306
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
operates and how the attacker operates

307
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
the blue team is learning and seeing and

308
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,720
has all these iocs and

309
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
these indicators and then once the

310
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
execution is complete

311
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
the blue team looks for those indicators

312
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
of behavior

313
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
and sees if it matches the expectation

314
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,320
right

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
did run dll32 get logged by the edr

316
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,399
yes or no yes great did it get sent to

317
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,040
splunk

318
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,360
yeah i did i i could see it here when i

319
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,399
run a query

320
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,200
but there was no alert there should have

321
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
been lr why was there an

322
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,800
alert well let's look into it oh my gosh

323
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
look this is the reason why there was no

324
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,360
alert

325
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,120
maybe there was drift who knows right or

326
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,079
in the event that uh you had no local

327
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
logging for instance then you do

328
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
detection engineering

329
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
where you create these security controls

330
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,519
for those gaps

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
and then you test it again one of the

332
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
things about purple team exercises is

333
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,959
you want to use a platform

334
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,360
that is consistent and reliable so you

335
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
can re-execute that

336
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
same exact ttp over and over as you do

337
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
detection engineering

338
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
once you do have a security control then

339
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
you can train the people

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
your sock folks right what to do when

341
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,360
that happens

342
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,240
go through the process etc right the

343
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
next slide

344
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
was actually an image created by tim

345
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
that i totally stole and love because it

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,440
says

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
everything i just went through in a much

348
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
prettier way right

349
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,519
you have an exercise coordinator

350
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,079
exercise

351
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
coordinator is very important for purple

352
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
team exercises because they bring

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
everyone together from the cti team to a

354
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,320
blue team

355
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
to red team they put the proposal

356
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
together they ensure the exercise is

357
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,240
running smoothly

358
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
highly recommend that's a dedicated

359
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,760
position then

360
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
you do the tabletop like i said red team

361
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
emulates

362
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
blue team shows the detection of those

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,240
behaviors

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
if there weren't any you do detection

365
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
engineering and then

366
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,920
you repeat them right which is fantastic

367
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
the next slide you're gonna see

368
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,839
if you document all these ttps each

369
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
each week of your purple team engagement

370
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
or however often you do a purple team

371
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,240
right

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
we know some organizations that do it

373
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
once a year some organizations that do

374
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,399
it quarterly some that do it monthly

375
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
but the point is that you're documenting

376
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
where you stand

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
at the beginning of that exercise and

378
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,680
then

379
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,639
where you are at the end of the exercise

380
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
and you show that improvement

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
now this chart i know goes up and down

382
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
and the reason it goes down is because

383
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,560
we were

384
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
baselining we were going back to

385
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
original system that we had

386
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
and in that system there was very little

387
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
detections so

388
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,560
you can see uh the improvement and that

389
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
was very very important so

390
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
we finished doing this purple team

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,959
exercise everyone's satisfied it's like

392
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,800
wow i learned a lot from the blue team i

393
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
learned a lot from cti

394
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
i learned a lot from the red team high

395
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,360
fives

396
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,839
all right let's get back to work because

397
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
you know exercise is over

398
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,360
and then what happens right

399
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
maybe another ad hoc exercises in six

400
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
months or in a year

401
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,959
or you could turn it over to tim

402
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,680
to tell us what we are seeing most

403
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,959
enterprises

404
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
and uh small and medium businesses

405
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,000
actually heading

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,199
towards well

407
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
and to to sort of lead off with what

408
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
george mentioned

409
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,959
some of the challenges in this space are

410
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,519
that we

411
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
we do come together for that event we

412
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
see all of the

413
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
the greatness that purple teaming has to

414
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,800
offer as an exercise

415
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
and then everyone goes back to their

416
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
silos and so

417
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
often times purple teaming will expose

418
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
some some pretty big gaps whether it's

419
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,399
in detections

420
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
or whether it's in if you have a really

421
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,079
mature

422
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
set of defensive technologies and stuff

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
like that maybe

424
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,199
the tests that you're running up against

425
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,079
it are are not mature enough to sort of

426
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,880
actually stress it enough to to see if

427
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,079
there's any gaps

428
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
and that's partially because all these

429
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
teams are independent and so they're

430
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
developing capability independently they

431
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,399
have different levels of maturity

432
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
and so the challenge is how do we

433
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
measure that and

434
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
put it together in the current landscape

435
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,040
and i think

436
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
the answer is we can't really do that

437
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,079
with

438
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
all these teams oftentimes if you have

439
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
a large enough organization or even a

440
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,959
small organization

441
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
everyone is so consumed trying to do the

442
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,360
things that are within their

443
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,920
their current job that it's tough to

444
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
collaborate

445
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
and communicate because it's optional

446
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
it's something that

447
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
teams can decide whether or not they

448
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
have the time to do

449
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
and i think that is sort of the the core

450
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,800
issue

451
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
that purple teaming addresses is

452
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,440
bringing all those people together

453
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
and so the information security teams of

454
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
tomorrow

455
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,959
are going to be this blended purple team

456
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
uh all of these backgrounds red teaming

457
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,880
blue teaming

458
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
cyber threat intelligence as a dedicated

459
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,320
team

460
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
and so that's where for instance as

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
george mentioned with

462
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,759
uh not just large enterprises that have

463
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,519
you know dedicated teams for all of

464
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,399
these to

465
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
you know uh carve off a couple people

466
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
and say all right you're going to be

467
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
now in our new purple team i think for

468
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,759
small businesses this is the way

469
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
to move forward because you need to

470
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
understand

471
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,279
not only uh what are we defending

472
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
against but how are we doing it and so

473
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,839
we're going to show you

474
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
a couple of different ways first what

475
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,759
the purple maturity model

476
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
is so you can measure and see how we're

477
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
going to

478
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,519
continue to build these teams and then

479
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
we're going to go through an example

480
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
that's going to highlight how a current

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,759
team would use this model and hopefully

482
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,600
you can see yourself in there or your

483
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,320
team

484
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
and how how you can progress using this

485
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
new model

486
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,920
so that's where overall our our

487
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
sort of argument here on why there

488
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,120
should be

489
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
a purple maturity model is that there's

490
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,720
fundamentally

491
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
different mentality because of that

492
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,560
communication because of that

493
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
collaboration

494
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
than there is with the current red and

495
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
blue teams and so that's not to say that

496
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,680
red and blue teams aren't can't be

497
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,759
effective you're still going to need

498
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,720
people that have

499
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
the background you're going to need uh

500
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
red and blue teams ideally to

501
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,000
sort of do additional things outside of

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,560
what

503
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,079
the the purple team mean that we're

504
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,680
going to highlight is and for blue team

505
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
that could be things like

506
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
for instance setting firewall exceptions

507
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,039
and anything that's going to involve

508
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
uh information technology administration

509
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,880
and things like that

510
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
uh for red teaming you know if they're

511
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
depending on how it

512
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,079
sophisticated advance your your

513
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
organization is you're going to need

514
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
dedicated people that are just trying to

515
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
break in the entire time

516
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,599
and are doing additional research on top

517
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,199
of the threat research we're going to

518
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,319
talk about

519
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,960
but overall this is sort of the starting

520
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
this is that core

521
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,799
core set of skills and expertise that we

522
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,840
think that

523
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
are going to be required for most

524
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,440
information security teams moving

525
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
forward

526
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
and so with that we're going to dive

527
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
into the

528
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
what so what is this maturity model that

529
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,559
we keep

530
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
teasing and talking about and so with

531
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,960
that let's walk through the purple team

532
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
story a little bit as george has already

533
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
talked to so i'm not going to spend a

534
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,559
lot of time on it but it's basically

535
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,120
been

536
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,520
the set of three teams sort of coming to

537
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
the infosec

538
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
scene so with blue teaming sort of being

539
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,160
the first

540
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
set of larger teams and then having red

541
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,679
teams to

542
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,919
address that in some space we knew that

543
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,760
you know we needed to test our defenses

544
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,160
so

545
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
of course we're gonna set up a dedicated

546
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
team and then

547
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
uh cyber threat intelligence has sort of

548
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
come along and and really evolved and

549
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
grown over the past decade

550
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
into into his own series of capabilities

551
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
and teams beyond indicators of

552
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
compromise as george mentioned

553
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
and so that's where they really have

554
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
brought context to both the

555
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,919
information that they were providing the

556
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
blue team and

557
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
the red team with the tactics techniques

558
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
and procedures

559
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
that the red team should be emulating

560
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
and so again

561
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,280
this is sort of all come together under

562
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
the umbrella term that we like to call

563
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
purple teaming now in this

564
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
world where you have a purple team what

565
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
are they doing how do we measure that

566
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
the way we've broken this down is into

567
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
two major categories

568
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
and that is threat understanding and

569
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
detection understanding

570
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,760
and so for folks that have a red team

571
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
background you might easily see yourself

572
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
within the thread understanding space

573
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,039
if you've got a blue team background you

574
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
might see yourself in the detection

575
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,679
engineering space

576
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,080
i'll get to sort of the area where i

577
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
think cyber threat intelligence provides

578
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,120
the most value in this model as well

579
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,240
but overall the idea here is that this

580
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
is going to be a team that needs to

581
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
leverage both

582
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,840
consistently and as equally as possible

583
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
and so we're going to dive into how do

584
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
we measure the maturity

585
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
of our capability in each of these

586
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,840
spaces

587
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
and so we did do that by we have a three

588
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,280
level

589
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
model and so overall though with

590
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,840
detection engineering just uh our

591
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,799
understanding

592
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,679
to dive into what that is before we go

593
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,360
into how do you measure it

594
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
is overall you'll see a lot of questions

595
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,480
here

596
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
around that that are very similar to

597
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
what threat hunters what blue teams are

598
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,159
doing right now

599
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,600
although you'll see a couple of things

600
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,159
like have detections been validated

601
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,080
and so detection understanding is all

602
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
about trying to understand

603
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
what is a situational awareness on your

604
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
network what are the assets that you

605
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
have control over and what are they

606
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
doing

607
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
and so from the same standpoint of the

608
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
threat understanding

609
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
overall the question here is what

610
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
adversaries are targeting

611
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
our industry what are the tests that we

612
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
should be building based

613
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,960
on the capabilities the technology and

614
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
tooling that they're using

615
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
in order to test their defenses and

616
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
again what detections have been

617
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,640
validated

618
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
there's intentionally some crossover

619
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
there because that's really what's going

620
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,280
to be needed between

621
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,559
the two teams having a lopsided team as

622
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
far as skill sets and expertise

623
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
is not going to be something that's

624
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
going to be necessarily a benefit to

625
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
your overall purple team

626
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,400
and so we'll get into that and so this

627
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,919
is where we're building our model this

628
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
is that first level of maturity

629
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
maturity level one is deployment and so

630
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,440
this is where most teams start so your

631
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
team may not be here right now but this

632
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
is probably where your team started

633
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
deployment is uh about using someone

634
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,039
else's tools

635
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
and so can you take uh and someone

636
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
else's tools technologies process

637
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
and deploy it within your environment

638
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
for some effect

639
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
and so this is where this could be

640
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
vendor tools uh

641
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
that are that are a new tool you're

642
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
trying trying out to see whether

643
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,559
it does provide value it can be

644
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
something like an open source tool

645
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,520
where you again are attempting to bring

646
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
out some additional value

647
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
or cover some gap and then uh and then

648
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,760
it could also be something like

649
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
indicators of compromise right can you

650
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,559
deploy

651
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
indicators of compromise in your

652
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
environment to have some effects can

653
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,559
they look for

654
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
uh those and so that's sort of how we

655
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
span deployment here and i'm gonna go

656
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,400
over an example

657
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
uh using two open source projects that

658
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,080
is going to to sort of showcase this

659
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
maturity model this one two and three in

660
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,480
both

661
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
the threat understanding and the

662
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
detection understanding

663
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
so level two is integration so this is

664
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,159
building on top of deployment this is

665
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
after something has been deployed you've

666
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
used a little bit and you've decided

667
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,559
this is something that we want and in

668
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,720
fact we want to achieve greater effect

669
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,600
by putting

670
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
by integrating this with something else

671
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,039
that we already have

672
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,120
maybe this is two tools that you've had

673
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
that two teams have used that have sort

674
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,640
of been on a collision course and

675
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
integrating them is going to provide

676
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
additional uh you know people hours or

677
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
it's going to require less expertise in

678
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
order to get spun up on

679
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
one interface instead of two and so

680
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
that's where this integration really

681
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,559
comes into effect but of course it is

682
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,799
building on this initial deployment

683
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,360
and so that's again this is can you

684
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
integrate a new process you know can you

685
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,520
integrate something like miter attack

686
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,679
i mentioned before that i was going to

687
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,200
highlight where i thought

688
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
uh cyber threat intelligence was could

689
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
really play a role and this is

690
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,840
this role at level two integration for

691
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
both the threat understanding detection

692
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,120
understanding

693
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
understanding where you need the points

694
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,039
of integration

695
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,720
and where for instance you have

696
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,679
threat modeling is going to help help

697
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,720
you identify

698
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
where the areas that we have gaps that

699
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,320
we need to address

700
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
where we need to combine two resources

701
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,640
in order to

702
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
achieve those greater results and this

703
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,679
is where again

704
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,200
cyber threat intelligence can really

705
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
play a key role in providing context

706
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,760
around both threat and detection

707
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
understanding

708
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,159
to help with identifying key integration

709
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,799
points

710
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,640
or showcasing how those integration

711
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
points can provide even more value than

712
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,440
they are right now

713
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
and then our final level is level three

714
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,000
is creation

715
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
so creation this is the sort of you know

716
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
ultimate it's the the top level for each

717
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,240
because

718
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
if you can create novel tests and

719
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
techniques based on

720
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,320
your integration based on your

721
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,480
deployment again or building up here

722
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
that's that it allows you to adapt to

723
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
new techniques to new threat groups that

724
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
are going to appear in this space and

725
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,039
that

726
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
overall means that you're going to be a

727
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,400
highly adaptive team

728
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
which is going to be really important in

729
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
this industry and in this space

730
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
for continuing to adapt to new

731
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
adversaries you know and that's

732
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,039
that's something that's that is sort of

733
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,720
why it's the pinnacle here

734
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
is that in addition to deploying and

735
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,240
integrating what you're doing

736
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
you have a team that can extend uh

737
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
extend these tools

738
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,159
extend these technologies or processes

739
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,400
to be tailored to your environment

740
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,880
to whoever you are going up against and

741
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,440
that is

742
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
really really important especially again

743
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
as we continue to adapt

744
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,039
because adversaries are unfortunately

745
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,240
have been well funded

746
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
so they are adapting as well

747
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
so with that i'm going to dive into two

748
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,520
open source

749
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
projects that a lot of you are probably

750
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,279
familiar with especially from the red

751
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,240
team side

752
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
uh you've probably a few times been

753
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
caught by some sigma rules

754
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,559
and you may have started your journey or

755
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
may use something like atomic red team

756
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
to help transition some of the testing

757
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
you're doing so

758
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
that the blue teams and the folks that

759
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
you're running tests on

760
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,200
can run similar things in the future

761
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
so the first one we're going to dive

762
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
into is the detection understanding and

763
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,919
sigma

764
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,640
and so the deployment phase here is not

765
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,120
just

766
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,919
deploying uh sigma rules but it's

767
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,200
setting up that

768
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,080
scene setting up that edr deploying it

769
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
with what it's gotten seen

770
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
can you get those results and so then

771
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
you can work on

772
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,120
building out and integrating something

773
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
like sigma either

774
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
into just the standard edr uh

775
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
and and your general logging and and

776
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,679
scanning

777
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
or it could do something like if you

778
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,799
have a sandbox environment

779
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,080
making sure that you're running these

780
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
rules against it to to see what you're

781
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,400
introducing into your environment

782
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,120
and so again it's it's sort of making

783
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,559
sure that you're providing

784
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,120
additional value at each stage that this

785
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
tool this technology this process is

786
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,880
providing additional value

787
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
and that's where we get to the pinnacle

788
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,480
here is developing your

789
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,960
own tools giving back to the community

790
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,840
by

791
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,440
releasing potentially new ways of

792
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
building detections around specific

793
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,279
techniques or procedures

794
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
and then of course developing your own

795
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,799
internal

796
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,200
sigma rules if that's something that you

797
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
have a very specific use case that you

798
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
want to be able to

799
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
detect on this is where your team is

800
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,640
going to continue

801
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,679
to work and build and play and so that's

802
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,799
why again

803
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
creation is sort of sort of the what

804
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
we're driving towards here

805
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
and and that is because you are able to

806
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,640
adapt

807
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
anything that you're bringing in to your

808
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,120
team

809
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
so and of course then we'll move over to

810
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,919
atomic red team

811
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,039
so uh most organizations start out here

812
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,240
and this is we've had a lot of

813
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
conversations with people that are

814
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,720
just building out their initial tests

815
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
and so atomic red team is

816
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
is builds off of if you're not familiar

817
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
with the project uh atomic testing

818
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
in software engineering where you are

819
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,080
building a very

820
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,360
small uh focused test case that's that's

821
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,799
only gonna test one thing

822
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
and so that's where you can either use

823
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
uh you can use atomic red team to test

824
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,000
like a singular

825
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,440
technique and it'll run through a bunch

826
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,679
of procedures or you can test a single

827
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,799
procedure

828
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,399
and so that's that's sort of the

829
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
starting point can you deploy

830
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,520
atomic red team to test your detections

831
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,919
integrating that might be ensuring that

832
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
anytime you are building new detections

833
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
that you are running an atomic red team

834
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
to test whether it works

835
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,440
or you're using atomic red team in your

836
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,120
detection development pipeline to make

837
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,520
sure

838
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
all of your detections work as they

839
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,880
probably should

840
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,399
this is where i'll give a shout out to

841
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,919
our friends at splunk

842
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,320
who have released attack range to help

843
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,600
with this exact

844
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
uh challenge because as george mentioned

845
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
earlier

846
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
maybe you have detections that you have

847
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
built over time and you think should be

848
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
firing an

849
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
alert for instance in his example and

850
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
then when you are building new

851
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,919
detections maybe

852
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,960
you change some of the logic to fit fit

853
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,399
some new one that you're you're

854
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,279
developing

855
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,520
and it changes previous tests wouldn't

856
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,559
it be great if

857
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,200
you had an automated way to see just how

858
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
big of an impact those types of changes

859
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,440
have

860
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
and that's where integrating these tools

861
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
together can really have

862
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
a greater effect because you'll be able

863
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
to identify and see that immediately

864
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
and not when a red team comes in and

865
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
exposes that

866
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,559
you know six months later and hopefully

867
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,159
you haven't had any adversaries that

868
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
have been able to

869
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
uh skirt by without without being seen

870
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,960
and so this is that really important

871
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,720
part again building value

872
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
continuing to build on top of your

873
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,159
previous work

874
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,559
and of course our top one here is

875
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,279
creating

876
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,840
and developing brand new atomic red team

877
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,960
techniques

878
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,760
so a lot of adversaries depending on who

879
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,080
they're

880
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,240
targeting how they what their normal

881
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,760
mode of operations are

882
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,679
they're going to use slightly different

883
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,440
variations of things

884
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
whether it's different flags whether

885
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,039
they like to obfuscate

886
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,440
things a certain way especially when we

887
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
look at like invoke obfuscation and some

888
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,480
of that

889
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,960
those were based off of initial uh i

890
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
think the initial talk talked about

891
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,360
uh when it was released that this was a

892
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,120
lot of financial sector

893
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
uh threat actors that were using these

894
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,399
techniques

895
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,600
and so that's going to potentially be

896
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,919
you're going to develop these new atomic

897
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,520
red team techniques that are very

898
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
specific to your industry they're

899
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,640
specific to your use case

900
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
and the groups that are targeting you

901
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,240
and so again

902
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
that's why this is so critical is these

903
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,320
continue to build off each other and

904
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,720
you will mature your level of threat

905
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,919
understanding

906
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,440
and uh and detection understanding

907
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
as you go through each of these and so

908
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,760
these it's meant to measure a team

909
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,480
not just a tool but overall i do want to

910
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,200
highlight

911
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,600
communication as sort of i mentioned

912
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,240
before

913
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
and george mentioned before that

914
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
communication is sort of optional

915
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
between teams it can happen the red team

916
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,600
the blue team

917
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
cti can get together everyone can talk

918
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,799
for a purple team exercise

919
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,120
but overall when it comes to a purple

920
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
maturity model

921
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,080
this is a team communication is key they

922
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
are one team

923
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
they are all going to do this together

924
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
so communication isn't optional anymore

925
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
this is something that is ingrained this

926
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,919
is built

927
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,720
and it's uh you know felt that it needed

928
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
to be explicitly said and covered in a

929
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,279
slide because

930
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
it is so critical to the success of this

931
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,360
team

932
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
so with that we have this three levels

933
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,440
uh of maturity for both thread under

934
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,159
understanding

935
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,720
and detection understanding and from

936
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,360
here

937
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
we can sort of uh chart them against

938
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
each other

939
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,159
and build them into this nice square

940
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,600
to represent the three levels of

941
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,440
maturity for both threat understanding

942
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
and detection understanding

943
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,039
because as we mentioned before part of

944
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,919
this is not just

945
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,240
introducing here are these maturity

946
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
levels where are you

947
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,159
but how do you chart the maturity of a

948
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,679
dedicated purple team

949
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,360
as you're building it and measure where

950
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
they are in your organization

951
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
and so this is sort of the the key the

952
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,960
key slide of our our maturity model here

953
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,240
because your team every team is going to

954
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,919
start a little different

955
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,720
and so if you have a super high level of

956
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
detection understanding

957
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,480
you may start in the top left and so

958
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,360
this is where

959
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,440
you're going to be needing to build out

960
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,039
additional threat understanding because

961
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,919
there's a chance

962
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,480
a lot of your detection engineers are

963
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
building their detections in a vacuum

964
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,320
they're not being validated by a red

965
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,279
team you know there was a great talk

966
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,440
at the sands purple team conference that

967
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
a quote i'm gonna i'm gonna pull from

968
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,519
uh one of them i don't remember exactly

969
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,559
who it is but

970
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,279
the question was you know that they

971
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,000
asked was how

972
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,360
many red teams are looking at you know

973
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,640
detections and in an organization how

974
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,039
many

975
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
of those meetings are happening and so

976
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,120
that we're trying to drive that here

977
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,320
with this purple team

978
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
model and that's where making sure

979
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
you're going to build your thread

980
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
understanding

981
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
so you know you might be looking at this

982
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,480
you can

983
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
sort of picture yourself picture your

984
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,519
team

985
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,399
and maybe others are are are not able to

986
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,120
as much

987
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,960
so that's why we are going to walk

988
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
through uh our last set

989
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,320
of slides here and as uh building

990
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
out how we are going to walk through a

991
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,320
fictitious

992
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,880
team going through the purple maturity

993
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
model

994
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
and so again this is our sort of final

995
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,679
question that we're answering in our

996
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,000
roadmap is how can we use it

997
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
and we are going to start with it by

998
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,159
introducing

999
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,240
unicorn inc so as george mentioned

1000
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
before unicorns

1001
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,880
are the scythe uh scythe logo and symbol

1002
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,360
as he has great shirt there also you'll

1003
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,200
notice we've got red and blue we've

1004
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
we definitely didn't coordinate this

1005
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,480
morning when we were

1006
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,399
working on building this presentation

1007
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,640
but we're going to walk through each of

1008
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
the roles of our current

1009
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,679
team members and the sort of scenario

1010
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,480
here is that they've

1011
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,840
been thrown together they've been

1012
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,600
designated uh as the new purple team

1013
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,440
and so we're gonna walk through uh what

1014
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
they what they do

1015
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,399
before they join this purple team uh how

1016
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,240
they're going to integrate the purple

1017
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,440
maturity model

1018
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,279
and then what their roles look like and

1019
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,480
how things have shifted

1020
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,080
afterward so first we're gonna meet alex

1021
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,760
alex is our blue team background alex

1022
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
typically builds new detections uh based

1023
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,279
on the latest indicators of compromise

1024
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
from casey who's our cyber threat

1025
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
intelligence

1026
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,239
uh focused person and

1027
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,159
so there's already some collaboration

1028
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
happening which is great and that was

1029
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,280
part of the reason they were chosen for

1030
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
the purple team is that everyone knew

1031
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,839
communication was key and so alex and

1032
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,399
casey

1033
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,119
were uh you know a great set of people

1034
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,839
to have

1035
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,280
already on the purple team we have

1036
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
brooke brooke is our red team background

1037
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
and so brooke keeps up with the latest

1038
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,560
and greatest

1039
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,159
red team tooling amsi bypasses that

1040
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,560
microsoft has recently patched

1041
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,599
and all of the things uh that the red

1042
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
team community shares on twitter and has

1043
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,399
tried to

1044
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,800
sort of uh integrate a couple of tools

1045
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,440
together for

1046
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
greater effect and it's had some some

1047
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,199
really good success on some of their

1048
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,359
internal red teams

1049
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,400
and then our final uh final unicorn here

1050
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,680
is casey

1051
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,079
now casey has a background in cyber

1052
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,520
threat intelligence reads

1053
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
every cti vendor's threat report uh

1054
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,040
sends over the indicators of compromise

1055
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,560
to alex as we mentioned

1056
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,359
earlier and so has a good working

1057
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,079
relationship

1058
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,480
with the blue team and and feels feels

1059
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
like they're doing a pretty good job

1060
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
and so something you'll notice with all

1061
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,400
of our unicorns here is that they are

1062
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,960
all

1063
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,359
they're all doing their job and so

1064
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,599
that's that's not a bad thing but again

1065
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,839
this mentions and sort of ties back to

1066
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,160
what what we talked about before how

1067
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
this is something that i think a lot of

1068
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
companies can probably

1069
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
and people can see themselves in each of

1070
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
these unicorns

1071
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
and they are doing their job but the

1072
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
problem is they're siloed

1073
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,320
and so they're sort of you know we have

1074
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,079
a little bit of break uh breaking down

1075
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
of those silos between casey

1076
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,160
and alex but we can sort of highlight

1077
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,359
what what some strengths of

1078
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,160
collaborating can be here in the future

1079
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,119
and so as i mentioned uh brooke casey

1080
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
and alex have all been designated for

1081
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
the company's new purple team

1082
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,079
so they're looking at this model and

1083
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,560
then

1084
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,760
they're like cool we're purple now where

1085
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,359
are we

1086
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,079
and so i mentioned before uh you know

1087
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,920
just building off the bios that we've

1088
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
built up here

1089
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,119
that while alex and casey have done some

1090
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,800
collaboration they've mostly

1091
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,720
stuck to indicators of compromise and

1092
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,040
deploying those within the environment

1093
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,960
and so that means that their their

1094
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
detection understanding is probably a

1095
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,000
one

1096
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
and then in this case brooke has done

1097
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
some integrations with their testing

1098
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,720
and uh you know combined a couple

1099
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,440
of tools together for for greater effect

1100
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,160
and so

1101
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,079
brooke has probably moved the threat

1102
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
understanding to the integration phase

1103
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,160
and beyond just deploying

1104
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,960
those tools and so they'd probably start

1105
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,440
in the

1106
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
middle bottom and so overall

1107
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
what we want to chart out here is how do

1108
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
we get them to

1109
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
the top right how do we get them to a

1110
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,240
strong purple team

1111
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,480
and so since they do have a little bit

1112
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
of this you know

1113
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
lopsided um skill set the question would

1114
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,280
be

1115
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,079
where do they need to go next and so my

1116
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
argument here with the purple

1117
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,280
maturity model is that you are better

1118
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,000
off

1119
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,119
moving uh if you are have some sort of

1120
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
expertise and you can choose where you

1121
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,680
go next

1122
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,079
would be to try and even it out and

1123
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,200
balance it out

1124
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,440
and so move towards detection

1125
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
understanding

1126
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,800
and so that would mean that this purple

1127
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,640
team would need to

1128
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
build their understanding in detections

1129
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,640
and the process

1130
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
and all the things and would need to

1131
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
chart a path on how to increase that so

1132
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,359
how do they get to integration

1133
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,599
and so with that we're going to dive

1134
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,640
into

1135
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,359
how this new team has sort of built out

1136
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,520
their roles to address some of those

1137
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,240
gaps

1138
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,000
that they've had and so alex

1139
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,720
alex is running new detections by brook

1140
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
to ensure that they work and are not

1141
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,480
easily bypassed so this is again this is

1142
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,760
something that

1143
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,440
alex was already doing before was

1144
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,599
building those indicators of compromise

1145
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
was building detections based on the new

1146
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,880
part is

1147
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,200
is frankly some integration between uh

1148
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,720
this new member of their team

1149
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,280
so passing over detection to see do

1150
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,160
these work

1151
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,240
uh are they easily bypassed

1152
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,320
incorporating new detection from malware

1153
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
that's specifically identified by casey

1154
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,280
our cyber threatening intelligence

1155
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,240
analyst

1156
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
and sort of bringing those in to make

1157
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,599
sure that

1158
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
we can we can detect against malware

1159
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,359
that's targeting our industry

1160
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,000
and then as i mentioned before moving

1161
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,480
from

1162
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,520
deployment to integration requires doing

1163
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,400
some research

1164
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
where can we where do we have these

1165
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,520
integration points

1166
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,359
and where can we do additional analysis

1167
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
to incorporate uh

1168
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,680
you know our to increase our level of

1169
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,119
detection logic

1170
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,800
and so this is where you know each

1171
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
component is not just a

1172
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
necessarily a doer but also trying to

1173
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,760
understand

1174
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
how do we mature this and build this up

1175
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,520
next and alex is going to be one of the

1176
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,359
key people in this because alex came

1177
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,839
from the blue team

1178
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,480
so now brooke this is brook is our red

1179
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
team background uh brooke

1180
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,040
is now going to start building tests to

1181
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
validate those detections

1182
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
so again this is part of that that shift

1183
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,480
towards purple because

1184
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
instead of just building new tests it's

1185
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
making sure that

1186
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,640
all of the detections are working as

1187
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
intended

1188
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
and so again incorporating these

1189
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
techniques and procedures that

1190
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
uh from threats that have been

1191
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,240
identified by our by casey who again

1192
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,880
is our cyber threat intel background and

1193
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,599
so

1194
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,079
this is going to make sure that all of

1195
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,720
the

1196
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,160
uh new malware and and tools that the

1197
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,680
threats that are targeting

1198
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,960
the unicorn industry are going to

1199
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,680
potentially

1200
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,079
be already tested against and we'll see

1201
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,520
if there's detections

1202
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
but that doesn't mean that brooke is

1203
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,320
going to stay off twitter and that's

1204
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,119
okay

1205
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,240
because new techniques from uh twitter

1206
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
can be passed on to alex to either build

1207
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,839
detections for

1208
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,760
or they can be passed on to casey and

1209
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
this is where context is important

1210
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
because casey can say

1211
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
this technique is being used thank you

1212
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
for identifying this now we

1213
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,880
let's let's work on you know building

1214
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,200
out a test case and a detection for it

1215
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,560
or casey can also say this you know

1216
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,880
this is way beyond anything that we need

1217
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,839
right now or

1218
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,040
that is being leveraged by uh by

1219
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,520
threat groups targeting our area let's

1220
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
you know put this on the

1221
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
backlog and so having that sort of that

1222
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
dialogue and that conversation between

1223
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,560
teams is going to be super important

1224
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,160
and although we've already touched on

1225
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,839
casey's new role

1226
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
uh the focus i want to point to here is

1227
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,359
that the

1228
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,839
research is going to be focused within

1229
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,520
the unicorn industry

1230
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,839
and so while casey was reading every

1231
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,880
vendor's cti

1232
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,240
report before and that's really great

1233
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,400
for knowing the entirety of landscape of

1234
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,599
threat actors

1235
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,839
as far as making sure that casey is

1236
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,000
providing the value necessary to both

1237
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
alex and brooke uh it's going to require

1238
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,400
a bit more focused uh research and so

1239
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,240
that's really what this role is

1240
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
is changing too and you'll see that the

1241
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,000
two other bullet points also sort of

1242
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,079
highlight that

1243
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,160
so the shifting rules that we've seen

1244
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
here between alex brooke

1245
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,960
and casey are on how do we make sure

1246
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,560
that we know how to address these things

1247
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,839
as a team

1248
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,000
and as you're doing this you're going to

1249
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,200
be able to

1250
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,319
again chart your understanding and so

1251
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,359
you have a joint goal between all of the

1252
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,400
blended expertise of red teaming blue

1253
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
teaming and cyber threat intelligence

1254
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,000
as you're able to weave through the

1255
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
model and so the story here goes is that

1256
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,760
you know while while the team started

1257
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,599
with a little bit of a lop side

1258
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,960
of of threat understanding they

1259
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,560
charted out a path they had a lot of

1260
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
momentum and so

1261
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,839
uh it took them to the middle they were

1262
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
able to level out their detection

1263
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,880
understanding with their threat

1264
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
understanding at integration

1265
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
and then from there uh they created a

1266
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,880
couple of novel detections

1267
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,960
realized that they didn't quite have the

1268
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,079
research needed

1269
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,160
and threat understanding to test those

1270
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,599
and so that's how they

1271
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,079
kept working their way to creating their

1272
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,880
own

1273
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,680
novel uh threats and detections for

1274
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,319
those

1275
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,040
and they ended up with a very strong

1276
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
purple team

1277
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
and so that's sort of the story of the

1278
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,599
purple maturity model

1279
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,079
is that it's taking the expertise we

1280
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,280
already have

1281
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
because expertise is something if you

1282
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
look at the the top people that

1283
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,280
are in each of these fields red team

1284
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
blue team cyber threat intel

1285
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,800
we have a huge amount of expertise i

1286
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,760
mean these people

1287
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,960
are are wizards right and geniuses when

1288
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,920
it comes to

1289
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,599
building these things out building up

1290
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,359
detections building out

1291
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,680
bypasses to it and and some of the tools

1292
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,040
that have come out have just been

1293
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,160
amazing

1294
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,119
but how do we take all of that and bring

1295
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,720
it together and purple teaming

1296
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,440
i think is that vehicle it's sort of and

1297
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
that's where

1298
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,200
we are trying to showcase how that can

1299
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
be used

1300
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,720
to move everyone forward in the industry

1301
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,760
and so with that we have answered our

1302
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,520
three main questions

1303
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,400
why does purple need a maturity model uh

1304
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
you know what is that maturity model and

1305
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
then how can we use it

1306
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,079
and so with that any questions

1307
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,480
and thank you all for attending hand it

1308
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,599
back to you george

1309
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,520
yeah thank you red team village thank

1310
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
you red team village organizers and of

1311
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,000
course

1312
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,079
all the attendees and sponsors and all

1313
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,400
that really appreciate the invite

1314
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
and we will take questions on discord

1315
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,160
and

1316
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,680
hopefully you have some good feedback

1317
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,000
for us again this is all what we're

1318
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
seeing out there

1319
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
and hopefully we come back next year and

1320
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,240
let you know what what else is happening

1321
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
and of course uh call to action for you

1322
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,560
to contribute as well how are you

1323
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
implementing purple teaming in your

1324
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,640
organization are you doing

1325
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,200
purple team exercises you have dedicated

1326
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,319
purple teamers right

1327
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,560
keep sharing information because the

1328
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,400
malicious actors are doing it

1329
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,880
and we should too so uh thank you again

1330
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
to the red team village for all the

1331
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
contributions to community

1332
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,960
and uh thanks tim for uh collaborating

1333
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,560
with me and allowing me to come

1334
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,200
uh speak a little bit uh on this on one

1335
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,800
of our favorite topics

1336
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,880
so thank you again
