security advocate at super innovation

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,719
right supernova it's a brazilian company

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,239
uh responsible to provide

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,840
many different services with uh you know

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
developer services actually we have a i

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,080
think 80 or 90 percent

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,799
with developers inside our company amy

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,320
are responsible to talk about

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,760
our open source projects right

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,799
mainly the talk about the or rusek is

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,840
assassed

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
the analysis uh statistical analysis uh

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
search code open source by the way it's

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,520
very very interesting right

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
so i am advocate from this awesome

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
project hacks is not a crime

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
and you know this project is responsible

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,640
to

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
spread this kind of information to the

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
communities

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,119
how much is important to talk about the

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,320
hacking this kind of

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,840
culture any concept and uh because

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
hacking it's really really

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
it's not a crime right it's a mindset

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,439
it's a

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,119
um lifestyle right when you see

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
something and your mind it's a creative

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
right so i am a part of the staff team

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
of the deafcom group this is uh 5511

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
right here in sao paulo i'm talking from

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
brazil now by the way

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,239
and i'm security research and instructor

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:08,959
from

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,360
uh hacker security and i'm responsible

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
to some courses there

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
and by the way it's talking about the

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
bar analysis and i'm a writing reviewer

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
for these

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
magazines there's also magazines and i

uh from fantastic magazines awesome

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,080
courses right so

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
let me talk about our summary or agenda

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
right so today we're gonna talk about it

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
what is trap brainstorming

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
what is thready hunting about the python

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
code purples about this kind of tests

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
that i

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
i made in my environment right so

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
i will explain something about i will

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
show you

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
the demo and in the end of this

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,239
presentation i'm hoping to talk

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
about some questions right so first of

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,599
all

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
it's important to explain some you know

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
some concepts about what is thread

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
uh it's very important because i would

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
like to put all those people with the

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
same page right

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,800
so it's not my definition it's according

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
this iso

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
right so 27 0005

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,879
but it's defined as a potential cause

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
of the incident right so this is the

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
simple definition

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,239
that may cause arms to system an

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
organization it means

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
suffer attacks or maybe death

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
uh of intellectual property or identity

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,360
death

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
right so not some sabotage or

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
you know all information distortion uh

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
are examples of the information

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
security threats it means if you see

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
all those although all these things is

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,319
related

100
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
to ascend software maybe it's compiled

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,480
or not

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
right or some apps it's related to that

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,680
thread

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
right so at some potential cost it's a

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
simple definition about the threat right

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,400
so all these results uh actually

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,319
as a result most of these organizations

108
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
choose active

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
ready hunting practice it means the

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
organization need to see

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
more deeply about this kind of threat

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,720
it's known

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,519
no and you know to try improve the

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,358
defenses mechanism right so

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
i would like to bring you some

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
brainstorm it's important to build

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
this kind of knowledgement right so uh

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
when you need to

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
build some um research chain we need to

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,960
improve this

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
we need to create something related to

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
our working with the research

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
of these threads we need to discovering

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,040
new kind of

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
attacks providing the team with the

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
proactive line

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
it's very important it's some key here

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,040
we have a key

129
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,919
proactive line but it's you need to

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
understand more defenses

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
against advanced threats and it means

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
apt is the later ept is what is apt is

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,560
advanced persistent threat right another

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
point is you need to use

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,039
this kind of offensive techniques

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,720
you need to understand more about the

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,039
vulnerability research because

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
you know you need to search some things

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
about the vulnerabilities related these

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
threads are related to this

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
softwares you need to develop it off

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
exploit it's very important because

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,919
of course we need to in your team need

144
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
to have this kind of

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,639
knowledgement about the programming

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,360
language

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
right you need to have one guy

148
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
or a lady who is responsible to make a

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
reversal engineering

150
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
or to see more deeply to intrusion

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
detections

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
and we have uh

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
you you need to have actually inside of

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
your home some people

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,479
with uh with carved off knowledge

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,919
related to a forensic

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
analysis of course when you talk about

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
differences it's after

159
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
the incident you know but if you have

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
this kind of knowledge when you can

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,479
improve

162
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,039
your soft your development softwares

163
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,520
your

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
skills the development software your

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
defensive

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,319
mechanisms right so the challenge here

167
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:08,960
is

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,520
uh to the the delivery automated

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
intelligence

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
the company to gain productive right so

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
in the end of the day i think this is

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
the very important right

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
and here i create this

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
kind of life not life but this kind of

175
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,479
cycle right so because in the beginning

176
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,440
we have a thread

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
after that you need to understand about

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
the known threads

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
and about the unknown threats this is

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,039
very important why i need to know about

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,960
the known threads felipe

182
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,240
because it's very important to

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
understand about the behavior

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
because you improve your knowledgement

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
and you have this kind of

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
acknowledgement

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
of course you can improve you can have

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,199
this creative mind and i mentioned the

189
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
beginning of these conversations right

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
you can after that using your curiosity

191
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
and and to try and find uh some

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
unknown threads right and of course

193
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
after that you can improve

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
you can generate a report you can

195
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,880
improve your death defenses mechanism

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
you can create um you know a sabbath

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
right intelligence in your environment

198
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,880
and you can

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
uh it's training the cyber resiliency in

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
your environment it's a simple

201
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,800
life cycle that i create so what is

202
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
threading hunting it's a simple

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
definition again

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
it's a proactive approach to defense to

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
the cyber defense

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
with here is the key offensive mind

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
it means the process proactively and

208
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
interactively

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,039
searching you know through the network

210
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,599
to the tech

211
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
and isolate it you have here we have two

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,120
keys detection and isolation

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
right so to detect and isolate

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
advanced threats this is the key because

215
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,759
i always uh mention in my talks

216
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,039
i can work with uh you know

217
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,960
more analysis or you know uh

218
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,879
sock team or in support teams but i

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
i could have in my mind this kind of

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,759
you know uh knowledge this is my invite

221
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,319
to you

222
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,520
you know to bring uh in your mind

223
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
different uh thoughts about the thread

224
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
right so more you know in the top of

225
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,879
tower

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
it's my idea here so who is trading

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,479
hunter not who is or

228
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
what he is or maybe who is or

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
you know who is a freddie hunter it's a

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
professional right

231
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
qualified security guy or you know

232
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,120
professional to

233
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
recognize this the first and after that

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,479
two is a lady

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
and after that to disable a potential

236
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
apt

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
in your environment using of course in

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
manually techniques

239
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
or maybe um artificial intelligence or

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
another different

241
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,399
tools to see and to improve right so

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,880
these

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
people or the people actually these

244
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,320
peoples

245
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
uh can search for a possible internal

246
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,320
and or

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
external intruders here we have another

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
interesting key internals

249
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
because usually we have in the past

250
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
the people uh look at look at so the

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,399
external intruders but now we have an

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
internal intruder that's

253
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,870
a key important key here right so

254
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,000
[Music]

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
okay philippe first you explain

256
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
about that hunting about the research

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
up you bring us uh

258
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
some thoughts about the

259
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,839
uh you know new vision not a new vision

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,279
actually so just my mind

261
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
my thoughts about that and

262
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
about this actually and after that i

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
started to create some python scripts

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
i have of course some guys to work with

265
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
together with me

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,080
to create together these uh

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
tests and um the purple off does this

268
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
test this is

269
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
very simple the idea is this test it was

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
because i i already executed uh i

271
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
perform it actually

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
um to run by iron script to perform

273
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279
a various efficient and detection tests

274
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,000
in various endpoint solutions that's my

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,519
idea do you remember

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
mindset defensive mindset not defensive

277
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,680
mindset actually

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,440
defensive um activities

279
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
with um offensive mindset that here is

280
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,360
the key

281
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
right so during our demonstrations we

282
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,640
and not

283
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
we but i i will show a defensive

284
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
security analysis with that offensive

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,920
mindset

286
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
right as i put in two pylon script

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,040
responsible for downloading some hours

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,079
in our environment in my lab

289
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,200
environment right so he i executed

290
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,399
two simple tests first test is the first

291
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,360
objective

292
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,839
objective will be to simulate

293
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
a target attacks using a pipeline script

294
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
two obtain a panoramic view of the

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
resilience presented its means

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,720
the idea here here is to

297
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,399
execute some downloads of in my

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
controller environment to detect what

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
is what or not what but how much is

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
efficient the engine engines responsible

301
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
to signatures in the endpoint securities

302
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
and next generation antivirus and

303
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,959
machine learning is

304
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,880
running these scripts the idea is to

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
download these artifacts directly

306
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
in my whitman machine and execute this

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
kind of

308
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
tasks and my idea it was to see

309
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,240
the behavior of the signatures engines

310
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
and next generation antivirus engines

311
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,279
and

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
machine learning right so this is the

313
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
first purpose the second purpose is to

314
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
run more

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,279
than one python script with the daily

316
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,079
malwares

317
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
because um of course are using this

318
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
modern bazaar

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,519
repository um we have inside of this

320
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,079
repository

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,480
it's very interesting repository with

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,279
it's available to open requests by api

323
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
right so if you try to execute this kind

324
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,600
of test you can download more than 2

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
000 real mowers in your environment per

326
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
day sometimes you have

327
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,800
i don't know 1 000 hours you know

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,639
update not updated but um

329
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,079
you know i can't up uh i can upload my

330
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,240
malware inside of this repository so you

331
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
sometimes you have more than 1000 hours

332
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,440
per day

333
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
inside of this repository so you'd like

334
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,560
to test

335
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
you are you would like to prove your

336
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,600
security point

337
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
it's totally possible right so here this

338
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,040
is the first code

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
python code right so the first first of

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,720
all

341
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
as you can see here in my code i just

342
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
imported this

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
in the library right the request and

344
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
systems and some arguments

345
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,000
and the zone and pi zipper because the

346
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
idea here is to download

347
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,839
a malware and of course when you

348
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,240
download some hours from some repository

349
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,800
usually this mowers or this sample or

350
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,279
this

351
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,800
file comes to the your environment

352
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,160
in uh z pad right so you need to

353
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
uncompress this file right

354
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,040
so this is the first idea here so i'll

355
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,360
be

356
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600
using the the sha 20156

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
hash to download in my environment as

358
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,120
you can see here so this is a simple

359
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,680
program

360
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
you know the dollar and more simple from

361
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,720
our bazaar

362
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
by abuse doc x8 or ch

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
this is the website right so here's some

364
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,320
parameters that i can

365
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,920
set or like uh it's a similar flags in

366
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
using a cli right so first of all i need

367
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
to

368
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
run the not run i need to

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
write the the hash as you can see here

370
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
and after that i can unzip this file

371
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
and download my uh mower inside my

372
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
environment right so it's very

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
very simple code too again

374
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
i can set the hash i can set this

375
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
flag right so the then

376
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
that's s and i need to write the

377
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
i need to fill the the hash and after

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,160
that i need to set dash

379
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,279
u to unzip you have to unzip the old

380
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
fire of course i need to set the

381
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,680
password

382
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
to downloading my environments right so

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,160
here this is the first step that i can

384
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,320
that i can show you you know using the

385
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,279
cyber reason

386
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
solution first of all it's very

387
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
important to explain to the

388
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,959
to the to you and everyone my idea here

389
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,160
it's not to prove you what is the best

390
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
secured endpoint solution right not my

391
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,079
idea here

392
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,440
the idea is to bring you this offense

393
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,839
this

394
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,120
security testing with us

395
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
offensive mind right this is this

396
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,360
the purple of this presentation and this

397
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,399
idea right

398
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,959
not what is the best solutions take a

399
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
look it's very important to explain

400
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,320
and to be clear for everyone right so as

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
you can see here i set the python i

402
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
did the binary to execute the binary

403
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
script in my environment

404
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,079
and after that i called the script that

405
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,519
i show you

406
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
and i set dash s because i need to set

407
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,560
the

408
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,199
hash responsible to download this

409
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,639
information

410
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,079
and after that i set this u

411
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,000
because the sample needs to be unzipped

412
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
right in my environment as you can see

413
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,680
here this is

414
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
uh let me return here and uh

415
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,880
yes i need to use the request of course

416
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,000
to request

417
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,279
uh the access in my uh

418
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
environment right in my in our bazaar

419
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,800
website

420
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
right so just to be clear and here the

421
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,160
first test

422
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,040
in uh using the cyber reason platform

423
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,600
right

424
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
so i download this hash

425
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
as you can see here in the beginning of

426
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
the hash of course it's

427
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
very bigger but it's that e e and d as

428
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
you can see here in our bazaar it's a

429
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,839
wannacry

430
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
it's very known hour attempt server by

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,959
the way

432
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
and i download this model in my

433
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
environment as you can see here

434
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
and i execute this uh uncompressed file

435
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,800
here

436
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
and after that take a look what happened

437
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,920
the

438
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
file is a block it's very interesting

439
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,279
because

440
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,160
i don't need to execute themselves in my

441
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,959
environment just

442
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
to unzip the file inside my in my

443
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,079
environment

444
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
and after that the engine do you

445
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
remember the test the engine responsible

446
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,560
to

447
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
to signatures detected this

448
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,800
malware right so as you can see in the

449
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,600
log

450
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
the mower it was blocked in the tech

451
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,440
it's very cool and the second let me

452
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
check here yes this is the second test

453
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,400
that i did

454
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
but in the sofa solutions it's another

455
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,679
security

456
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
endpoint solutions the same thing here i

457
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,199
just

458
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
changed the mower right by using another

459
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
hash as you can see here

460
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
by the way i like to use menu ram

461
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,520
servers because it's it's very

462
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,400
dangerous right and uh here it's another

463
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,359
i think it's a

464
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,439
patch or no patch if i remember

465
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,640
correctly but

466
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
you know i download here as you can see

467
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
and after that take a look this the

468
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,679
engine responsible to detect

469
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
the no mower it works very cool very

470
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,919
well

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,120
and it was blocked right so

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,720
let's see here another the second coat

473
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
iron code using a different in a

474
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
different way

475
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
here um as you can see here it's

476
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
different because if you remember in the

477
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
beginning the explanation when i

478
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
talked to you about the second code or

479
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,799
the second objective

480
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,080
the idea is to download a daily

481
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
breath black branch mowers right it

482
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,760
means

483
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,799
every day the marbles i receive many

484
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
mowers from the community

485
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,600
and in the end of the days the marbles

486
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
are generate

487
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
mower branch uh mowers and you can

488
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,640
download

489
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,760
all those mowers inside your environment

490
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,559
to

491
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
test themselves right so here you can

492
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
write your api provide power bazaar and

493
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
of course

494
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
in here you you using the request

495
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
python code and you can

496
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
unzip your file uh your

497
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
actually it's not a second it's a uh the

498
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,559
continue

499
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
sorry it's a continue of this code as

500
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
you can see here to any

501
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
uh for a line and after that let me show

502
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,600
you

503
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,960
is 24 6 because i i edit this code just

504
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,760
to show

505
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,559
this is the request using the the import

506
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,520
request

507
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
library right so this is the the api

508
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,480
uh url to using in our test right

509
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,760
so and uh here i

510
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
execute in my environment but using

511
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,320
or to try explain explore

512
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
more um about the cloud strike

513
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
testing right so here as you can see um

514
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
are using execute the same test but in

515
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,640
this case is

516
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,200
something different happens uh

517
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
as you can see i i edit my

518
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,039
actually my code and using another name

519
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799
here in the zoo security labs

520
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
and i download the sample here the

521
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
hashing and i

522
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
uh um using the downloading and i n

523
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
package of its main site and compress

524
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
this file here

525
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
as you can see but how to strike works a

526
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
different way

527
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
because crowdstrike just works with

528
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,280
a real-time execution it means

529
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
i need to execute the mower inside my

530
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,600
environment and after that

531
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
they will as will execute their uh

532
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,720
engines in your environment they don't

533
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,559
have any uh

534
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,640
in that maybe on at that time they

535
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,919
didn't have

536
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
the signatures english right so maybe

537
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,520
now

538
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
when i'm talking in this presentation

539
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
maybe they

540
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
are improved this but when i did this

541
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,679
test

542
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
and as you can see here in october 2020

543
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,799
they didn't right so that's here

544
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,120
very important so here the second codes

545
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,320
are for that

546
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
so here the as you can see here from

547
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,679
daytime

548
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
import data and time delta right this is

549
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
the just import some

550
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
uh functions from this library right and

551
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,200
here i

552
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,720
i import another libraries

553
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,080
from this uh this

554
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
another things and uh

555
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
let's see here are using the same

556
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,679
subsequent labs the supremes

557
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,799
you know that to be cool

558
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,240
and using the the password to

559
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
unzip the file right and here the key

560
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,200
right so i can set the data to download

561
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
it means i can set the specifically date

562
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
you can set here the specifically day

563
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
that i would like to download in my

564
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
environment for example

565
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
if you would like to uh try download

566
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
another day that already passed for

567
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,080
example

568
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,120
uh for you know my day

569
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,480
and not at the the main day i can

570
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
write here your right that the the

571
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,679
correctly

572
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
start uh time as you can see here right

573
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,919
but if i don't set this information that

574
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,559
they

575
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
responsible to be downloaded in the last

576
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,600
day

577
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,480
that i receive many uh you know daily

578
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,960
malware

579
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,159
batches right as you can see here so

580
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,679
again uh i can using the data here

581
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
by the way it's in the not um

582
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
the python script it's in python 3

583
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
actually but we have another

584
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
different uh strings that i can that i

585
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,880
used here

586
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,679
and i will download using the api as you

587
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,720
can see here

588
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,280
take a look this here is the date

589
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
specifically day

590
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
right and i set the name in the power

591
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
from our batches

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
and i will request

593
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,559
using the um our bazaar dash

594
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,600
uh download as you can see here and here

595
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,880
is the date

596
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,840
the date file right so as you compare if

597
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,720
you compare this

598
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,280
both of them it's different because here

599
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,080
i

600
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
request the api right uh

601
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,240
that should be one but i set the hash to

602
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
remember let me return here i need to

603
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,760
set the

604
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,159
corrective hash right so this is the

605
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,679
important thing here's

606
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,440
so checks on the rash right so i need to

607
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,520
um feel the rash and here in the second

608
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
i using the diff in different ways i

609
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,440
need to set the day

610
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
or if i don't start the day it's a full

611
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
day right so here

612
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
i will um download the

613
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
zip in my environment i will complete

614
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,760
download it

615
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,120
and i will uh you know uncompress

616
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,080
and as you can see here daily mower bags

617
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,880
unpackaged

618
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,799
it means all those bowers it will be

619
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,000
what will be in my environment

620
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
right so here it's very important thing

621
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,760
to explain

622
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
so let's suppose we have uh you remember

623
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
more than 200

624
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,919
mowers in your environment it's like

625
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,880
outbreak

626
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,919
attack right so you can imagine if you

627
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,400
receive something like a similar dos

628
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,279
from the mowers

629
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,080
it's you know just uh let's suppose

630
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,880
again

631
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,919
okay so i as i put this in this cyber

632
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
reason environment as you can see here

633
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,919
so uh this is the second testing using a

634
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,720
a python script here and the name it's a

635
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,440
mower

636
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,679
dash power in the score sorry

637
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
uh download duckpin right so download

638
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,120
using the data as you can see here it's

639
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
uh

640
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,520
september 10th downloaded using this

641
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
as you can see here that the folder is

642
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
different right it's not

643
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
api verse 1 right of v1 it's different

644
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,000
it's a mb the the api

645
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
dot abuse dot h oops sorry and uh

646
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
bash downloads and here is the date and

647
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,320
after that

648
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
the download is completed and saving

649
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,480
that

650
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
that data sets complete and data sets

651
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
because we have a mini all the mowers

652
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,120
here's

653
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
unpacked as you can see here in this

654
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
folder and

655
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
take a look at this what is the behavior

656
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
and of course because

657
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,159
you if you receive some multi-break

658
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,320
attack of course you have a

659
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,520
high cpu high memory in your environment

660
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,400
because you have many samples here's

661
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
new uh you know uh informations in your

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
hard drive

663
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
and of course the engine needs to work

664
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,400
so

665
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,760
i have good results here not so good but

666
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,320
just

667
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,279
a good because the the server doesn't

668
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
work with um

669
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
but it's in my tests some reason it was

670
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,679
the best

671
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,760
right and after that as you can see here

672
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
i executed the same testing power

673
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
uh bazaar uh underscore

674
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
um daily and as you can see here it's

675
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,840
another day

676
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
because here is 28th september it's

677
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
different this day

678
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
as you can see 18 days afters and take a

679
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
look at this

680
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,360
the performer or the performance of this

681
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,840
the cpu it was different because we have

682
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
many engines as you can see here's for

683
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
my opinion it's a flippy period's

684
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,159
opinion

685
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
it's more difficult because we haven't

686
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
many engines works

687
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,080
as you can see here in this parade and

688
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,039
uh

689
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,360
in the results it's not so good in this

690
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
in that time right

691
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
and i of course all those tests guys i

692
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
reported to the all those vendors and i

693
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
tried this right

694
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,440
and the soulfuls and in some reason i

695
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,919
had

696
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,720
very good talks with the cyber reason i

697
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,120
talked with a cso from cyber reasons and

698
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
the team from server is very very cool

699
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
i talk i have some talks with us a sofas

700
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,840
and crowdstrike

701
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,480
not so good but anyway it's a simple

702
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,360
test and

703
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,320
my idea is to try and prove the security

704
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
sensors right

705
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,120
so here some exploited alert then i will

706
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
finish my presentations

707
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
because here i'm using another python

708
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
called it's a 30

709
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
30 python code as you can see here

710
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,520
i import the the os socket and sub

711
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
process

712
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
and threading so maybe if you are

713
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
offensive guy you can suppose what this

714
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,640
means in this case

715
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
so as you can see here i set the socket

716
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,000
using an avia

717
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,640
af8 it's means my idea here

718
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,240
is to try gain the access in my

719
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,720
victim machine as you can see here so

720
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,399
uh as you can see here i set this kind

721
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,600
of process in

722
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
windows system 32

723
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
to call the cmd right it's a spoiler

724
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,520
why is i spoiler felipe because i

725
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,159
haven't

726
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,200
talked to explain all those

727
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
attacks it's just a spoiler right so

728
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
here this uh

729
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,520
test that i did i just show you up some

730
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
informations to you

731
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,360
this test is to us realizing a counter

732
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
strike as you can see here

733
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,120
so i will pass the idea here this is the

734
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,720
ip from this machine the solution

735
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
worked here in this case it's called the

736
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
strike as you can see

737
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,720
the system information this is in from

738
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,640
system information about this

739
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
solution and let me pass more here

740
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,440
you can see the all those informations

741
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
that you have here

742
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,600
you have some powershell scriptes and

743
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
python shell.python here

744
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
as you can see this is the file

745
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,600
that i will using in my

746
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
next presentation this is just a

747
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,320
fail fill a spoiler alert

748
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
right so i set the configurations here i

749
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,760
will pass more

750
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,799
all those configurations about the

751
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,919
best practices it was

752
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,760
enabled in aggressive mode by the way so

753
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
should be detect my simple

754
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,880
simple python shell reverse

755
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,559
code right and let me uh

756
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,279
show you here as you can see all those

757
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,640
process and uh it was

758
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
enabled in my machine and

759
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,120
after that take a look where i did in my

760
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
demonstrations here

761
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,200
and i just opened my

762
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,159
you know using a netcat here using that

763
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:24,840
port

764
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,960
77 right and i oh this is my

765
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,000
attacking machine and i will execute a

766
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,960
simple

767
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,559
attack here i will call

768
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,880
this python shell and what

769
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,559
happened in my vichman machine here

770
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,960
maybe nothing happened here's because we

771
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
didn't

772
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,919
see any blockade but wow

773
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,520
we have shell

774
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,799
in my victim machine as you can see here

775
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,760
this is a good spoiler alert because we

776
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,880
have another

777
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
talk to explain more details about that

778
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
take a look at this we have the control

779
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
of the our victim machine and let's see

780
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
here

781
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,640
how you have you went to the

782
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,480
desktop and after that i created this

783
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,919
simple simple file right so

784
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,760
echo you lose very very creative

785
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,960
as you can see here right so

786
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
because the victim

787
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,279
okay so type the the file that i'm

788
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
creating here

789
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,360
because i'm manipulating you because i

790
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
have a shell here

791
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,520
i have a shell i have a control of my

792
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,039
victim machine here

793
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
it's here because before

794
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,000
didn't have here and as you can see here

795
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,480
the file it's here and after that

796
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
oh after that finish my presentation

797
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,640
because it's just

798
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
only a field spoiler right so

799
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,880
guys and uh again thank you so

800
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
