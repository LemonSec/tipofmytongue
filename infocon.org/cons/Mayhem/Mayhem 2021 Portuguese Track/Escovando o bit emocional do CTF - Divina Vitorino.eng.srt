9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,450


10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,539
Previous members drink water don't have any

Well first of all our schedule, right

13
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,530
about what

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,010
we're going to talk about today we're going to talk about STF we're going to

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,079
talk about scientific research and I

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,109
'll also share with you

17
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:52,129
How was mine  creation process and the

18
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,379
results I got with thermal blinds

19
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,550


20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,340
Hello first, I'll introduce myself

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,370
my name is Divina Vitorino I'm an

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,129
information security specialist I

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,600
have 13 years of experience in

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
technology.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,880


26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,430
information graduated in

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,020
computer networks by the Faculty

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,470
Impacta de Tecnologia I am a specialist

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,659
in computing.  not applied to education by

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,360
USP São Carlos they like events a little

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,180
I miss the in-

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,800
person events and there's a

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,070
kitten but first, right What is

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,280
capture the flag? I'll start with a

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,480
little history the first

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,510
Deco dctf that the  oldest hacker conference

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,800
in the world created by Jeff Moss in

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,050
1993 the first CTF happened in 1996 the

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,210
counting of points was done

40
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,300
manually with judges and there were only four

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,080
teams competing talking a little at the

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,639
level Brazil we have h2hc in 2004 and

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,060
we had the  h2hc's first CPF this

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,190
competition was open to the

45
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,130
general public that was present at the event or

46
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,650
not through a connection to the server

47
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,740
that hosted these challenges

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,180
and in 2011 we had apses apses

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,330
it has a CPF with 24 hours

50
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,400
duration and 2014 we had  crypto rave

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,360
and rice is I believe rave has a CPF that is

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,750
also 24 hours long and it

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,600
may have Raquel Freire

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,170
and in 2020 we were there for a new

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,420
event which is the HC o ul  hacking timate that

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,700
happens weekly is broadcast on

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,170
Twitch

58
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,520
and when we talk about CPF I found

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,040
it easier to make this division to be

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,770
a little simpler to understand

61
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,489
basically how it works so you

62
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,880
have two game possibilities

63
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,090
you can play individually or in

64
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,030
group depends on the CPF rule you

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,330
are participating How the game you

66
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,739
can play the CPF online or in person

67
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,410
now basically we have the CPF online

68
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,569
because of the pandemic what is the

69
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,880
style is not what styles of play it's

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,610
all about  Same thing no you have a gel

71
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,519
Stop that are challenges different

72
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,370
categories for you to solve then you

73
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,440
can be

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,980
programming network encryption forensic webb challenges But

75
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,860
you can also be the attack defense and

76
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,180
in the attack defense you have 2

77
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,140
Hi and the team must  attack the opponent and

78
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,829
also defend your territory So

79
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,370
you have machines you have machines with

80
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,500
vulnerabilities to be exploited And

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,659
you also have to pro  protect the

82
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,630
vulnerabilities of your machines and

83
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,630
you have the mixer of a mix of happens

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,690
when you have both forms both gel

85
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,000
for and when the attack defense.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,570


87
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,210


88
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,270
they must attack a

89
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,849
specific machine and gain control,

90
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,690
right. From the moment

91
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,270
that this team has gained

92
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,759
control of itself, the machine will have

93
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,060
to defend there if another attacker

94
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,759
gains control, this is the function of this new

95
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,729
team to protect this machine and so

96
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,160
on is an attitude of curiosity

97
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,360
and the hackaflag of 2018 download 7 it was

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,170
in this format

99
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,919
I'm talking a little bit now about

100
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,469
scientific research in what the hell is

101
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,839
this how I made it feel whenever

102
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,939
we talk about research a  we think

103
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,449
about something kind of like Dexter's Laboratory

104
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,369
is no longer the truth is that this is

105
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:32,430
a very romantic view, right, the

106
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,490
research. It is much more simplistic than

107
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,639
that

108
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,259
and it is  simple right but not that simple

109
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,960
basically when you are doing

110
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,909
research you have a kind of

111
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,569
protocol to be followed It depends a lot on the

112
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,419
area you are researching but in a

113
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,139
more macro view you basically need to go

114
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,180
through all these steps of

115
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,449
choosing the topic to study  what is already known

116
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,520
about this topic is the

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,159
literature review the definition of the problem

118
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,889
justification of why you are

119
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,650
studying that problem a

120
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,800
study planning if you are going to do

121
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,139
a case study a single

122
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,680
or double experiment how are you going to collect this

123
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,729
data a  it collects analysis of the

124
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,050
results and finally the presentation

125
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,259
where you give an overview of what

126
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,650
happened

127
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,509
is really this presentation I'm

128
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,160
doing here for you is more or less

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,740
a step by step of how I did

130
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,350
my research and  this whole cycle of the

131
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,270
story of what happened the research it is

132
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,699
an investigation and the investigations you

133
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,770
can do in the three great areas of

134
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,560
exact knowledge  human and biological

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,030
and now that we've talked a little

136
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,389
about STF we've also talked a little

137
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,280
about research, I'll tell you

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,639
about the project effectively.

139
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,849


140
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,180


141
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,939
I

142
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,330
started planning how

143
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,180
it was going to be, so I had four

144
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,270
big steps, right, building the

145
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,909
challenge itself, so to help me in

146
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,879
this part, I invited some

147
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,069
people to make a challenge for

148
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,789
this CPF, the player profile, which is a

149
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,000
questionnaire  in Portuguese

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,529
psychometrically validated on the beach this end and I

151
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,719
have the flow study part that the

152
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,879
black exposure part of the flow and

153
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,219
also experience but what is

154
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,379
this state of flow takes the state of

155
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,750
flow it is a mental state one day

156
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,370
person she is completely medical in

157
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,040
that activity she is doing

158
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,440
and psychologically speaking which

159
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,900
means that the person's brain

160
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,570
is completely focused  in that

161
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,430
activity and starts to disregard

162
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,290
everything around, so if the person is

163
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,730
hungry, thirsty, if the night

164
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,690
brain starts to

165
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,010
totally discard these issues, right?

166
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,470


167
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,570


168
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,289
they're composing or when

169
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,460
they're doing their

170
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,800
work and

171
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,050
oh but it's not all flowers because

172
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,430
of covid-19 i had to change my

173
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,579
project

174
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,420
and with cancellation of

175
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,739
face-to-face events i had to readjust

176
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,860
my research so i could  do

177
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,339
it online so after crying

178
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,110
my head out, I run screaming around, I

179
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,369
along with my colleagues who helped me on

180
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,129
this project, we arrived at

181
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,910
a format And we ended up managing to

182
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,429
operationalize it so before

183
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:34,009
correcting my plan was to do

184
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,610
an engagement analysis between sells  face-to-face and

185
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,350
online and after that, with the arrival of

186
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,569
correcting everything else, it was only

187
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,239
possible to collect in online events I

188
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,850
have di  I saw this event online in two

189
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,959
and I did the collection in both events and

190
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,819
that's how it came to be right

191
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,060
and that's how Star CT as Slim also came

192
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,899
with me Guilherme and Carlos me, oh

193
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,690
good so basically the design

194
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,910
we call the design of the experiment it

195
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,820
it ended up changing so We created two

196
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,519
scenarios the first scenario we

197
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,000
call or through work was a scenario

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,040
where the challenges can be

199
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,589
solved independently is the gel

200
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,260
can be conventional It is the

201
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,000
conventional geopark model CTF that we are

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,410
used to and for the scenario  B which we

203
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,019
called DmC which means

204
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,589
mechanical dynamics and components is also a

205
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,720
geocore with the same challenges as the

206
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,709
scenario a with new game dynamics and

207
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,790
with the same participants is from the

208
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,300
first

209
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,140
good experiment These were some rules I

210
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,269
had to do for  account of the type of

211
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,180
experiment I was

212
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,250
conducting this is also very

213
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,890
important because according to the type

214
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,040
of experiment case study the report

215
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,100
q  What are you doing? You have between "a

216
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,709
primer that you have to follow for

217
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,220
that experiment to be valid

218
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,959
so a curiosity here this type of

219
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,029
experiment that I conducted is called

220
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,910
paired experiment so whoever

221
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,120
played Open Word mode in the first

222
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,750
event played the mode  from Mc in the second and

223
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,649
vice versa

224
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,879
and it was from that we had the

225
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,660
Brilliant idea to create a story

226
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,970
so in this story We created a

227
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,850
fictional agency that was the company that

228
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,179
smart startec is it we

229
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,610
reorganized the challenges so that they

230
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,279
were coherent with  the story then

231
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,709
was the same challenges of the

232
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,470
conventional CPF of Open Word mode but with

233
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,779
a new guise additional game elements

234
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,689
to be able to fit into this

235
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,259
story

236
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,170
and the x-ray of the competition is what

237
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,140
happened in the end we had a

238
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,500
happy ending we didn't  a happy ending

239
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,100
no one showed up to play don't miss it

240
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,670
on Globo Repórter joke no i

241
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,200
can't be serious all the time ask

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,290
pardon everyone  but what happened

243
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,020
yes people came to play it was a lot of

244
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,630
fun if you are watching

245
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,680
this lecture then you played one or

246
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,440
two editions of Star Chef Thank you very much

247
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,990
for your collaboration the events will

248
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,660
take place in June last year at

249
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,410
first we have 73 participants

250
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,350
of these 73 participants, 46 responded

251
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,910
to the questionnaires that were

252
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,130
available on the platform for data collection.

253
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,340
We had 39 people who

254
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,920
identified with the male gender 7

255
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,760
people who identified with genius

256
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,350
is an average age of 26 years, in the

257
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,530
second event we had 51

258
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,800
participants  36 answered the

259
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,070
questionnaires 33 with an accident were

260
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,920
male 3 with female and

261
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,040
an average age of 25

262
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,720
years daddy forget

263
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,209
that I will also share with you

264
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,660
some very interesting research findings

265
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,699
that I just discovered

266
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,850
not after the collection  and

267
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,879
data processing The first is that we had

268
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,870
too much challenge, right in the competition, so

269
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,449
we  two templates available in both

270
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,569
open word and DMC neither player

271
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,439
managed to solve all the challenges

272
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:18,290
so this led me to the conclusion that the

273
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,110
difficulty level of the challenges

274
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,569
ended up sending a lot of

275
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,389
participant time we have a total of

276
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,880
twenty challenges available

277
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,870
the other point  is that the freedom AND

278
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,480
independence of the game, right, freedom

279
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,060
to be able to solve Tiradentes, it

280
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,790
also had an impact on performance

281
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,150
and engagement.

282
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,980


283
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,010


284
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,940


285
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,880
who played the story mode We

286
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,920
also had some cases the game in

287
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,950
the system what is someone like that is

288
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,010
an attempt to circumvent the rules of the

289
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,640
game according to the literature of

290
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,390
Psychology this ends up happening because

291
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,400
the levels of frustration and

292
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,490
players' anxiety is too high he wants to

293
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,610
solve that challenge but or he does

294
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,830
n't know  enough or he's not

295
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,900
being able to develop a logic

296
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,300
to solve that challenge, so he

297
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,889
ends up going to this type of anti

298
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,239
and, for example, asking for help to see if the

299
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,749
person ends up dropping the answer or

300
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,899
madly submitting

301
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,170
super short intervals to see if he ends up getting it right.

302
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,579
response to that challenge is obtained

303
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,220
are behaviors taken as the

304
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,889
game exist and finally people who

305
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,809
have preferences for

306
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,859
socialization characteristics so for example

307
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,239
people who like to interact during

308
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,309
the game to talk with their opponents

309
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,129
or even with their teammates  If

310
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,949
it's a team competition, for example,

311
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,379
they were They had the

312
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,419
most impaired performance because he doesn't have

313
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,759
this part, let's say, it's watched,

314
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,980
right, so the plant there also had a

315
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,199
limitation of the platform, we did the

316
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,899
qfd to make this Competition, I felt

317
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:32,680
and  it has no elements Or at least

318
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,910
until the date of the CPF and until June of

319
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,339
last year it n  there were no elements that

320
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,920
stimulated this social interaction

321
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,519
between players

322
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,870
and finally, the results until one

323
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,080
of these days led me to I graduated so I

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,480
complete my specialization I received the

325
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,370
title of specialist in computing

326
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,680
applied to education is the article I

327
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,010
wrote for  my TCC which is called

328
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,060
being sitf is that our people

329
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,760
forgot the name of my article Very good

330
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,480
congratulations for me joke the STF EA

331
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,839
next turn to regain Player Type and

332
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,420
fluorides piercings eh an article i

333
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,420
wrote in english it was accepted in one

334
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,910


335
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,760
International Military Cyber Defense Congress and I will present in

336
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,060
August this year and

337
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,830
