1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,240
Hi guys, how are you? I'm in crisis, it

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,360
's part of the Garoa hacker club and also

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,550
several other Communities. Your attention will be

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,680
better in a little while and

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,080
I would like to thank you for

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,199
your presence at this event.

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,390


8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,360
living for the idea for the initiative to

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,150
create this track in Portuguese, right to

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,730
value our audience, right?

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,090
And let's be honest, not everyone in the

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,329
market speaks I understood English well, so it

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,800
's very important that we take the

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,550
initiative to help people  And the

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,850
community here at Verdade is the theme

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,890
of my conversation with you, I wo

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,690
n't even call you a lecture I made some

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,300
slides to have an illustration but I

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,100
would like if it was more of a

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,210
conversation and in the end it was interact a

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,559
little with Felipe, right  we're going to

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,850
exchange some ideas as well to

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,350
complement the ideas that I'm going to.

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,719
And then leave the project here on the

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,290
slides so the idea of this

26
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,000
conversation is for us to talk a little bit  I

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,759
don't think about the communities, right, it doesn't go down, we

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,259
have our market, which is

29
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:14,360
something I think is extremely cool, it

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,380
's very positive and how it helps us a

31
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,450
lot from a career point of view.

32
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,740


33
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,030


34
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,430
to foster our own career

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,600
even for those who are starting in the market

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,549
without a very cool opportunity for

37
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,590
you to enter the market through the

38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,780
Communities and as they are also a

39
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,850
very cool support in this phase of the pandemic, in

40
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,110
this phase that everyone is isolated

41
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,159
concerned, right, going through a

42
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,860
credits situation so i didn't comment on

43
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,409
the moral achievements i've been working in

44
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,630
the security market for more than 20 years

45
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,280
there as you can see by my non-

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,729
white hair right ah i'm one of the

47
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,920
founders of Garoa hacker Club who was the

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,149
first guy, ok  this here in Brazil

49
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,360
that we've

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,250
been wanting for ten years here in São Paulo also

51
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,910
organized together with some friends they

52
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,008
organize a really cool event that bysite

53
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,169
São Paulo, every time he performs here

54
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,330
in São Paulo, we also celebrate 10 years

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,930
of bsides recently,

56
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,480
but unfortunately this year and last year

57
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,340
we didn't hold the event for

58
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,069
him because of the academy and fortunately,

59
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm also part of several other

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
communities in this part  of the pants he

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,090
had there and he's part of Once and I'm going to

62
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,879
comment a little bit about these

63
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,189
communities but halfway to the end

64
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,859
of my presentation Okay so let's go

65
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,970
there,

66
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,490
as I commented,

67
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,020
we can talk a little bit about the

68
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,530
communities  and how they help us to

69
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,870
build our career and how they

70
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,960
also help us survive in this

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,410
pandemic phase and my motivation to

72
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,420
create this one that can be summarized

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,500
in this meme

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,120


75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,890
in off Down in remorse

76
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,850
right along with the rest of the whole world and

77
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,680
then the rest of the whole world gets super

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,990
scared desperate because there's one

79
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,190
here give one because there's  a show

80
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,500
locked up at home can only talk about

81
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,690
computers and we talk like that, guys,

82
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,720
but that's not normal, right, so the

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,610
guys called quarantine for us,

84
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,990
normal life

85
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,980


86
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,890
It's logical to

87
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,900
discredit the whole social problem, everything

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,720
programmed, economic, the

89
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,030
humanitarian crisis that we're going through because

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,080
of that, right, but this is a super very

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,690
interesting kind of old man for

92
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,980
me to stay in the Home Office to stay

93
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,840
working in my pajamas locked at home and

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,960
don't come  no one is normal it's wonderful

95
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,690
right because you're complaining about it right And

96
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,140
this is our life normally right And

97
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,990
then so to open it opaque right then

98
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,360
yeah let's go in the quick

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,310
sincere perspective on our

100
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,720
job market here it's impossible to do

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,180
technology market and  even

102
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,750
safety marker not to mention the great lack in the

103
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,880
great blackout of professionals that

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
exists in the area, there is a very

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,710
very large demand for professionals  sionals by

106
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,970
professional

107
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,730
and specialized security professionals, but even more

108
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,560
worldwide, ok, this is not only in Brazil and if

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,270
I am only in the United States and it is a Global problem,

110
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,660
the people of this want the

111
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,600
same organization responsible for the

112
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,660
famous cissp certification.

113
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,460
right study report on the

114
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,880
work of the job market in the

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,430
security area and then leave one from

116
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,650
last year they also started to map the

117
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,840
lack of it not late.

118
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,490


119
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,350


120
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,230
demand for

121
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,330
3.12 million

122
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,940
security professionals around the world, don't you put it

123
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,490
all together to lack veltter for an open vacancy,

124
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,919
we're looking for professionals, etc.

125
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,470
we would need to train immediately

126
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,380
now like this in the blink of an eye

127
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,980
3.12 million people

128
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,820
And then this demand is not what  means

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,830
in practice this means what do

130
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,650
we have with 0 unemployment rate in

131
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,600
the insurance market  ance in the

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,480
technology market too, right? That is, when

133
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,450
we're talking about the global crisis, the country

134
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,350
is in crisis, it's starting to close, etc.

135
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,270
so it's unemployed. That

136
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,070
's really a serious problem.

137
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,480


138
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,910
skin when you go out on the

139
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,340
street for those who work with technology

140
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,650
for those who work safely in

141
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,020
particular the unemployment rate is zero

142
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,110
you don't get unemployed you are pigs

143
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,370
and sometimes it can take a while for

144
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,890
you to put it in for you to find the job

145
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,380
of your dreams it's not  so it's never

146
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,930
a bed of roses but the fact is we have

147
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,450
a demand for professionals much

148
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,890
greater than the number of

149
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,170
existing professionals and much

150
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,540
greater than the capacity of the general

151
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,320
professional market today.

152
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,990


153
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,450
managers and for the

154
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,160
companies themselves, this is a

155
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,230
very large program which means that

156
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,600
people cannot hire people

157
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,150
to manage their security.

158
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,030
yeah Oh and because of that, companies end up

159
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,520
not being able to protect themselves

160
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,260
properly not that she knew she didn't

161
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,240
do adequate protection right That's

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,660
another matter for another ok right but

163
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,370
anyway That they wanted even if they

164
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,990
were on a budget, even if he

165
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,650
was  really comfortable with the

166
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,470
ability to protect themselves, they didn't

167
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,210
want enough professionals to

168
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,190
do this protection and when we

169
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,950
start looking for specialized professionals, they

170
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,760
're like I want

171
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,900
a pentesters, right, I promised mobile I

172
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,360
want the cloud security architecture guy

173
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,270
when you  you can go

174
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,550
into the specifics, then you really don't think

175
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,490
it's whitefly, ok, so this is a

176
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,530
big challenge for the market but for

177
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,969
us it's an opportunity because if we

178
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,449
stay correctly in the ias, we

179
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,099
don't know how to navigate, so we

180
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,989
can find great opportunities

181
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,999
for  job here girl

182
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,189
professional opportunities for example something

183
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,219
i always eat  to my friends, right now,

184
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,429
whoever wants to live only lives in Brazil

185
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,739
because the demand for professionals

186
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,110
worldwide is so great that for us

187
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,869
technology professionals

188
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,769
specialized in security with

189
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,319
professional qualifications we can find

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,899
jobs anywhere in the world, okay,

191
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,209
just go  back and quickly you're

192
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,429
employed to work on the photo

193
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,799
Of course if you want to stay in Brazil, it's

194
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,709
super good super respect I'm in

195
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:12,249
Brazil right I like it in Brazil but it's an

196
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,619
example of the consequences of this

197
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,949
scenario there of demand for professionals

198
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,159
and even  I found it interesting in this report

199
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,289
they give it like that, but this reason is by

200
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,869
country, so we can see, for

201
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,189
example, here in Brazil according to

202
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,980
estimates

203
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,670
of 600,000 security professionals

204
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,740
working in Brazil and there is a demand for

205
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,150
300,000, right.  for every

206
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,289
two professionals that generate one more

207
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,510
to meet this demand and the numbers

208
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,280
are all over the world, they're not very

209
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,250
different from that, okay I'll even do it  It's a

210
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,990
school to provoke you,

211
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,150
right, we know that our market,

212
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,070
which has logic and security market,

213
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,180
is predominantly

214
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,850
male in a few women

215
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,520
working in the market, so I ask

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,010
if every two men we would make an effort

217
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,720
to bring one  woman for the

218
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,140
security area we killed this GAP

219
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,480
, this lack of professionals and

220
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,570
solved this this lack of balance

221
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,060
between men and women in the area but they

222
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,470
are spreading what has already been said that

223
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,230
some slides so there is no excuse,

224
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,560
so remembering this.  a

225
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
global scenario is a demand in a fragility

226
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,990
of

227
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,209
is very great so the fragility

228
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,700
for companies and again for us it is an

229
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,529
opportunity that we have to consider this

230
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,020
an opportunity for us to pursue a

231
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,670
career we like in a

232
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,040
company we want from  suddenly in a country or

233
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,860
in a branch that we have, the world

234
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,290
has its doors open for us, it's up to

235
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,470
us, right, to take the initiative to take

236
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,450
control  Read about our career of our life

237
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,120
and say, Puts man I don't know I want to

238
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,100
work in Canada, it's always been my dream,

239
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,580
ok, so the effort, I seek fluency

240
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,880
in English, seek some

241
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,890
specific training and come back, we

242
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,709
can, ok, I have many

243
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,110
colleagues  working in the

244
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,620
area they want in the country they

245
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,540
want so they always received a

246
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,830
job offer because the market is

247
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,470
overheated, right for companies, they

248
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,880
are also challenges rts staff so

249
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,860
nowadays that working relationship between

250
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,970
employer and employee is

251
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,189
the former employer sent

252
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,740
employee  and it was like that and it was very

253
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,199
common you see bosses told you like that

254
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,639
man you have to do everything I do it

255
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,930
has to be like I said I do

256
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,360
it, I do it because you'll never find

257
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,339
a better job out there and I'm already

258
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,189
against it today  he is a good professional, he

259
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:46,689
has so many job offers that he

260
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,209
stays with the company if he wants the

261
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,189
company he wants, okay so we have to

262
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:54,459
use this  o in our favor OK the first

263
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,019
big message there for me the big

264
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,209
news tip of the day but I

265
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,860
ended up not putting an image to

266
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,420
illustrate this here but we

267
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,420
have a lot of difficulty for the new guys to

268
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,759
enter the security job market

269
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,579
it's super as to why this

270
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,959
happens first because companies

271
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,480
think the main factor is actually

272
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,430
because every company wants to hire a

273
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,449
senior professional and Mega ninja

274
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,689
full of requirements paying the salary at

275
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,980
a bargain price at the concession

276
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,170
And then I said that this  It's a

277
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,890
sincere vision of the market all screwed up. After

278
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,340
this, right, and on the other hand, no

279
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,350
company wants to bring a new guy, no

280
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,690
company that is to train a professional, ok,

281
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,430
so everyone is looking for a

282
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,920
professional

283
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,900
.  find it

284
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,450
when you find it six months later in another

285
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,860
company and steal the professional if you

286
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,320
watch the company that you hired did not

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,350
know about your professional, right

288
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,050
?  new to desperate wanting to

289
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,850
enter the market and can't because

290
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,200
there are very few opportunities

291
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,660
for junior professionals to work

292
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,200

305
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,140
time Senior analyst vacancy

306
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,500

311
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,160
there is not

312
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,410


313
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,260


314
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,450
.  They were on the wrong side, right, the

315
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,450
companies' appetite is to try to count on an

316
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,730
analyst who has already graduated, considering that

317
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,770
this is a very limited number of

318
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,529
people and what we need is to bring

319
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,209
new people into their new blood in the

320
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,800
market This companies are not

321
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,410
doing Tabs  the companies that are

322
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,990
concerned about this are really making an effort to

323
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,970
do this kind of thing

324
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,009
and let's be honest, there were the companies

325
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,500
that did, right. There are training programs that are

326
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,480
so concerned about this, but there are several

327
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,949
companies that don't just want to

328
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,829
hire a professional ready.

329
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,509
great difficulty that we

330
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,360
have in this job market to bring

331
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,850
New Blood and for new blood to find a place

332
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,980
in this market, we have to make an

333
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,240
effort to really seek this, and

334
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,579
another aspect is the discrepancy between

335
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,860
men and professionals and opportunities

336
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,839
that the night market gives companies

337
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,089
for men and professionals, you can

338
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,550
easily find surveys on the internet that

339
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,129
show that professionals  female professionals

340
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,819
they are less valued in their

341
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,860
careers they earn room they earn

342
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,389
lower wages than their male colleagues and

343
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,300
they often have fewer

344
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,069
opportunities for career growth

345
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,160
than their male colleagues too, right

346
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,689
I'm just talking about classes and women I  I

347
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:25,600
'm not covering the entire portfolio, right

348
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,980
All the variety of people

349
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,520
and let's go, it's because as our

350
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
market is extremely masculine but it

351
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
ends up being very sexist

352
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,780
and prejudiced too so we give

353
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,260
little opportunity for diversity, that

354
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,080
's also if we  this opportunity comes down,

355
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,490
we could

356
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,590
easily solve this problem of

357
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,020
lack of professionals so you can have

358
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,960
an idea only Twenty percent of

359
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,910
technology professionals are women

360
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,700
Eighty percent are men, right? So I

361
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
have eighty percent of the woman market,

362
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,900
I only have 20 men in Twenty per

363
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,790
one hundred women and I have a

364
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,210
very big lack of professionals if this is

365
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,690
this  proportion was

366
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,940
fifty-fifty, I bet you there would not be

367
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,190
such a lack of professionals in the

368
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,830
market, which is our big problem today,

369
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,790
so we have to work on

370
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,040
this issue of diversity in the area of

371
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,980
technology and this application of

372
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,990
diversity

373
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,750
to safety and not only bring

374
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,339
transgender women LGBT people of the most different

375
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:40,770
colors and variations etc. we have to

376
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,649
know how to respect and it becomes more important,

377
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,149
it is not enough just to bring it is not enough to

378
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,510
simply pick up and fill the truck and

379
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,680
download a lot of women in your company

380
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
you have to know how to respect these

381
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,950
women without  knowing about

382
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,620
equal opportunities for these women, you have to know how to

383
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,440
treat them with equal with equality with

384
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,990
respect, which is even today our

385
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,750
society is not used to doing

386
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,790
this not technology problem this not

387
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,500
security pollutants problems of

388
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,050
our society but within our

389
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,880
world  we have an infinite number of ways

390
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,020
to improve this situation.

391
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,680


392
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,920
s of our famous new normal how

393
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,180
do we stay in this issue of the

394
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,950
academy first pandemic is

395
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,980
growing until today, right? We are

396
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,200
here in Brazil living the second

397
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,660
wave already talking about a third wave and

398
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,880
Brazil is so innovative that we do not

399
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,530
wait, don't even wait for the second wave to end to

400
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,450
start the third we're already in the middle

401
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,460
of the second wave, it hasn't gone down yet,

402
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,630
we're wanting to do the third

403
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,320
wave right?

404
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,970


405
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,610


406
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,470
the number of

407
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,230
dead people is very large, isn't it a pandemic

408
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,550
that is really a social

409
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,340
problem health problem economic plan in no

410
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,530
way do i want to belittle this about

411
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,740
rita i ask my greatest respect for

412
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,440
everyone lost you a relative a

413
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,569
family friend an acquaintance  I think that

414
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,700
practically nowadays it's practically

415
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,030
impossible

416
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,980
and for someone who hasn't lost

417
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,770
an acquaintance at this award,

418
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,410
I'm unfortunately myself with a t  I get

419
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,099
pissed in an ICU today, it's not because of

420
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,390
the video I think everyone there is

421
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,350
going through this so it's people

422
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,860
who are being hospitalized human

423
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,660
beings who are dying Families who

424
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,200
are losing their loved ones are

425
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,240
companies that are closing down because

426
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,180
of  economic problems right from the

427
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,600
quarantine and Lock Down forced to and

428
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,700
we're there fighting and fighting to

429
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,830
try to survive in this issue of

430
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,810
pandemic when we see these numbers

431
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,280
that we formed which was with this

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,580
reality is scary it's scary as a

433
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,550
human being right when you say  that I'm

434
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,130
dying, for example, 12 thousand people a

435
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,490
day in Brazil. That means that, then,

436
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,040
I would say that 10 bonuses fell

437
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,200
in which accident there was on earth in

438
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,630
the 90's here in São Paulo, right then,

439
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,150
falling 10 Boeing per day, the

440
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,630
TAM accident killed  199 people, right, we're

441
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,460
trying to come here who are killing ten

442
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,270
times as much a day here in Brazil,

443
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,860
so these are really

444
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,320
scary numbers.  you don't care, I

445
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,640
do it but you have a little more

446
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,890
awareness you stay at home you protect yourself you

447
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,970
end up depriving yourself of

448
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,430
social contact, depriving yourself

449
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,500
of leisure time that you were used to

450
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,740
because of trying to prevent and prevent the

451
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,080
as  people around you in relation to

452
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,000
no one so it's a social problem it's a

453
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,160
political union Economic problem that

454
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,780
affects everyone I think there's

455
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,570
no one who's going unscathed in this

456
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,240
family it's a different people's point of view

457
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,340
so it's a

458
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,070
very serious concern right.  Morse Lock Down

459
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,020
Here we go here is a photo of

460
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,090
What happened here in São Paulo that for the

461
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,950
first time instituted quarantine in

462
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,230
March 2020, that is, we

463
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,810
have been living this

464
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,770
quarantine crisis situation for more than a year.  collapse in

465
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,930
the health system takes sounds for over a

466
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,570
year living in this

467
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,390
extremely stressful situation, we learned to

468
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,910
live with everyone with a mask, right, the

469
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,710
proposal that these two little signs have

470
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,080
here  in my house it's not a nail on the

471
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,240
door, it's nailed on that house

472
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,120
too, we learned and we were forced to

473
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,940
live with a mask and today it's even part

474
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,430
of our clothing on these days I went

475
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,140
down to get a pizza for delivery

476
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,480
And then I forgot to  put mass it

477
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,580
felt like a naked sequence faced

478
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,710
the rest when I realized

479
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,480
that I was without a mask, I felt like I

480
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,000
was missing some clothes on my body,

481
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,450
right? So this has become a routine

482
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,890
.

483
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,030
Paranoid is now

484
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,510
a time for all of us, right And then we're

485
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,860
all living a

486
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,040
quarantine session some people live

487
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,050
alone two live with relatives live

488
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,680
with relatives right others I live at home with a

489
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,260
lot of people too right so the

490
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,780
situation of living in quarantine  It's not

491
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,940
easy when we talk about which Morse

492
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,430
there is the traditional Home Office there is to

493
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,110
fix the quarantine it's

494
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,330
totally different things the traditional Home Office

495
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,820
normally  even one person

496
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,160
is working at home

497
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,320
while their relatives

498
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,050
are working outside the home, right? The

499
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,100
children are at school, you have

500
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,620
a whole routine of living together, but in the

501
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,450
Home Office of the quarantine, everyone is

502
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,790
in the same space, right, the husband

503
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,740
working online with the wife

504
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,270
who is working online with the

505
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,460
children they are taking online classes and

506
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,170
this whole family nucleus has to

507
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,060
turn around so that that small

508
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,040
family space I can serve everyone for

509
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,410
the decent internet there is a

510
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,170
social program here in Brazil too, right  So

511
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,830
this issue of living in

512
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,830
quarantine lunch during the pandemic period is not a

513
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,750
simple matter, it's not a

514
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,070
simple matter either, and by the way, whoever

515
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,320
has the opportunity to work in the Home

516
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,600
Office at home has a space, it's a blessed one,

517
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,350
right?  large person that

518
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,910
here in Brazil, because the vast majority

519
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,670
of the population does not have a decent job, they do not

520
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,680
have a job that allows them to work from

521
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,380
home and they do  that when there is this

522
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,090
job for me to work from home there

523
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,580
is no longer decent enough domestic texture

524
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,010
for me to work

525
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,660
so whoever has the opportunity to

526
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,150
work in Home Office with their little table

527
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,640
with this little light to make video video

528
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,070
conferencing is a

529
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,170
very Fortune person.  in Brazil, it's the top of the

530
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,120
pyramid, so if you're in this

531
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,020
opportunity, know

532
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,780
and your disadvantaged position, right? And

533
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,120
let's be honest, the vast majority of the

534
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,500
population in Brazil doesn't even have

535
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,380
this internet Vicente, right?

536
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,260


537
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,990
social problems that we have but this

538
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,380
is a subject for another conversation and then

539
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,120
when we do the impact of the gym

540
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,950
at work there are several statistics I

541
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,560
looked for one of them here,

542
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,410
in general, the gym increased

543
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,630
people's stress at work due to the

544
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,330
pressure  of a pandemic situation due

545
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,920
to this pressure of work in the Home

546
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,430
Office, right in the environment is totally

547
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,590
closed with the whole family  locked in the

548
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,190
house too, right? Many companies were

549
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,470
forced to adapt to a tidying up regime

550
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,390
if they didn't have it and they open up with the shampoo

551
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,460
to adapt their way of managing

552
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,770
people is also increasing

553
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,460
stress, right so I think so I

554
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,480
don't think so  I was born in artistic stages

555
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,030


556
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,760
What's with Mia she had a

557
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,800
very big impact on the stress that people

558
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,170
are having a measure of work right and

559
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,030
I see colleagues who are really

560
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,050
stressed so worn out to colleagues

561
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,000
who leave who resigned from the company

562
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,750
who were totally  worn out has

563
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,120
a colleague here asked for 30 days of

564
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,080
vacation because she is totally

565
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,390
stressed out like she will be locked

566
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,190
at home but she will take 30 days stay

567
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,380
disconnected.

568
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,420


569
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,610
I know I can

570
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,860
turn around and say I'm super well I'm

571
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,000
happy I'm not happy The vast majority

572
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,410
of people also identified an

573
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,540
increase in the workload  and they

574
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,180
're also working longer hours because not

575
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,390
everyone can separate properly

576
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,090
If it's the time to stop it's an

577
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,220
increase in the beginning of many work stoppages

578
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,560
in the domestic environment I've already had a

579
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,380
phase where I worked until two three

580
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,040
four five in the morning

581
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,290
This is the Home Office before the gym

582
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,380
this a few years ago because I don't

583
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,420
have to control what time I

584
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,240
have to stop right Unfortunately today I

585
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,980
have and I'll give you two tips the two

586
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,780
things I do I particularly

587
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,180
here right first I defined  for me I only

588
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,620
start working from 10

589
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,030
am because when I

590
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,440
worked at the office the guys

591
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,720
arrived at 10 in the morning so if I

592
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,490
started working at the office at

593
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,840
10 because from home I have to post

594
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,120
work earlier so I put it on break

595
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,620
here, from ten o'clock it also starts to

596
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,710
work, if any WhatsApp e-mail arrives

597
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,650
before 10 o'clock I wait

598
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,090
for 10 o'clock in the morning to start working on

599
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,130
it, right I think  that the excess is

600
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,750
something urgent, access any

601
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,810
important meeting, ok, due to

602
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,880
give due care, but

603
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,010
otherwise I wait from 10

604
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,750
am to start answering then I

605
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,370
could have answered that

606
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,670
WhatsApp before I was there posting here in the

607
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,230
group  family I saw that WhatsApp arrived

608
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,020


609
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,760
the job could have answered before I

610
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,100
could but if I answered that

611
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,040
WhatsApp at 9:30 in the morning I would be giving the

612
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,600
signal at 96 in the morning I was already

613
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
working I'm waiting at 10 to

614
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,590
answer that message ok so I

615
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,420
set it to  me the start

616
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,060
time and I was told the

617
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,560
stop time which is obviously a little more

618
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,660
flexible because I'm not here at the

619
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,390
time I like to stay late when

620
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,980
you start work the work doesn't

621
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,190
stop coming, right but

622
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,350
around the time of the soap opera on the Jornal

623
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,570
Nacional I saw him say so, you

624
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,300
understand, I can stop taking it and now it's

625
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,420
enough, you have to turn it yourself,

626
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,170
talk enough  Let's get some rest Let's

627
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,260
turn on the TV let's watch a series let's

628
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,690
watch Big Brother whatever you understand

629
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,640
but watching Big Brother is less

630
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,260
worse than working until 11

631
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,890
o'clock midnight there right every day so

632
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,650
I set myself a moment  at the

633
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,030
beginning and establish one for me

634
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,210
and take a breakpoint, right I leave the TV

635
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,190
on at the end of the day to have that

636
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,140
detergent noise situation

637
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,970
detergent at home I'm working I saw the

638
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,280
little noise ok that's when I see that

639
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,400
SPTV is starting say  Pa, it's

640
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,000
getting late, right, it didn't even dry, the soap opera that's

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,220
on then say Oops, it's getting there

642
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,950
when it's time to stop. Did the Jornal

643
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,510
Nacional?

644
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,000


645
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,790


646
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,160
from work and I

647
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,140
recommend everyone to do it

648
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,030
otherwise we get really crazy

649
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,520
working late don't realize you

650
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,160
can't disconnect ok this is a

651
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,680
very graphic problem

652
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,950
eeea  people we communities is not to

653
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,990
support us so much in the matter of careers

654
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,330
and there is a pandemic when we talk

655
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,040
about the communities from the point of view of

656
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,230
career the first thing that had the

657
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,290
communities they are a great source of

658
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,380
knowledge us communities where we the

659
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,650
people of  technology we share

660
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,880
our knowledge freely

661
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,460
and there we are talking

662
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,740
online communities discussion forums group on

663
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,860
WhatsApp that Space

664
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,960
specific communities the community exists for

665
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,000
us to share knowledge among ourselves,

666
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,830
not to share it with

667
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,540
us, to learn together that it is very

668
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,110
important, right  other aspects, right? If

669
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,360
you have the opportunity to study

670
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,180
the self software, right, self-learning,

671
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,340
I'll go back to study, right? You have a lot

672
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,320
of quality material shared

673
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,390
by your colleagues, you can stop and

674
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,320
use this material to study

675
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,810
if they

676
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,690
have a lot of p

677
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,879
the materials, I think they have a lot

678
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,759
of study tools too.  So you

679
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,679
have to have all the material at your

680
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,419
disposal for you to study so you can

681
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,190
learn new things at your disposal

682
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,600
it's just a click away, you

683
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,669
're studying you're learning you're

684
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,710
doing more experimenting you have the

685
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,539
opportunity Food building for

686
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:23,399
you  testing new things a curiosity

687
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:27,450
This photo was taken in Garoa, right we

688
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,429
decided to make popcorn in a

689
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:31,110
can, then I had one on the internet how to

690
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,389
make popcorn in a can of

691
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,570
soda and we did it then it

692
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,929
worked, right, the Roots way of making popcorn

693
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:41,909
but we have one from the time that

694
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,169
we don't find out What is the

695
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,409
temperature at which the popcorn explodes, right? Then

696
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,600
we got a heat blower EA

697
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,539
Itaguaí light isn't playing, it's a

698
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,659
heat blower in a big corn popcorn for

699
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,700
us to see and what temperature  from that PE

700
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,760
I was going to get out of the popcorn, right when you have

701
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,380
the opportunity to do this even from

702
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,539
your company, which company will let you

703
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,399
use their equipment, right to measure

704
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,769
at  emperatura in Itapipoca explodes That's not

705
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,049
what you can do in this one Face

706
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,159
can do at home you can

707
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,529
try it at home you can raise

708
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,100
a VM hack it tweak it put a

709
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,659
security setting and if that

710
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:24,279
tool it got it Only really

711
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,889
works right when you're

712
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:29,260
trying it  there community home

713
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,240
with friends you are learning a lot

714
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,850
more things than your work your

715
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,190
work routine allows you to learn

716
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,559
So there is a very cool role, very

717
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,350
fun, very important, of the

718
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,809
Communities, right and a very

719
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,309
important question the issue of the Network you

720
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:47,799
end up getting to know  a lot of people you end up

721
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,080
being known, so for those who are

722
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,149
entering the job market,

723
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:55,570
communities are an excellent

724
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,680
opportunity for you to

725
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,650
meet and become known and

726
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,330
so networking is what moves the

727
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,220
world, and forty percent

728
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,380
of practically the hirings

729
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,260
networking is done in this one

730
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,820
Francisca da, this is more like this pr  The best thing

731
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,180
in practice is now

732
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,350
that we have few

733
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,760
security professionals in this scenario, how do you

734
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,370
think a good professional, right? You have

735
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,680
to have a little professional

736
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,730
usually, by

737
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,670
recommendation, it's the Portuguese word for

738
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,910
the Network, ok then Network you meet

739
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,800
people  will be known by people

740
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,870
is extremely important in

741
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,610
our market and very important for

742
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,060
our career too so participate in

743
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,710
communities will speak at events

744
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,140
put your face to become known

745
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,580
this is very important for your

746
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,050
career What about the academy issue

747
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,300
how things have helped a lot of

748
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,800
people to survive in this moment of

749
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,690
Economy, for example, right

750
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,629
The denial Network versus friendships

751
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,789
we make

752
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,740


753
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,409


754
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,259
pandemic

755
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:16,110
events are online events right mixtapes events

756
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,529
even short videos chat stream  s

757
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,200
etc that help us to keep

758
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,169
up to date and pass the time, since the

759
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:27,029
vast majority of hobbies that we

760
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,250
would have in the traditional world have been

761
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,980
curtailed from us, right folks?

762
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,529


763
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,289
to do

764
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,480
is not excellent, this is an excellent

765
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,100
opportunity to study and learn

766
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,379
more. Communities are playing a

767
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,659
lot as it is with lectures with

768
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,269
events, right? So we have

769
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:50,490
to take advantage of this

770
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,740
quarantine opportunity to study and learn more

771
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,429
is the way to go  geek of surviving a

772
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:57,680
pandemic

773
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,610
Hi and then I would like to finish this lecture, right,

774
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,470
commenting quickly on some of the

775
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,390
Communities, there are many, many,

776
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,250
I ended up leaving out several

777
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,990
questions I could stay here all day

778
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,750
talking about the Communities, right, but I would like to give an

779
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,200
example.  my tribute and

780
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,180
thank any super important

781
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,270
of these communities so when

782
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,580
hackerspaces my bag effects they will come up

783
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,190
m initially in Europe, then it

784
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,450
was the United States and for the rest

785
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,700
of the world with the proposal that you have a

786
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,050
physical space to bring people together in

787
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,270
interacting about the various aspects of

788
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,250
the

789
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,070
hacker culture.

790
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,260
Technology network security in

791
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,900
general and programming we

792
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,910
talk about hardware we talk

793
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,880
about bi rack too

794
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,800


795
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,840


796
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,510
they are

797
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,660
somehow fighting

798
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,890
and this hashtag is the tip here

799
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,020
in Brazil we have several of those did

800
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,030
we the kid who was the first or she

801
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,320
already drying the hacker laboratory in

802
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,380
Campinas we have hacker Face there in the

803
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,480
south right Uchiha that the  we have the Raul

804
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,320
Hacker Club in Salvador it's not the

805
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,220
Calango in Brasília or the Chapecó

806
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,590
sack up there that I caught several,

807
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,410
right, to get some, in fact, we

808
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,360
have several of those made in the  The

809
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,430
kid's website we keep a list of which

810
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,310
races are undone their assets, ok So

811
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,280
it's worth looking there if there's a

812
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,130
Face arc in your city, interacting with

813
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,530
the people, obviously because of the

814
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,720
gym. All those people are

815
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,690
closed, right, we had  that restricting

816
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,120
our activities that were originally

817
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,090
always face-to-face to stop doing

818
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,550
face-to-face activities regarding the academy and

819
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,540
start doing some activities

820
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,670
online is even some here

821
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,880
and they closed the harassment they had, right

822
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,640
because it was very heavy to maintain the

823
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,310
rent and maintain one of the courses

824
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,530
Headquarters at the moment everyone is

825
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,389
locked up at home, some others Here

826
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,830
people continue with the series,

827
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,418
for example, the boy continued

828
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,969
with our headquarters Campinas LHC The site is

829
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,520
still headquartered too, right but you

830
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
of several others who unfortunately

831
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,810
closed  the headquarters kept things and

832
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,090
when we come back to teach, I can

833
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,030
compress them, they will set up a new headquarters

834
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,820
and come back to  face-to-face activities

835
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,020
so it's very important to continue

836
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,909
participating in those fish to continue

837
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,909
fostering these communities

838
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,780

Excel spreadsheet even with all the risks

866
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,329
related to Cloud computing and how

867
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,809
it is referenced  in the

868
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,660


869
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,140

safety standards of the market and it

871
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,190
helps you to say make a check of what you do

872
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,170
here we have it here I don't have it and even

873
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,309

their own certification sk also they have a

875
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,079
lot of material too  for those who want to

876
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,059
specialize in cloud computing security

877
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,890
So also not

878
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,980
very cool community there you produce a lot of

881
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,530
things is also the good top community

882
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,410
super cool that she that they  have

883
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,030
a wise man and sing in the community

884
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,760
of women security essays in Latin

885
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,950
America that has several chapters of

886
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,410
tranquility here in Brazil also that the

887
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,200
The main objective is obviously to encourage

888
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,940
more women in the security market, to

889
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,490
bring more honesty into the market is to get

890
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,049
the women who already have it and help

891
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:57,670
train them even

892
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,880
more and take them even further

893
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,450


894
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,980
.  men to help the

895
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,049
project there he called her they

896
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:12,339
call it laugh China they for them that

897
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,650
basically like that the red people

898
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,210
they allow men interested in

899
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,849
this cause concerned about this to

900
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,609
help bring more conversation help to bring

901
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:25,720
content lecture training spreading

902
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,839
the community  so the jaguar is a

903
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,359
very new and very cool community and

904
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,270
you always have to take things to make

905
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,119
more women like that. They have several

906
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,790
projects including a project to help in the

907
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,099
training of young people help in the training of

908
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,750
professionals. There are only several injection lines,

909
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,839
too, right  it's worth visiting

910
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,720
their website and getting to know the community

911
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,510
but ah I recently made a post on

912
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,530
my blog

913
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,290
Hi e  so i've identified more than 20

914
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,050
communities of women in technology

915
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,980
more than 20 communities that enjoy and

916
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,510
support more women in the area of

917
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,060
technology and security too so

918
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,890
we have to really embrace these

919
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,310
communities, support and back, right and again

920
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,530
make this our community

921
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,540
security and technology is much more

922
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,850
inclusive and diversified for us, there

923
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,990
is nothing to gain from this, right? It's a

924
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,900
very cool community, it's the

925
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,390
binary mind that has the binary chat also

926
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,300
that YouTube channel, right time I'm even with

927
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,070
their mug

928
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,410
here.  which is a guest very

929
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,900
focused on sharing knowledge, the

930
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,910
videos on the channel are really cool.

931
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,130
We talk a lot about careers. There are

932
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,550
free online courses,

933
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,670


934
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,930


935
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,140


936
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,990
right?  There are videos

937
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,650
on the channel almost daily, it's very worthwhile to follow

938
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,300
a really cool community, right, including

939
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,160
Felipe  to introduce me to college, the

940
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,910
Smart rack, the meat, trying to

941
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,970
bring back that original concept in the

942
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,310
Indica rack, it's a cool thing, it

943
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,260
's a good thing, it's something that has to do

944
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,050
with our culture, it's not

945
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,420
necessarily something more rubbish. Rack exists healthy

946
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,550
totally different things but we

947
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,150
have this one, we don't say, we fight

948
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,520
for the Fair use of the word is that no one

949
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,380
will do it for us.

950
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,360


951
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,080


952
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,230
it's bad

953
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,540
to know criminal right Black is the one who

954
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,980
calls what you want but me when everything

955
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,740
You know that minozzo Cyber measured

956
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,200
computer pirates you see each term

957
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,750
like that but it's bizarre being the sides but

958
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,820
they are totally different things

959
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,470
the hacker is not the person who  he wants to

960
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,780
study in order to learn in order to

961
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,210
change things and the guy who is really

962
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,390
wanting to do something bad is in a

963
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,410
community that I recently discovered

964
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,940
that we are all about  n this

965
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,460
time of pandemic, isn't it? And here's my

966
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,830
provocation, also this mental hacker and

967
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,190
he's not starting, there's not

968
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,340
much yet but it's still provocation, right,

969
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,950
we have to think about our

970
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,780
mental health too, we have to think a

971
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,750
lot about our health  again I see

972
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,390
many colleagues who go through

973
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,610
stress go through stressful situations

974
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,130
some know how to solve some don't know ok

975
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,930
I'll lie if I say that I

976
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,520
never participated in my career

977
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,090
I've had several, right

978
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,520
and we have to be able to

979
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,940
survive  we work in this area

980
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,790
without letting stress and consumption

981
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,610
Have your moment of relaxation, your

982
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,520
Hobby, it doesn't matter what it is, it can

983
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,010
be exercising, it can be brewing

984
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,710
beer, it can be watching a series, but

985
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,900
we have to have our moment of

986
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,660
relaxation rest to

987
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,550
survive the market so stressful

988
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,680
and challenging for the security market.

989
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,310


990
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,010
Doubts, we

991
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,480
'll be following you here today

992
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,240
in the chat but also to bring Felipe

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,730
subject Felipe is also a very good person in the

996
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,580

997
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,730
add.  then we take the opportunity and comment on

998
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,620
the various other communities that I don't

999
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,060
talk to him my latest body that

1000
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,070
there are incredible that supports

1001
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,970
and it's not exact man, it's first Thank you

1002
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,130
there for taking this madness with

1003
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,550
us, right finally then I can

1004
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,500
finally say more to  people I who are from

1005
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,270
the security community and in Brazil know, right?

1006
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,030
Didn't want to don't know before, who doesn't

1007
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,590
know anything about information security in

1008
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,970
Brazil. I wish I'm fighting

1009
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,250
again for this chat, I put

1010
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,470
all some things here during the  your

1011
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,570
presentation, right? I think it was

1012
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,030
sensational because he talked about the

1013
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,800
issue of the community school labor market,

1014
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,690
I think he touched on a

1015
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,120
fundamental point, it is essential to talk about

1016
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,940
it, right  And especially when it

1017
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,950
comes to new opportunities, because

1018
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,070
the market is really that

1019
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,740
thing, the incessant search for the Ninja, right, the

1020
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,660
guy who is out of his mind, so

1021
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,100
literally intelligent market is

1022
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,230
that way that pays more, I would end up

1023
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,330
taking it And then don't look  a lot for the

1024
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,820
professional who is looking for a

1025
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,080
change of career or

1026
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,950
and the new guy that I was even marked

1027
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,400
about four five months ago on Linkedin

1028
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,500
a person of cut who is over 45

1029
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,270
years old was a guy with a lot of experience

1030
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,010
in the technology area but  not

1031
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,750
security for about a year

1032
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,550
two that he was studying and security

1033
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,980
and still didn't have an opportunity he

1034
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,260
was clamoring for an opportunity in

1035
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,610
information security and it was

1036
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,170
interesting in the post he did that he

1037
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,420
wrote so I accept a

1038
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,420
Junior position  I want to enter the area And then I

1039
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,010
saw a network there, it was cool, we

1040
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,680
started talking to you in the

1041
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,080
private conversation and everything worked out well he

1042
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,270
got a job  it wasn't on my

1043
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,260
continent of the company that I work

1044
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,900
today, it was another company but that

1045
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,910
caught my attention because it came to this point,

1046
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,619


1047
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,380
right everyone, training people needs to help

1048
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,269
them, right?

1049
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,769


1050
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:29,960
situation, so if we talk about

1051
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,490
a community, for example, how

1052
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,079
are we doing the event, right, but I didn't even make

1053
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,299
a soundtrack in Portuguese organized by

1054
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,700
a community called close by

1055
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,680
in the United States, right, in theory, he

1056
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,039
expects the founders solar is the  overboard the

1057
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,549
diosef and there must be more people like that,

1058
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:49,700
right What do you want to organize the channel of

1059
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,440
disagreement in this man and then stay there in the

1060
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,359
comments

1061
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,519


1062
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,740


1063
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,960


1064
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,829
about bertin about by.  About

1065
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,809
the rainbow tinel, there are many things that

1066
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,970
we have for sure today among all

1067
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,920
the things we play with a lot, huh,

1068
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,769
chat about the debate about

1069
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:15,950
certifications about this one about this

1070
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,630
pandemic

1071
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,839
issue, the cheating mental issue, right?

1072
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,849
I'm looking at my willing and a

1073
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,339
lot of community and I literally I

1074
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,490
agree with you dear when you talk about the

1075
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,289
Community of events, right I'm

1076
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:33,839
particularly known but it gets into my

1077
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,490
head Garcia has nothing Secure

1078
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:38,190
your 2015 And then I started to know the

1079
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,289
community, right and get to know  the people the

1080
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,019
community And then it's interesting that

1081
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,420
we were communities there, or if, for

1082
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,190
example, I've already sent an e-mail there to be

1083
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,480
able to participate in

1084
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,329
voluntary matters because I agree, right This

1085
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:53,460
sharing the same opinion as you,

1086
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,200


1087
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,190
right?  so it's not because it's

1088
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,079
focused on developing or

1089
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,089
helping women in the labor market in

1090
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:05,369
technology and also safety and a man

1091
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,809
doesn't  you can participate, on the

1092
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,099
contrary, I think we have to be a

1093
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,109
volunteer and believe in it too,

1094
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:14,009
so I think it's sensational

1095
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:16,319
as many communities have promised and today

1096
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,640
what we have most is

1097
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,760
and to talk and chat, right That's

1098
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,890
what calls remembering a point  It's also

1099
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,810
very cool, it's something I had to

1100
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,510
discuss, right, password that has today there's a lot of

1101
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,400
content on the internet, it's super easy for you to

1102
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,590
have access to content, but it's very

1103
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,570
difficult to separate even

1104
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,690
quality content that happened from the bad, right

1105
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,040
then there's a concern  very large number

1106
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,470
of professional colleagues and communities

1107
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,840
in this type of people who

1108
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,030
seek knowledge on the internet are worth trying

1109
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,280
to graduate using bad content, they

1110
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,950
will graduate full of holes in their

1111
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,290
education in their education in the kidneys in

1112
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,180
install, then unfortunately they will not be a good

1113
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,130
professional  navigation

1114
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,930
very big effort in terms of time

1115
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,240
I have dedication and if I try to get a

1116
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,730
bad content it will graduate very badly and

1117
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,520
the c  omunities charge this hole in the

1118
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,260
communities you said, door in a

1119
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,180
lot of control in the community in

1120
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,130
discord' ok I'm sure all

1121
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,210
the content is of excellent quality it

1122
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,610
's just because the ones that are

1123
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,160
freely available that you can eat in

1124
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,619
your time

1125
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:21,470
Nerf at any time This is the

1126
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,970
quality content, whether the

1127
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,130
communities also help you to

1128
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,049
separate this chaff from the wheat,

1129
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:29,690
you naturally end up getting involved

1130
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,599
in a group of people who are already

1131
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,890
more experienced for those who are

1132
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,230
starting in the field, right?  the young woman

1133
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,759
doesn't because she's changing trucks it

1134
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:41,329
doesn't matter, but you have access to quality content,

1135
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:44,690
right in front of ASP,

1136
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,630
it's the open world, yes, of knowledge

1137
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,470
about really safe

1138
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,720


1139
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,259
So much material so much

select what is good for you to

1148

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,130
in saxony in various interviews are

1151
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,400
excellent  super cool but they have

1152
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,490
they create a lot of videos they are born there are some

1153
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,400
courses there so let's go there exposing

1154
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,089
geographically forget it with

1155
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:36,529
sensational excellent ones,

1156
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:42,690
please, I think it's fundamental, right, it

1157
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,210
's very strong, right, doing one of the

1158

I can even get the defenses with

1160
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,940
groups spread across Brazil and around the

1161
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,009
world, right and in Brazil today I'll be

1162
00:47:53,009 --> 00:47:54,839
able to form part of the defense a São Paulo group from

1163
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,299
that part of the team organization

1164
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,430
So there's a lot of that, so we

1165
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,980
chat a lot about the type of  content, right?

1166
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,569
I think it's another

1167
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,430
example from

1168
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,200


1169
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,119
the inside  of a content, right, so

1170
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,980
there's this filter, as you said, it

1171
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,089
also asked to accept any

1172
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,730
content and to give a career guidance to the

1173
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,549
independent people, right, regardless of the

1174
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:18,640
sex

1175
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,240
in 24, that's possible, right, or I'm an

1176
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,339
example of that, right, I've been for six years  I

1177
00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:26,319
was coming from a sales career, you

1178
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,869
understand, it's unimaginable to think that I

1179
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:31,630
could develop a technical career

1180
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,140
in security, right and I even did one, I

1181
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,269
gave an interview at the cast point with

1182
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,069
Felipe, who is one of Elaine's Uai blinds,

1183
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:40,809
he invited me to  to be the

1184
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:42,940
first one also spent my guest

1185
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,160
and he I told him man I was

1186
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,200
Diogo's salesman, you understand I had to

1187
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,579
explain to him in English that

1188
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:50,440
the possible car was the script.

1189
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,059


1190
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:53,769
And then there are a lot

1191
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,440
of egg trays and I used to pass by the village

1192
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,210
telling the neighbor that he only wants to buy

1193
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,220
30 eggs is one in my time he doesn't want

1194
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,869
something today I should have it here but

1195
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,740
you understand.  Yes, an

1196
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,039
expensive career, if I got it, it's possible, it

1197
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,130
's just us who did it. Maybe the

1198
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,660
most experienced ones are within this

1199
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,760
community, security, right?

1200
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,619


1201
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,319


1202
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:23,900
I feel bad for

1203
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,730
those who are watching us, please I

1204
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,160
love to go up to the general safety school community,

1205
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,740
the club is already in and

1206
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,230
they support them, right?

1207
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,029


1208
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:37,009


1209
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:39,499
and I, for example,

1210
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,630
received it above, I'm talking about my

1211
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,150
career, I make plans for a month and a half I

1212
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,009
'm seeing this a

1213
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:48,319
development community of dad you don't to

1214
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,349
not need it here and dad I don't want to

1215
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:53,269
understand how the developer's mind works

1216
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:55,369
Paiva to this I am

1217
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,859
immersed in a comment studying

1218
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,749
peace studying the pay structure of

1219
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,529
conditionals studying pairs understanding

1220
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:05,329
employees understanding collections how

1221
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,579
my conversation works  ersa being a

1222
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:10,400
developer conversation here it's crazy

1223
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,680
son it's not the basis I believe in the

1224
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,390
community that I have to study the

1225
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,509
basis for the head notified to be able to

1226
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:18,630
later I'll come to mine

1227
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,660
you already know I said this one that

1228
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,789
I would need to do this  no but I

1229
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:26,279
want to learn it's my wish I want to

1230
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:27,660
go running I learned from the community that

1231
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,759
I need to lay the foundations, right? So

1232
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,480
it's chronology encompasses everything right?

1233
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,950


1234
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:39,180


1235
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,160
diversified then

1236
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,170
you suddenly entered a community You want to

1237
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,180
learn safety for example Go focus

1238
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,099
here on safety right Then you meet

1239
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,720
a community There you are You are

1240
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,119
repeating interacting there and you think the

1241
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,559
communities are toxic because sometimes

1242
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,750
there is a community alone there

1243
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,700
toxic people these  communities you're not

1244
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,380
going to stay people ends up leaving the one

1245
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,390
that gives me that person I've already done that

1246
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,279
I've stopped participating in communities

1247
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:04,230
because of  one or two toxic people

1248
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,079
got it, but like that There are so many

1249
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,880
communities, thank God in this one

1250
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,369
unfortunately it's that you have

1251
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,869
freedom, community here is

1252
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,029
not serving me not talking about the type

1253
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:16,740
of knowledge I want I'm going to get

1254
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,640
the other, right today

1255
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,520
we have several of them  there are half a dozen

1256
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,700
but I left out another 60 or I

1257
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,080
always know there, right Oh and there are a lot of those

1258
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,340
with heartache because otherwise I'll stay

1259
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,690
with you here just talking about the

1260
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,560
Communities, so we're having this

1261
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,330
opportunity for something you said

1262
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,120
like that  right, security is also one of the

1263
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,400
technology things, but it feels like

1264
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,230
taking the little world of security if it uploads our

1265
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,960
video we have careers

1266
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,440
within security ok guy who takes a test

1267
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,140
it's not the same style as the guy who does

1268
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,450
blueteam it's not the same  squirrel of the guy

1269
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,210
who does forensics is not the meanest

1270
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,120
of the guy who does it here design

1271
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,800
security architecture it's all the

1272
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,600
squirrels that complement each other Vasco it's

1273
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,190
nice to know a little bit  I do everything

1274
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,650
because the first person who is cool is

1275
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,660
fun but because they complement each other

1276
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,400
but so when

1277
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,290
you enter the career, you start to

1278
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,120
specialize in the specific subject,

1279
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,619
so the specialization courses,

1280
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:21,440
the test, are not totally different

1281
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,049
from the specialization courses  who works at

1282
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:26,450
luck do blueteam and who are

1283
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,549
super nice and super valid legs or

1284
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:31,430
something I already got for my health I want to

1285
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,680
study more about soft I was at home

1286
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,170
working in a blueteam ok someone went there

1287
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,089
recommend i recommend taking a

1288
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,819
pentest course i  I said nice guy, it's worth

1289
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:42,680
doing, you know, it's one more knowledge

1290
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,390
you deliver so you know how to

1291
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,799
defend you have to know how to attack so

1292
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,509
you know how to attack always put you

1293
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:50,509
defend OK, but for you to specialize

1294
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:52,549
in that area of work You have to

1295
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:55,549
focus only on your little money  if it's

1296
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:57,319
with the best course I don't take in

1297
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,960
that area, because the employer will

1298
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,630
look at that there, you understand.  it's just

1299
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,769
that he's going to talk to someone else you know how to

1300
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:05,509
hack that's cool It's super worth

1301
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,730
my bad Greek but that one else wants to

1302
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,960
know if you know how to use the plans that the

1303
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,960
blog paces in the air water Leo solution xyz

1304
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,049
right Or be it the solution of the day it  that

1305
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:18,630
person

1306
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,240
is from that career so only

1307
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,160
knowledge that complements each other and

1308
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,960
again we have a very

1309
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,789
cool opportunity that accident

1310
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:29,190
technology we have several trees

1311
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,809


1312
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:34,500


1313
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,500
I open there was another one of them is

1314
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,779
that we must be agitated, we have

1315
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:42,269
a letter part of the other, it's

1316
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:43,380
something I'm starting to do now I

1317
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,599
want to work with concentration and

1318
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,430
working with human beings, there's something

1319
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,720
that is a separate challenge  There are also

1320
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,049
people who are complacent about security,

1321
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:58,259
and people who keep seeing

1322
00:53:58,259 --> 00:54:01,950
regulations, creating and revising standards,

1323
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,470
etc. I am part of the benitec group

1324
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,630
that magazine Listen to security standards

1325
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,599
you understand I needed to do this,

1326
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,549
I didn't need to, but it's a part

1327
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:13,980
of society, the community

1328
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,559
because there's nothing here, you can

1329
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,640
even do it here

1330
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,750
at ABNT, ok so it's a little help,

1331
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,309
I'm kind of making the community and

1332
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:27,039
society the mask  by pentest he will be

1333
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,400
able to read an ABNT standard he kills himself

1334
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,390
understand why it's boring for dudes But

1335
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,150
even and the guy who wrote the standard if

1336
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,160
you play him a bar ask

1337
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,349
him to see it now find vulnerability on the

1338
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:43,510
site he won't get it was

1339
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,519
knowledge  that complement each other and

1340
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:47,529
we have to know how to live with this one with

1341
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:49,480
this diversity of knowledge and

1342
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,069
get a little face that

1343
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:53,500
interests you and train as a professional

1344
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,869
I think it's super worth

1345
00:54:55,869 --> 00:54:59,170
it.

1346
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,460
the communities they help a

1347
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,650
lot is what we should hear a

1348
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,680
lot about it, right Just like me and whoever

1349
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,849
ends up showing up a little more End up

1350
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:09,730
listening to it, right Where do I start, right

1351
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:13,089
what do I do  OK, so yes, it's in a

1352
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:14,680
community, I think it spoke well on the

1353
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,589
issue of how to detox or it's not perfect

1354
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:18,619
I thought you did

1355
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,660
n't comment when we talk about

1356
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,029
learning this, you're talking about

1357
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,200
something else I said,

1358
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,170
it's being  human each human being has

1359
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,660
its own learning model So as

1360
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,299
much as I say, do it, don't you

1361
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:35,029
understand it that way

1362
00:55:35,029 --> 00:55:37,519
so I don't have 15 hair at home.

1363
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:39,799


1364
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:41,329
the same mother that my

1365
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:44,390
brother we open spreads his mother me and they

1366
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,220
started a similar career, right I

1367
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,019
started doing the initial process he

1368
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:50,150
went to do it with me is ab I finished

1369
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,339
he didn't finish because he said EA

1370
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:54,470
to me it's not possible I have to  to be in

1371
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,109
person there in the career I used to buy

1372
00:55:57,109 --> 00:56:00,440
then I'll go commercial I resurrected

1373
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,499
a job technician for security he

1374
00:56:03,499 --> 00:56:05,390
went there and became a waiter today I live in

1375
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,180
Portugal and he's doing computer

1376
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,930
skills hahaha face-to-face But what what Why

1377
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,059
el  and there's the learning model so,

1378
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:16,190
for example, I was studying Python, right

1379
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,170
Then I told him, man, look at the

1380
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:18,630


1381
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,119
videos about Guanabara that I just got to

1382
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,220
know about a programming language.

1383
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,589


1384
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:26,880
I remember the

1385
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,160
name I went to look at the videos and I said

1386
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,230
man of the time because the didactic for me is

1387
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,079
not worth it no no not

1388
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,970
fit for him it fit say the

1389
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,160
man the man showed the camera and way

1390
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,559
I don't know I couldn't do it

1391
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,289
league exactly brought each human being

1392
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:45,420
we have a learning model that

1393
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,059
can recommend, right, negative see

1394
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,880
YouTube right and so on more

1395
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,789
discover how best and

1396
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,950
also the community will listen to

1397
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,750
various types of examples and will have

1398
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,849
to add a lot to you until  a

1399
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,349
personal example and it's going to be happening now

1400
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:03,680
it wasn't a place because of the academy and then I'm

1401
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,329
looking for things to do to

1402
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:09,660
refresh my mind this week and I

1403
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,130
started taking a course in  French at the Alliance

1404
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,230
Française I signed up for the French course,

1405
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,369
right, basic French, brother joar is flying,

1406
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,640
that's not

1407
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,280
the cost, it's totally online because,

1408
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,750
nowadays, it's totally online when

1409
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,600
I took an English course. Spanish course

1410
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,510
was all in-person, right classroom  ok

1411
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,850
Teacher or private teacher who used

1412
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,700
to go to your work ok I'm not

1413
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,670
taking classes online right I bought a

1414
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,170
book because I don't know how to live without fear

1415
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,490
but this step we don't know how to buy

1416
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,680
the book that has a PDF handout but I

1417
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,540
need  I'm not even using a book, I'm not

1418
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,360
using it right, right,

1419
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,520
I'm putting things on paper because I'm

1420
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,910
a guy who, for me to learn, I

1421
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,560
need to scribble, write everything

1422
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,580
I know that many people don't, if

1423
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,130
I assimilate the knowledge they have  that

1424
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,260
enter the ear through the eye, pass through the

1425
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,180
brain and reach the hand and the paper that

1426
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,750
I don't absorb either, but that

1427
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,280
's also the way sometimes before

1428
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,550
learning, right ah, there are people in the end

1429
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:18,310
who don't  He used a notebook like that, classmates

1430
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:18,619


1431
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:21,140
and here each blank table, this lady

1432
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,190
I believe in the room understood, so it's kind of

1433
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,779
important that each person has their way

1434
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:30,289
of learning, right and communities they

1435
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:32,960
end up in a way giving space to

1436
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,299
everyone in this inside  the

1437
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:37,249
same community has several ways to

1438
00:58:37,249 --> 00:58:38,930
learn and one thing I think is

1439
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,390
coolest that I see more interesting than

1440
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:44,210
I see in those fish, this issue

1441
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,670
of collective learning, ok because it

1442
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,640
's something I always do, all of

1443
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,200
us were raised within  a model

1444
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,539
where For you to learn for you to

1445
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:55,609
study you have to put a

1446
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:57,740
classroom Where there's a guy in front who is

1447
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,319
an Expert a guy or a woman that

1448
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,960
Expert Expert in the area and keeps

1449
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,029
vomiting content at you and you sit

1450
00:59:05,029 --> 00:59:07,400
passively taking notes and  listening to what the

1451
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,279
person says and assimilating that,

1452
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:12,049
those fish, they have this

1453
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,509
culture of collective learning so

1454
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,710
if you arrive, you won't have a

1455
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,140
face that  it's having an activity it's not

1456
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,630
a person

1457
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,089
at a lecture it's a crowd sitting

1458
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:23,519
at a table doing everything together, it's ok

1459
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,460
, you know, you get in there in the middle

1460
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,200
so let me do it too help me

1461
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,519
then Carnival will help you around do

1462
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:31,890
something else to  join Aunt Júlia ok and

1463
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,710
I see it often in the fish bag,

1464
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:37,230
right when we had the guy in

1465
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,849
attendance and he will soon come

1466
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:42,210
back, everyone, when he

1467
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,099
first comes in contact with hackers Face

1468
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,529
always that traditional

1469
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:48,059
Duty mentality to get there and  there will be someone who

1470
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:50,190
will pick you up and put you on a

1471
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,410
chair in a classroom and will give you

1472
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,900
a class and actually that's not it, it's just

1473
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,579
those images that I presented there,

1474
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:58,259
everyone around a table

1475
00:59:58,259 --> 01:00:02,009
doing four five six  brothers understood this

1476
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,359
is a need for collective this is a

1477
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,039
learning model that we don't

1478
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,900
have in our daily life that we don't

1479
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,430
have in the work that we don't have in

1480
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,069
the classroom, right And that complements you That

1481
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,019
I kind of add that learning

1482
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:15,869
through experimentation through help was

1483
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:18,640
always in my community of it's you

1484
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,130
and this one doesn't, don't know that the dear

1485
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:24,309
Mr. Professor graduated teaching the

1486
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:26,380
basics don't you have people that each one

1487
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,109
manages more or less and without so together they

1488
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:30,970
add knowledge  and it doesn't with all

1489
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,760
the two learned together ok that's a

1490
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,559
very nice thing of very

1491
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:38,470
rich communities very rich indeed yes I do the

1492
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,039
same and I remember 2015 when I

1493
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,690
met her two HC And then when I

1494
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,099
met her there and it wasn't much

1495
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,809
It's interesting that I went to Garoa and

1496
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,039
that's exactly what I got

1497
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:49,630
there to get there, there will be someone lecturing, right, it

1498
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,750
's the same I had come from another

1499
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,420
world, right?

1500
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,700


1501
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,039
power seems like Someone

1502
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:02,140
said something dude start tinkering with

1503
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,119
electronics if talking about it I'll

1504
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,740
get there to see if the first time

1505
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,109
big camel dog or there in the pit

1506
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:10,059
bull dog bunch right there isn't a tin room  there's

1507
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:11,799
a lot of sitting at a table as well As it

1508
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:14,349
went and playing with electronics and

1509
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:16,539
talking and talking people like that

1510
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,460
on the walls like this decorated talking

1511
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:18,619
on

1512
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:21,319
the guy that's right that's the atmosphere of

1513
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:27,279
the cigar net community, right I think I

1514
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:31,910
came here to learn Arduino  but you see

1515
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:37,549
there in that box there is that one starts to

1516
01:01:37,549 --> 01:01:54,049
do and a lot of people a lot of people get

1517
01:01:54,049 --> 01:02:00,859
there you go away you weren't used

1518
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:05,420
to this kind of education this

1519
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,609
learning model we were

1520
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:09,950
used to the traditional model of

1521
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,589
the teacher's classroom spewing knowledge

1522
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:17,059
in the head  of the students passively and

1523
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:18,630
like that again we said

1524
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:24,299
hello how are you, so this is the environment

1525
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:27,690
I don't know the communities Open I

1526
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,940
believe in you say Sometimes Depending

1527
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,309
on who's there, right For some reason it did

1528
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:34,380
n't work out and go to another one with another

1529
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,150
get along really well and have a model of

1530
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,569
learning and grow and evolve so that they

1531
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:41,640
keep making this exchange, fine, right

1532
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,289
knowledge that I think is more

1533
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:45,180
important. Sometimes the  we schedule there

1534
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,099
so the Arduino night you get there

1535
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:48,420
everyone is talking about Star Wars, you

1536
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,859
understand, you know the anthem, man who

1537
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:54,809
's doing it, don't you want to understand,

1538
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:57,329
then he totally talks about the

1539
01:02:57,329 --> 01:02:59,730
lack of CE programming there and then we

1540
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,730
open  there an app and it starts to wake up,

1541
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,920
got it And then say it if it was Look I'm

1542
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,289
with it here let's root And then someone goes

1543
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:10,890
there and brings an old msx to make it

1544
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,799
work But you want the night to give the

1545
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:17,160
anthem Yeah but [ __ ] it is too  here and

1546
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,640
I'll be discussing it up

1547
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,230
and down, you know, it's Our geek culture

1548
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,380
that we have to value And there I

1549
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,930
think it's cool that we

1550
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,030
can do this I can do Rap, right,

1551
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,060
I brought this this

1552
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,940
American project that we  even the

1553
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,730
guy participates is sensational because nowadays

1554
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:41,020
we're afraid to say no I'm a

1555
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,320
hacker because we still don't

1556
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,130
unconsciously end up associating right

1557
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:48,430
[ __ ] it's a bad guy right dammit it's a

1558
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,070
creative guy right There's a stage number 6

1559
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,290
talk in a  from the interviews about

1560
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,200
who he does he talks about the mouse he

1561
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,120
's a creative guy and it's one of the

1562
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,310
phrases right there in the pencil on the beach and it's

1563
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,900
interesting to see people thinking about the

1564
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,370
United States so we'll go to

1565
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:06,190
Europe and Africa a  people in Australia it's a

1566
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,260
matter of politics us Congratulations

1567
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,120
Uruguay and it was very interesting

1568
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,640
first Uruguay was arrested I'm going to make

1569
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,440
a rack it takes one night I don't know if

1570
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,560
material was arrested and then explain He

1571
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,619
counts 50

1572
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:21,559
the crazy one that is nothing more than this

1573
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:24,619
concept  de Neves, you can't look at the loose I

1574
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:27,200
wanted to delay I wanted to show you that I wanted to

1575
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,259
be creative but it's

1576
01:04:30,259 --> 01:04:33,619
cool and you open there if there's the G1 any

1577
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:37,249
press service is there fine it

1578
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,170
's cover news arrested the biggest hacker in Brazil

1579
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,319
when we the criminal understood  she said you

1580
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,789
know I want it's naughty driven

1581
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:49,249
it's really stealing the pensioner's money you

1582
01:04:49,249 --> 01:04:58,069
know it's just

1583
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:00,799
something funny like I'm a super fan of

1584
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,329
Igor right Tauan they're some of the

1585
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:06,920
few professionals in  security that

1586
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,440
they are they have embarked very cool

1587
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,200
on our new social networks and

1588
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,450
communication platform if they put their

1589
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,339
own Instagram and they are

1590
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:17,809
sharing a lot of cool stuff even the

1591
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:18,630
project is really

1592
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:24,799
cool Senac is like a CPF style it's

1593
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,599
sports right so it's a  CPF with

1594
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,329
narrative, right, so it's an event model

1595
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:33,119
that they created, by the way, it

1596
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,970
's very cool, isn't it another model

1597
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,410
that I think is very cool, very

1598
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,960
interesting, very fun to

1599
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,970
watch. And they use social media a lot

1600
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:45,750
and they  go through something

1601
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:48,059
that we go through in Garoa so that it's all the

1602
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:50,430
time someone comes to see that the

1603
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:52,529
hacker community Get in there and talk next

1604
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:54,450
help is needed to hack Facebook

1605
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,750
invade my ex-girlfriend's

1606
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,400
Instagram only we'll take it off

1607
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,259
I want to tell you that I

1608
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:03,839
don't know how you're in the

1609
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,970
wrong group right here in the quiet here it's hacker

1610
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,240
in the sense of that one day use of

1611
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,380
knowledge right it's not a bad guy v  You want a

1612
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,119
bad guy, got it? You want to make cream,

1613
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,650
go put a bad guy Don't talk to

1614
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,509
us but don't tell you that I don't,

1615
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:17,160
since you want to do is look for a

1616
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,640
bad guy

1617
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,680
we security is connected to the

1618
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,599
networks we listen a lot on this demand

1619
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:25,539
ok, do mine do mine here for

1620
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:28,240
me this and I'll want another

1621
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,549
one

1622
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:32,170


1623
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:35,680


1624
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,240
I recover

1625
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,010
Instagram password. Answer me like this, from the

1626
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,170
table, dude, do you have a forgot password, or

1627
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,140
call the bank. They made it easy

1628
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,849
not to understand that a way without

1629
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:47,859
doing this, there's no way to do it in your

1630
01:06:47,859 --> 01:06:49,779
person, which is a nice thing to

1631
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,960
not do that itching  ok, because of the

1632
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,359
criminal, we don't do this service

1633
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,579
here, don't say that we don't do that

1634
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,710
, it's information security, don't do that

1635
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:02,260
so but that's it, it's a fight,

1636
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,349
we'll keep talking about it here. I

1637
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:06,819
wanted to thank you, needy  open a

1638
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,470
space there for the words signs, right

1639
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,890
brigade in your time, right then, the

1640
