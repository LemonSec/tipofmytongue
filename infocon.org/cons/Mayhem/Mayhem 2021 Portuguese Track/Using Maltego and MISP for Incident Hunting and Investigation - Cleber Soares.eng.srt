8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,090
for me to search

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,900
for accident investigation in it's better Vitória

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,820
Soares here now I'm going to tell

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,550
me this I started the idea of what are

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,449
doing the technical course helped after

13
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,869
that times my graduation and postgraduate studies

14
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,890
instead of  another order the new tip that

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,240
it is known that the milk graduates Sem

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,910
Floresta and I complete in the area that

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,250
if this and I answer I am an

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,780
information security analyst good is that I

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,610
bring some events it is not that I am

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,470
part of it but not an example of

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,540
get christmas his focus is to join the three

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,900
trees in digital law computing

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,620
forensics and information security of his

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:49,060
saying Chapter ASP Belém I am saw and

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,490
left it recently so

26
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,820
holding my and so magazine no  its

27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,970
as the cover and then it's exactly the theme of

28
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,430
our presentation basically so

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,679
let's quickly right,

30
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,950
Google Maps is basically when

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,269
we talk about security right we

32
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,959
always have the layers of protection that

33
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,530
I have a Siena laxus Fairy dance feet

34
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,139
called security but we implement

35
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,829
guarantee a  security we know that

36
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:39,799
100% Léo tupia security we

37
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,240
always try

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,480
and make it a little more difficult, before

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,040
it would not be based on that.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,710


41
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,510


42
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:12,040
top 10 is not a

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,020
very interesting survey, he

44
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,340
says that the estimate of damages in faith

45
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,580
2005 is 10 million, right annually, observe

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,860
that attackers don't play, no,

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,030
on top of that, I'm going to make a small

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,510
presentation here, look at

49
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:43,250
the animal on the screen, so knowing  that Finn

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,829
if he is one of the machines that know Top 10

51
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,620
Electro Kids here is part of the concept of

52
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,659
presentation so basically

53
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,250
we always wanted to do the

54
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,299
co campaign  awareness in the last ones when there is

55
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,120
someone who receives that email that

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:24,199
ends up breaking, right And here next to the

57
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,470
machine 1

58
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,670
, André's birthday meaning to who he

59
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,590
is

60
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,510
and the card I have a c2d Remembering

61
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,420
that this is not for

62
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,530
educational purposes  are basically that it would be

63
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,130
the attacker's C2 made a mistake already the company

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:05:00,190
user pretend trishna icon I already have the

65
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,160
information that will leave here,

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
o user

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,250
Joãozinho Pedro Conde down and receive

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,710
a file and say that he was going to report

69
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,860
2020, no one will open it and it will download

70
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,529
the file and execute it

71
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,409
the speech from below where he headed that he wanted

72
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,350
a Shrek at the end of

73
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,880
the rain

74
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,710
that Patricia already downloaded it,

75
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,639
increase it a little bit 1

76
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,700
the report, right

77
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,090
I don't know it will it will open it

78
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,920
doesn't know about it, it

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,569
's basically  what's going to happen there, oh,

80
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,360
his goal is not to be encrypted, that

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,060
's

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,500
good Rangers so don't be made of metal so much

83
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,930
his machine, right as the other

84
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,970
machines, depending on Tocantins

85
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,070
knowing it before, a great part of it already knows  in

86
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,340
making a cake cast there, right to

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,950
paint, tried to record as much as it marks

88
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,440
Zé Tô Anyway so here for users you've already

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,930
had your machine compromised in that of

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,060
a king so on and on the other side

91
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,220
of the attacker himself

92
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,470
Hi bug, the attacker appeared here  already

93
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,960
received all the information the same

94
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,190
machine the empire the time

95
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,160
I don't know if all the information is not

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,080
the information of your victim it is

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,050
so do it like you didn't even have to enter now

98
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,290
the response team we feel a

99
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,260
truth not here to be able to know  right but it

100
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,090
was like the tram broke then

101
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,759
the head and

102
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,759
G1

103
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,930
and you're going to break it wins more process

104
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,700
friends

105
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,760
Andthen

106
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,340
I

107
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,210
'm coming back to our presentation here

108
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,029
Andthere

109
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:51,310
and you those Guys should be here and do

110
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,220
n't let security

111
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,759
here basically head of security

112
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,220
and any unwanted or

113
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,550
unexpected event that is confirmed or

114
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,310
suspected related to compromising

115
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,370
operating system and

116
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,300
personal data network security exposure ace  Unauthorized ss

117
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,590
and system modifications

118
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,320
without knowledge in

119
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,920
Good morning, I grew up too, right

120
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,840
in front of what would be in short, right

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,830
is this incident response?

122
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,039
Incident response a set of methodologies

123
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,130
that aim to contain and minimize the impacts

124
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,979
of a  city incident comply are the

125
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,030
result of an attack and dies use or even

126
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,020
a large proportion of disaster this phrase

127
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,110
here is a great friend of ours, right,

128
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,570
and let's event that the game Antônio where

129
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,339
this even a little bit that would be an

130
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,399
incident response is following here

131
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,399
so  we talked about fincher And we

132
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,140
also talked about ren waiting so I

133
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,399
did a research in the past, it's

134
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,990
basically yes if your company

135
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,220
suffered a raffle attack with salvation

136
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,040
you would be aware of some

137
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,680
options here with one of turning off the

138
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,490
computer to Rescue  of Disconnect

139
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,490
all cables and give to the support is

140
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,470
scared but don't be calm because type

141
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,660
of mat or tries to solve the incident

142
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,649
or other options  tions there and the result here

143
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,880
PSOL

144
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm here at Silêncio's bar yes last year

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,740
no one gave more than 20

146
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,920
billion voices so it's the result here between the

147
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,030
next 1479 g36 and almost 15

148
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,530
of these days so basically ac39

149
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,650
percent don't get scared  no longer

150
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,080
keep calm because the person is very

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,800
nice is not the second option then try to

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,170
solve incidents as usual and the

153
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,010
other option disconnect everything, right connect

154
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:33,120
by accidents in ideal you have to

155
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,640
isolate the machine here from the esports forensic dentist

156
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,860


157
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,620
and pick up the machine later  who suffered

158
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,750
So, if you're going to try to make a

159
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,660
Dante, we're going to try to do some

160
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,460
procedures to try to see if

161
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,880


162
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Sigma Cristina can get anything from me, then it's in the

163
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,910
methodology that I used oppressed it here from the

164
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,970
beginning, right, it's basically going to be on

165
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,760
top of  response on the back of the incident

166
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,259
on top

167
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:20,799
Ah ok it's good with me for your title

168
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,339
so basically here we're

169
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,479
using garbage here, no altruism right

170
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,259
So you're talking [ __ ]  I hate a little about

171
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,559
them here so I can believe it's the

172
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:40,949
evil delight, right, soft, right,

173
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:45,039
developed by the screen, right, with everything

174
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,660
to get information

175
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,809


176
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:58,299


177
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,509


178
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,239
acknowledgment that the maximum amount of information in the

179
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,869
job and several and that have already

180
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:13,269
used Morte and our next one takes the

181
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,270


182
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,300
same what would be the normal

183
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,420
information on platform visa then a

184
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,050
tip How to set up the thought of

185
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,010
sharing action  in which and you

186
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,060
can do the following you can do the

187
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,520
registration storage do an

188
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,460
analysis of all the activities

189
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,340
related in this, all the incidents

190
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,720
that have occurred within your organization and one

191
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,730
other very cool thing, another Miche

192
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,890
speaking briefly and that he has the

193
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,320
capacity to power  share these

194
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,230
threats with others corner me with other

195
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,690
resorts So it would be basically this

196
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,920
here PSOL is I have my mix right then

197
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,790
I have my base, right, there are

198
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,770
several accident information that I

199
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,800
return from feeding you to post

200
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,680
sharing other companies and other

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,279
institutions and

202
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,879
That's it will strengthen a lot because

203
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,310
sometimes the neighbor may have had

204
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,999
an incident, he has already registered it. So he

205
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,360
already shared  so on top of

206
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,870
DaquiDali you can try to step

207
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,519
forward, right from the hearing, possible attack from me

208
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,329
if you're going to be anticipating

209
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,710
basically in the personal trash it's Serv

210
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,730
And then yes, now I'm going to do another one, there

211
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,500
's basically enough on a

212
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,750
use not one  seen from within Mal it was

213
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,740


214
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,760

by some an example if I uninstalled

220
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,019

221
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,620

297
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,190
do the incident notification part

298
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,880
incident analysis support

299
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,340
incident response management to

300
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,730
found skill and the Cool engine here

301
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,880
is that the education and training part

302
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,520
on information security consume

303
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,090
I made an addendum here  right, basically I

304
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,530
did it here that a few hours is Contour, then

305

it causes people in your company, right, it

306
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,940
ended up being funny, for a month, it

307
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,990
's good to talk a little bit about how

308
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,320
to train one here is to join the

309
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,290
two teams in this Jardim and Prontinho right

310
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,650
to talk for another let's go PUC this one

311
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,050


312
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,160
is Vivo right I can for all the layers

313
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,170
of security

314
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,440


315
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,810
how was it these

316
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,440
days, attack that we have a one,

317
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,570
he takes you, Mike, right, he has the ttp

318
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,770
Neck, the technical tactics and procedure in

319
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,220
and here in this case it's so I brought it here

320
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,830
so basically let's not attacking uncle,

321
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,730
right  he gathered all the

322
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,810
information, right, several things died there,

323
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,290
as is the name of the employees,

324
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:39,230
right. Then he goes to the surface

325
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,960
where in the E, it is in molex to take what he

326
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,140
did there, one goes through a step three

327
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,790
here, right, use executed that

328
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,420
malicious file, right  that file to

329
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,680
connect with

330
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,540
the attacker's own silky one, right and Finn here is

331
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,040
there when they can here, right, data in

332
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,860
the execution part was something I

333
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,430
brought here basically with better or in

334
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,370
my technical report po  read Of course that's

335
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,180
