1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,200
and now let's go good morning good afternoon

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,780
good night everyone, ok Thank you, I

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,269
'm watching this lecture, we

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,849
'll talk a little bit about

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,720
security in government.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,419


7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:22,369
micro

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,630
let's go then

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,460
and it's Well basically a little bit about

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,070
me then it's not work like that there

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,350
information security right at Trend

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,590
micro here in Canada also if I'm

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,860
part of the research and security team

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,850
in Cloud and container right and focused

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,370
basically  in the research part of

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,339
security in kubernetes is I just remembered

17
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:53,430
the group of ncrf it's not that it used to

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,850
be called Security now it's called

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,010
follow if tag right the technician or adviser

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,589
trick of the competition claudinete

21
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:05,339
making sure don't consider me second

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,439
Security expert in  Kubernetes, right,

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,110
I'm still learning, right? It's been a

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,670
little over a year now that I've been

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,060
studying this subject, right? So there's still a

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,159
lot to learn and I have a

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,740
blog there, right where I  I try to publish at

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,990
least once a month some articles

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,610
about application

30
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,460
security the cups in the container cloud security,

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,190
it's also the ceg.com card there for

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,610
those who want to access it later

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,250
okay, this is the agenda we have

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,960
for today, right me  I know it's a little

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,800
extensive and let's try to cover it, you

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,920
're not as much as possible, but everything, right

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,230
talk a little bit about just a quick video

38
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,360
about what kubernetes is so I'll

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,830
assume that you have a

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,050
basic initial knowledge of how it works

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,800
cobernet ok this lecture i've already given

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,710
it in the english version also

43
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,040
here i'll send you LED right in the

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,160
previous edition that happened with the right

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,389


46
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,770


47
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,720
it's Bernardes architecture and

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,580
everything else just so we can understand and

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,680
then we'll get into the

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
attack part of what it's like to deal with the sea Framework,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,730
right?

52
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,770
there's

53
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,650
this one now, there's what we're going to

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,690
do, a real attack, right, showing

55
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,590
step by step there is.

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,650


57
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,800


58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,629


59
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,590
to compromise a cluster

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,050
kubernetes foot and then from the

61
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,930
defenses you have for you to protect yourself is it

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,720
for you to prevent

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,760
these attacks from happening in the cluster are

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,030
the classics that you manage that you

65
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,380
have right access

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,310
good so that's it before the  Let's go

67
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,250
to the main topic, right? I wanted to tell

68
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,150
you that last year I created a

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,030
project there at Beach Rugby on this list

70
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,680
that I called the sound that we can have

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,840
fun.

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,150
and I

73
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,230
created one of the security lists there in

74
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,060
kubernet, right to learn internet security,

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,500
why? Because there was a lot of

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,700
material that I was learning by reading and

77
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,310
absorbing knowledge, I just want it

78
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,810
all spread out if I wanted to

79
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,120
find it  something later I couldn't, right

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,710
so I had a treadmill text that I

81
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,600
created here on my machine and I

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,040
said I won't open it then I'll

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,680
share and even folks to be able to

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
contribute also help other people

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,870
So here's the link for you to give

86
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,840
a  take a look, you can go, right, give a

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,050
little star there, you can make a fort and whoever

88
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,490
wants to send a link that is

89
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,390
interesting can send a rich one s

90
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,819
Okay, there's a lot from the

91
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,010
basics, right, to understand a little bit of how

92
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,520
kubernetes works, to the parts

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,010
more advanced vulnerability is

94
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,640
from cvs everything else ok so I think it's very

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,620
interesting to take a look there it is

96
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,320
for you as a good reference and then

97
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,180
we start a little talking about

98
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,419
what is a neomyth and attack Frei

99
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,150
machine a Framework  Master's attack,

100
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,210
right for those who don't know, right, an attack

101
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,030
means opponent Technics 1 Technics in

102
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,660
how north, right, it's tactics and

103
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,590
techniques of opponents and

104
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,660
common knowledge of opponents  it's not what

105
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,490
they use what

106
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,090
opponent attackers who compromise the company

107
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,800
commit to Organizations and everything else

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,690
What are the techniques they use

109
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,690
What are the tactics, right and Mike was

110
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,400
created there based on that is

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,100
the pyramid of  pain right the pyramid the end of

112
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,400
David Bianco right where he says loop type

113
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,639
is Regis and p are easy to change but

114
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,530
when you go to the behavior

115
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,389
When you go to the tactics and

116
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,570
techniques of the attackers it is difficult for

117
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,639
them to change right from an attack  for another

118
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,400
that fast so if you know

119
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,860
enough that they are the way they

120
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,840
are trying to attack you you can

121
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,410
maybe detect and prevent these attacks

122
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,139
right then it is a

123
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,139
global knowledge base of these

124
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,389
attacker tactics real attacks real scenarios

125
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,020
or spill pots  right,

126
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,320
real environment mapping, real scenarios

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,410
that's very important, there's going to be an

128
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,289
attack was killed it's not simulation it

129
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:55,280
's not theory ok it's not it's something

130
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,550
because it's  a case study or a motorcycle,

131
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,470
a threat modeling you did, doesn't

132
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,380
have

133
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,410
the tendency of real attacks, even if

134
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,210
it's at least on a roll on

135
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,310
Harmony net so you have to

136
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,350
demonstrate that the attacker

137
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,050
is actually using this type of tactic.  and

138
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,460
technique, right in external environments and it is

139
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,840
used there as a basis for the

140
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,540
development of threat modeling,

141
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,140
right and methodologies from different sectors,

142
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,320
that is, it can be used for

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,600
defense, right, so I can understand what

144
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,090
attackers are doing in

145
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,720
similar environments  to mine or industries similar

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,140
to that of my company, right? And then I focus more on

147
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,400
that, right, or for attackers to also

148
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,710
understand and try to do a simulation, right,

149
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,320
a simulation attack that they

150
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,740
often call and then it's really simulating

151
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,800
a PT, right, an Advanced persistent freight

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,560
there  to see if your environment is

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,380
prepared and can defend itself and

154
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,390
detect

155
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,600
the type of attacker this type of tractor,

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,720
right? So thats very important. Theres

157
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
more information  tions there on the site you can

158
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
contribute with new techniques with

159
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,760
new tactics you can also send

160
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,330
information that you have seen in your

161
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,090
real environments there can

162
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,370
also be for him to be you can register

163
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,440
new protectors is not new new

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,960
threat agents and also then It is  very

165
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,970
interesting is being adopted there because

166
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,750
it is an open standard, right? So it's being

167
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,190
adopted a lot by the security industry,

168
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,680


169
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,650
okay so here we have a matrix,

170
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,820
right, this is the most current version of

171
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,720
Microsoft, they made the cat Street

172
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,289
Matrix  Neo is the threat matrix of

173
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,419
kubernetes right from Microsoft

174
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,690
Ever folks there they have a previous version that

175
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,550
they released in 2020 April 2020 right And

176
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,530
this is the most current version that was

177
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,389
released right after the release of the

178
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,009
new version of the attack master  just

179
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,720
containers that we'll see on the

180
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,210
next slide, they show you what

181
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,039
changed you what what went in again

182
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,550
and what came out of the previous version

183
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,860
in red and such  which was deprecated

184
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,710
and what are new techniques, so

185
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,650
up there, right, the columns, we have the

186
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,229
tactics and down there,

187
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,779
light gray and dark gray and also red

188
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,690
red and green, we have the techniques

189
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,659
Okay, but

190
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,389
that's not it  it's not an official Miter matrix,

191
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,170
right Méier so there are a lot of people

192
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,209
when they launched the initial version in

193
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,709
April last year, people started

194
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,810
talking, this is not the official matrix

195
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,149
This is Miter's and it's not so much that

196
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,610
they  they didn't call it an attack they didn't call it

197
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,339
Mai ter, so just to keep falling

198
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,459
down it's still an

199
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,889
important reference because the master

200
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,199
himself used this previous version of this

201
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,600
matrix to generate an official matrix,

202
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,069
but it's here for container, ok?

203
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:15,680
it's good to take a look and that link there on the

204
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,709
slide of the most current version in

205
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,329
the most current version of this Matrix and the

206
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,529
one on the slide there Ok okay,

207
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,579
the bank and then we don't

208
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,220
really see the official matrix now, right.

209
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,889
master  attack for containers right The

210
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:41,730
first is the first the first version

211
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,449
was released in February right this year

212
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,129
and and the official version no they will come out

213
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,709
in February to ask for feedback review

214
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,920
for the community and the official version came out

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
now in April at the end of April

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,629
I think Vinte e  9th of April

217
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,769
before the Europa bicono right so this one

218
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,779
is the official matrix so and you can see

219
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,199
the tactics, the techniques and the sub-

220
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,620
technics also go up Technics, right and

221
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,209
we participated in this process, it's a

222
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,949
very interesting process in the creation of

223
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,879
this  The matrix that the people from the sea have

224
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,420
launched is the call, right, the people

225
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,510
from the Comunidade

226
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,630
oi fa Since December of last year, it was

227
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,370
Jane burniske's first post there and

228
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,080
released this This project there into the

229
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,770
sea, so when she made this piece

230
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,830
this blog post last year we

231
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,260
got in touch, right because we already have a

232
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,020
lot of information, right, and

233
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,880


234
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,830
running some of  cobernets, you

235
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,110
understand, they have obtained some

236
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,540
information, we got in touch

237
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,490
with them there with Diane Birds,

238
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,810
the Meier staff and provided all the data

239
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,030


240
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,830


241
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,710
provided all the data,

242
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,450
right, all the references and Evidence, right

243
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,700
from the research that we have done in

244
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,010
the data of ours in the hypothesis, right

245
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,570
then, from the research we did in

246
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,360
docker, in the hypothesis of giving that kubernetes pot

247
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,520
roll, right, so that generated,

248
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,010
I don't care  it was precisely the work of the

249
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,690
community based on the Microsoft matrix,

250
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,020
right. And then also with information

251
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,560
from other companies, that's what they operate

252
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,300
in this container security market. It

253
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,900
generated this Matrix of this Matrix,

254
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,480
we contributed with seven techniques, that

255
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,590
is, 25% of the 28 techniques  25 percent

256
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,590
of the techniques we contributed, and

257
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,130
five of them, it's like an

258
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,370
update because the technique already existed

259
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,390
in the attack for enterprise, but it

260
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,980
didn't  My approach had no

261
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,320
references or evidence to focus on

262
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,950
containers, right, so five techniques and they already

263
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,350
existed, we added, put them in

264
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,540
evidence and proved that this

265
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,190
can also occur in containerized environments,

266
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,710
right and two of them, two

267
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,960
techniques are not totally new, which are

268
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,529
the escape part  in the container is not

269
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,930
the privileged continent to

270
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,060
Deploy a container these things then

271
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,850
two totally new techniques that didn't

272
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,220
exist before in mai have ugly attack

273
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,499
that's very interesting So if you

274
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,300
want to know more there's this link with the

275
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,209
publication is official from

276
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,899
official release in april of dead Frei of this

277
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,110
for container along with version 9 of the

278
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,029
sea and everything else has several updates

279
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:53,279
there that came out recently so if you

280
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
work with this uses it's good to take

281
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,459
a look ok

282
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,230
the beauty here is if it is  the diagram

283
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,189
I made, right, that I modeled is not based

284
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,139
on my knowledge, so at the

285
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,329
end of last year, more or less,

286
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,579
based on what I know.  ments and based on

287
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,740
the Initial matrix there from Microsoft since the

288
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,899
femur attack that had not been launched yet

289
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,829
, you can

290
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,629
see here on the left side of the diagram

291
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,240
that some techniques are not

292
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,290
some tactics excuse Bayern at What's up

293
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,420
as if it were really the process of

294
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,050
an attacker compromising an environment, it

295
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,959
contains carried out, right where your application

296
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,569
is running inside a can, right?

297
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:44,980


298
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,249


299
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,929
whether

300
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,519
the guy can detect that he has a

301
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,290


302
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,440
remote code execution vulnerability, right

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,410
and Morais, the vulnerability, then I got

304
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,110
a Shell inside the can, right inside the

305
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,420
container there that is running

306
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,790
this application, this web application that is

307
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,670
externally exposed in obviously, right.

308
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,800
some

309
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,750
recognitions within the environment to

310
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,840
understand that it is in a

311
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,190
containerized environment it is within a

312
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,290
cluster kubernetes has t  ecnicas have

313
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,120
commands there is a way to do this in

314
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,430
tools that do it for you, right

315
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,630
then it goes and in scale it can stay

316
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,280
there privilege depending

317
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,820
on the tale permissions is how the cluster is configured

318
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,980
the estrous cycle of an old version in

319
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,790
it can do is  Run a

320
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,010
privileged container or do a

321
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,740
skate container technique on And then there are some

322
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,540
other practices that he can do, such as

323
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,810
taking the cholesterol from me,

324
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,500


325
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,420


326
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,450


327
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,200
right?  you can make requests

328
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,350
for the start of killing yourself So, right

329
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,320
I learned instance metadata right there

330
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,650
is so much in WS naeja and in Google right

331
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,810
so you can do that. Sometimes there are

332
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,210
credentials there that you can get that

333
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,710
depending on the permissions of that

334
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,420
credentials you even  can

335
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,750
compromise the entire cloud environment, right?

336
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,790


337
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,520
And then it can, it's secrets of

338
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,630
the kubernetes

339
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,330


340
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,910
service-account of the can, right, it's located in

341
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,310
a specific place and it's hardcoded there in the

342
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,860
Can. He can make a

343
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,920
pass to talk to him on the server and

344
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,990
so on, but in the end, at the end of

345
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,380
all this, it's often the impact  It

346
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,810
can be denial of service it can be

347
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,030
data leakage or data destruction

348
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,390
but almost 90 ninety-five

349
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,740
percent of the time

350
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,390
the impact is resource hijacking, right?

351
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,590


352
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,500
that

353
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,590
environment that was compromised many

354
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,500
times to mine cryptocurrencies, right And then it

355
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,340
's mining a Crypton currency known

356
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,470
among hackers, because it has a little

357
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,800
more

358
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,580
Pri adina, it's a little harder

359
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,580
to track so it's cool it's not

360
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,990
a  cool is the cool currency there that

361
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,540
they use to install so much in the power

362
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,519
that are already running if they

363
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,700
can Or they make depressing of

364
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,089
new privileged power that

365
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,519
already have this binary there to mine

366
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,560
the  cool then infected embedded

367
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,220
there or they install later in that one

368
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,079
that gladly are created in that

369
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,269
they can that cores are created in

370
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,029
some cases depending on the configuration

371
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,800
of your clan be how it is

372
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,300
configured if there is no

373
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,980
security problem there they can

374
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,150
even making the Breakout in the container escape

375
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,859
there leaving the cluster accessing the environment

376
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,890
accessing the host of the kubernetes There be it

377
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,520
another node or a control-plane right And there

378
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,580
it is, I managed to make

379
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,970
Deploy mind of new instances right in the

380
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,610
cloud but it's a  cloud environment, right? And then

381
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,770
these instances are compromised, they

382
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,130
're going to install the miners there in a way

383
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,250
of cryptocurrencies.

384
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,410


385
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,730


386
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,290


387
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,090
It's not the

388
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,190
application, it's very similar to the one we

389
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,559
used here that I'll show you here in

390
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,160
less than 24 hours, right, the attackers had

391
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,380
taken it with  t had committed to

392
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,960
apply

393
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,490
and had not escaped the container had

394
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,169
taken over the environment of a

395
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:15,840
compromised cloud credentials from

396
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,919
the hippies right from WS in the case because it

397
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,880
was an e ks and had created new

398
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,210
gigantic instances not very expensive

399
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,850
to mine cryptocurrency  the luck

400
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,919
that we had monitoring had

401
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,630
detection of this environment because to

402
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,480
quickly see what happened and

403
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,549
then kill these instances that were

404
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,250
created in the signal, the WS account would come

405
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,330
well man, so this is no, it's not a

406
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,970
joke, isn't it  it's not just simulation,

407
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,830
we tested it, a real environment

408
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,260
put it and this application exposed on the

409
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,419
internet was obviously poorly

410
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,049
configured and purpose, but you see that

411
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,659
in less than 24 hours they managed to

412
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,850
commit to the environment,

413
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,670
okay so here's just an example  from a

414
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,710
web application that was one of the

415
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,130


416
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,000


417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,500
ones we used  so

418
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,220
it's a group, right, a group, a

419
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,770
web application and I don't remember used for blogs, then it

420
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,530
's also a competitor of beaches and

421
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,380
João there, right?

422
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,480


423
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,460
old with

424
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,130
this to play with the guys, right, but that

425
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,590
was basically it and this site

426
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,040
has one it runs the double in a version of

427
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,510
if I'm not mistaken 2018 in version 8.5.0

428
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,050
that has remote

429
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,330
command execution vulnerability in command execution

430
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,120
remote from the Algar do coal group

431
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,080
actually drugged drugged 12 right So this

432
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,630
was the web application that we created through the load

433
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,280
balancer in

434
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,830
our clan

435
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,519
and we in Spain also created this internet application

436
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,210


437
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,850
Hi and then when How is access done

438
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,830
Initial, right, how do the guys prove to

439
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,510
compromise And how could you

440
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,250
also compromise this environment,

441
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,430
right in this scenario, we used

442
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,400
this sport from

443
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,130
Andrade's bitgamer locket, right, Félix, right

444
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,600
from cve  -2018 7600 right drupalgeddon2 right

445
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,230
It has a sexual module we don't

446
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,780
meta exploit there are other codes here

447
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,640
you can use what works for

448
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,160
people who were more stable it was this

449
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,040
EcoSport there ok but I also the

450
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,740
transport one also works Maybe

451
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,960
sometimes  sometimes it doesn't work, but it

452
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,020
also works, it's not another

453
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,000
problem here that you have to be

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,730
very careful about is the display of the

455
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,010
dashboard, right now, as people

456
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,140
showed there at the Microsoft headquarters,

457
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,900
it is not installed by default

458
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,120
you only install it there, only if you

459
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,680
want to then you have to

460
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,430
purposely install it

461
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,380
because there are a series of

462
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,480
authentication and authorization problems and such that

463
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,900
can cause errors, in fact it

464
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,000
was through these

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,390
kubernetes dashboard that until then, right  it had

466
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,580
its environment hacked as well as its kubernetes environment

467
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,240
2018. And then, through this, people

468
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,570
began to mine Bitcoin also within

469
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,170
the environment there at Google's gcp, which was

470
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,770
where the thesis to run the  I don't

471
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,630
care today But you

472
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,120
still have what the ticket serves them

473
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,190
here is what the main element is the

474
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,360
main component there of your

475
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,270
control-plane in the one that is exposed,

476
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,600
right to accept the communication there from  use

477
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,490
is alternated and also of other

478
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,290
internal components against the player

479
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,110
is one

480
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,230
And then you have to realize that

481
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,000
in Excel, not in the Government system,

482
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,010
it's managed by the WS, this one by the service

483
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,640
and Point is public by default, right?

484
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,600
by fire ok So, although in the version

485
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,790
in the latest versions of kubernetes

486
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,549
It is not this access that is made for it, it

487
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,190
will be an anonymous access, there is no

488
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,860
permission for practically anything but you can

489
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,540
already see it helps so if you

490
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,610
make a request you will know the  end Point you can

491
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,130
already see that there is a

492
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,830
kubernetes cluster running there, right, so it

493
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,980
's already a leak of information that is

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,750
often unnecessary.

495
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,910


496
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,490
it really looks for

497
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,650
a failure to explore your

498
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,190
clan, right,

499
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,820
and that's the exploration part, right

500
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,970
so if you see there if you can, it

501
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,100
's accessing it is through a simple Field,

502
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,679
for example, accessing your epi the herbs,

503
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,000
right if a system  it's not managed, right.

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,980
Or is it you who made Deploy the mind of

505
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,370
against Play and Burnout if you link

506
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,649
Or they two and everything else it's possible to

507
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,230
do that too it will normally

508
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,559
run on port 6443, right What baby

509
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,409
serves them, right  in managed environments in the

510
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:39,730
case here then KS it will run on

511
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,029
port 443 on so you can know and

512
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:46,679
also by the URL itself, right there from the sks

513
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,559
you already know that there is soul and KS there.  One

514
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,529
more WS.  Against you already know that

515
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:57,049
there is a cluster there and KS running,

516
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,379
okay so it's through that Sport there

517
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,840
in the Algar Dom group, you know the URL

518
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
only the URL of the application you are

519
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,759
running that exploit pointing to the

520
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,379
target URL, you can, it's a Shell

521
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:15,139
inside  of the can within the can of the

522
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:17,960
double, right, it's running, this can is

523
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,980
running on plastic So in this case,

524
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,470
like now okay, you're in and then

525
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,860
you did the exploration, you did the execution, right.

526
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,749


527
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:31,340
a simple

528
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,429
exploration of a common web application right

529
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,320
and now that it will be different that will

530
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,059
change some things some ways to

531
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,879
attack this clan is not have some

532
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,289
tools that you can also

533
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,480
use to know if your clan has

534
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,759
the cancer you are testing  right, with the

535
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,909
authorization, it is vulnerable or not, right,

536
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,399
one of these tools, there is what

537
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:54,799
the club is not before the Secret water,

538
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,059
right, so

539
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,559
I think I'm not mistaken if it was

540
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,529
written in  Python na And then it

541
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:05,249
just makes you pointing out your clan to be

542
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:07,200
no hi piás server there from your cluster

543
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
he to the Ranger club he will look

544
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,409
for these vulnerabilities, right weakness

545
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,840
or configuration failure in your dry clan

546
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,179
Bernardo right then it was developed

547
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,679
to increase  the tension, isn't it? The Incrivel

548
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,139
is right to draw attention and

549
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,600
visibility of security problems

550
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,809
in kubernetes environments, isn't it

551
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,330
currently detecting only 37

552
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,399
vulnerabilities, let's say, or

553
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,590
configuration failures or lack of good

554
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,990
practices in your kubernetes environment. But

555
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,299
you can contribute  because it is an

556
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,940
Open project partner of the water, ok then you

557
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,799
can go there and they are them that if I'm not

558
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,330
mistaken it written on a card or is the

559
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,299
club mind written in Python And then

560
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,080
you can you can submit new

561
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,040
detections, right to the

562
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,580
Okay then and it's free to

563
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,290
use also you don't pay anything so

564
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,930
it's so cool a tool that helps

565
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,610
there for those who really don't understand don't

566
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,050
know yet  It's how a cluster works

567
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,150
classic Bernardes can help try to

568
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,590
detect something for you and

569
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,690
then we fell into

570
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,330
the cluster in we have a Shell

571
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,860
inside a can, right What can

572
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,170
I do there?  I can tell you

573
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,520
what kind of information I can

574
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,430
get, right so one of the things it will

575
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,370
give you is to make sure you were in

576
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,110
the kubernetes environment are the environment variables,

577
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,440
right, everyone can have the

578
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,820
environment variable there, the environment variables

579
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,430
it was the kubernetes washing right so you

580
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,060
have a command there so you can check

581
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,740
which environment variables have the word

582
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,540
kilby right then you will see that there are

583
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,840
several if I'm not mistaken five six

584
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,390
environment variables and it is beyond

585
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,380
pointing there to where the epi is  it

586
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,049
serves it

587
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,029
and everything else so this is already an

588
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,860
indication for you You are in the environment

589
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,590
kubernetes and such and it is not a can

590
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,629
is not a common container docker container

591
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:08,389
just running like this is a can within

592
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:11,570
a cluster or  Another issue there that

593
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,499
you can identify internally

594
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:20,179
in the can is that it is the

595
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,730
service account token of the service-account,

596
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,730
it is placed in every can there and then you

597
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,279
are inside that location. This is the same

598
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,710
place for all powers  right And

599
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,450
it will have a touch in it right A

600
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,559
little jwt and you can use you

601
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,409
can copy this token to pass you

602
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,259
by the black one in this case and

603
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:46,850
then you're making a person

604
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,419
I wasn't even impressed.  you can,

605
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,800
right, to talk to him, right

606
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,370
Ah so here you also have

607
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,010
another tool, you know, the mother Maicon has

608
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,480
milk, you know, it's a

609
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,140
tool of it do it the open partner, right,

610
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,900
it's in the bitgamer You can download it

611
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,940
for her  a tool of

612
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,060
introspection to contain So she she she

613
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,130
you run it inside the container that if

614
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,860
it's not that you're running right And she

615
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,350
'll find out right Kiko that contains

616
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,140
raise me it's being used right And then

617
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,870
what are the features available in

618
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,700
Wed  these are the cards tickets and such What

619
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,160
are the permissions has the profile of being an

620
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,220
accomplice has the app armo enabled these

621
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,410
things so give you a look

622
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,390
at your Contender your environment contains us

623
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,130
then It's very interesting

624
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,060
too

625
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,270
Who is And then to finish the  part of the

626
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,710
attack, right. After exploration,

627
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,820
persistence and also the escalation of

628
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,840
privileges,

629
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,420


630
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,830


631
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,070


632
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,170
that Iza

633
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,150
Valente is the company that develops the

634
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,690
Cilon oscillate is one of the signs there is

635
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,660
widely used and especially in

636
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,430
nude that go to Google kubernetes and

637
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,420
ok, so he posted it there in

638
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,460
2019 a while ago but even today it

639
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,710
works, right  if you have the

640
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,630
necessary permissions obviously you have permission to

641
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,740
cool a privileged can right You

642
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,040
can right make a container an escape

643
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,140
through the testimony of a

644
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,060
privileged can So let's understand a

645
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,070
a little bit, right side,

646
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,670
and I just broke his command right there

647
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,860
like a Geison there because there's

648
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,680
a Jason together in the spec there inside the

649
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,650
green

650
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,620


651
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,340
same line there, so let's go there

652
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,080
that we have here, we don't have a

653
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,220
club even remembering, right? And he takes

654
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,590
a can with a right container, but

655
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,410
the arguments of the overwatch Salina the

656
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,190
overwatch root sideshow is what it does is

657
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,880
this Special Command right, so this

658
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,390
overlords, it overwrites the aspect,

659
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,710
right, with a partial set of values, right like

660
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,960
that I gave it to

661
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,930
him, right then, first we see the

662
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,680
host, little

663
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,080
joke  more fundamental, right,

664
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,320
the isolation of container isolation, right

665
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,960
then, container isolation

666
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,779
lets us see all the processes,

667
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,850
right as if we had it in the HOST.

668
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,690


669
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,250


670
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,950
right mind And then

671
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,340
he will use it inside a container right there

672
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,720
and he will use the M Center command will

673
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,550
run that command there using the image

674
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,920
of the au Pair is whatever he is wearing a

675
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,010
swimsuit Pioneer is downloading from the docker-hub the

676
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,840
last  version in this case here he

677
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,600
didn't specify the version, right but he uses

678
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,070
the command Center, right, to switch

679
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,930
to a different namespace malt, right?

680
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,430


681
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:39,010


682
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,240
request is running in the case, right And then

683
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,760
how we get to you is Karam, right

684
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,710
to be, it's an Altino host name is

685
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,350
Face, right? So we've already started to

686
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,590
complicate things, right.

687
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,810


688
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,540
command the same thing or similar to

689
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,350
you give a host to

690
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:10,370
is right And then make a ch Ruth then Yeah but

691
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,429
that and if it works at the lower level,

692
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:18,830
breaking it is even more the a

693
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,320
lot then the isolation of the Malt

694
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,779
namespace' completely is

695
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:27,889
Who is it And then the privilege is the

696
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:31,489
Security context  related four, right That

697
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:37,909
is, it is necessary to prevent, right here,

698
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:40,669
permissions error of permissions when accessing

699
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:45,559
this proc/a neighborhood DK/right hand so

700
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,590
this was also based on the workshop

701
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,369
of the people here with Nova América, right,

702
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,299
they did the shopping there in 2019

703
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:57,979
this workshop this all the commands

704
00:32:57,979 --> 00:32:59,419
are also available and the explanation of

705
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,580
this communication available on the

706
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,479
citrus site bernardes.com Okay and it's important to

707
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,729
note here but this doesn't work

708
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:11,210
in openshift right and doesn't persist despite

709
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,969
being practically not an

710
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:15,679
enterprise version of cobernets  it has some

711
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,359
feel of the falls some

712
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,940
standard security settings better than

713
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,309
kubernetes so no then it doesn't work

714
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,760
because of can follow

715
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,800
and here in fact it's already being

716
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,030
deprecated

717
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,250


718
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,920
.  attack, we understood

719
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,870
here, we stayed in the part of exposing a

720
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,080
web application. And there is also the

721
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,160
importance of having an application

722
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,680
to  updated right combed a secure code to

723
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,420
work also Secure development

724
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,270
of your application because it's no use

725
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,760
all your steck of your cloud kubernet it's

726
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,090
protected up to date right if your application

727
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,060
is vulnerable then how

728
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,220
can I protect my corner from

729
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,950
attackers, right  No kubernetes is not safe because it's not safe.

730
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,930
So where does it start, right?

731
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,090
And it

732
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,600
's like kubernetes, although cobernets

733
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,210
have improved a lot in recent

734
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,360
versions, it's still not

735
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,190
this default group, it has a series of

736
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,670
configurations, right And you have to do it  of

737
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,980
improvements and good practices to really

738
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,020
make your kubernetes cluster very

739
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,320
robust, right, the first thing is

740
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,870
not to expose the ipe as server

741
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,500
to the internet, and also another thing

742
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,710
is to ensure that the arbac, right, which is the steal

743
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,650
sax control, is enabled, right  which by

744
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,500
default is now ok so just guarantee

745
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,389
that if you have an older cluster,

746
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,179


747
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,370
right?  the one as

748
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,440
I showed before is the result of the

749
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,510
request here, right so if I make a

750
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,960
request, right The port 64430 unmanaged cluster,

751
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,430
right and I do a

752
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,470
peil/version slash then I'll receive there

753
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,099
Probably

754
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,249
an example 403 here in the case that the

755
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:15,979
forbidden But you can see that this format,

756
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,650
this format of the response, this Jason

757
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,979
is particular to a kubernet environment

758
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,529
so even if I get a 403 an error,

759
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:27,979
right, I know there's a kubernetes environment

760
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:30,049
running there so I can make

761
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:32,180
another one that are for  version slash, it's

762
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,069
not normally blocked and I can

763
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:36,769
access even without sitting authenticated there

764
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,569
with the anonymous user, it will

765
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,359
return me to my Clan's version of that

766
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,400
clan if I'm making the

767
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,710
request, right?

768
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,739
I'm authorized to

769
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:53,390
provide it is another very basic thing, right from

770
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,059
Kubernetes, to understand the issue of

771
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:59,509
good practices is the

772
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:02,930


773
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,940
you should know,

774
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,829
but there is also a

775
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:09,589
specific benchmark for cobernets, right? And

776
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:10,109
nowadays there

777
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:14,609
is a specific benchmark for QI

778
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,890
and what is this benchmark, right?

779
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,160


780
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,029


781
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:25,880
recommended security settings

782
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,400
for a cluster in a kubernetes cluster

783
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,799
right it is not to have the minimum

784
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:35,279
possible security right so it has a series

785
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,019
of security checks and in this case

786
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,970
in the latest versions more than 120

787
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,450
security checks

788
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,940
and it was developed by none other

789
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,420
then imachine they Race and several

790
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,420
others are against contributors right

791
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,910
now and Marconi nowadays works in the

792
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,349
water.

793
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,930


794
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,119


795
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,579


796
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,650
isovalerate, right in the

797
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,260
past, it was also possible to get it

798
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,320
right so it is a PDF document,

799
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,410
right, it has a lot of pages so it

800
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,030
can scare a little for anyone  never

801
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,970
dealt with these benchmarks But the

802
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,930
important thing is that it shows you what the

803
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,140
security recommendation is, it shows

804
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,990
you how to check in your clan to be which

805
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,730
specific command for you to check

806
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,849
in yours.

807
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,160
is

808
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,680
applied, right, the expected result and I

809
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,390
don't expect if it doesn't

810
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,770
match the expected result, it will be

811
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,460
applied there, then it's not here.

812
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,830


813
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,170


814
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,660
That's

815
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,030
why the document is quite extensive Okay, but

816
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,780
I don't think that's how it is, it's interesting give it

817
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,700
a read take a look at it,

818
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,680
obviously if you don't have time, you do

819
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,710
n't want to look.

820
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,330


821
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,089
no, then you have two options or you

822
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:07,950
run the commands each one

823
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,780
manually there from the Marcos environment, don't

824
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,609
break it, hardly anyone will do

825
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:14,359
that or you use this other tool, it

826
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,910
's this tool too  of Secret water

827
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,910
was developed in a goal, which is the PIB

828
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,920
tooth so as I said before, the

829
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,020
screeching one developed in Python and

830
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,020
this coexistence disclosed it will check

831
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,880
if your cluster is ok, it was, right, it was

832
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,160
deplorable we were implanted there from

833
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,900
safely achieving some standards

834
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,349
right then not valid valid all your

835
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,440
clan to be with

836
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,900
and with good practices there from CS

837
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,599
kubernetes benchmark a certain touch there's an

838
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,880
example here of the result right from the club

839
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,260
mind I ran the club mind in my

840
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,800
cluster there it was  misconfigured, right And

841
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,079
then he'll tell you here, look at this

842
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,420
here failed he's got each item That's

843
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,520
it you can be this number Zinho you

844
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,980
can reference it in the document right,

845
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,200
too good and he'll say you have to

846
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,329
guarantee that you  said, look at this here

847
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:11,859
you have a guarantee you're giving an oil and

848
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:14,440
here, so each one does it has

849
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,480
it arrives at the configuration of the master

850
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,700
node on the control-plane already with

851
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,069
the EPI settings, it serves them in the

852
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,800
nude motors of Steel Bla  ck Style CD he does a

853
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,530
lot of checks there for you in

854
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,390
your cloister so if you really are

855
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,059
If you need it, just do a

856
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,789
quick check and have an overview of

857
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,369
how your security status is

858
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:40,140
what you kubernetes think the

859
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,059
club  mind helps a lot and does a

860
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,369
quick job there so you can have an

861
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:49,380
overview for me then you can go

862
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,990
there and start applying the benchmark recommendations,

863
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,349
right, to improve

864
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,560
your closet's benchmark, right

865
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,240
And besides, right, besides protecting the

866
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,010
settings  security of your clan

867
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,500
is a very important thing, right and

868
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,050
now even more important with the

869
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,820
increase of these supply chain attacks

870
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,930
in solarwinds codecov among others

871
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,880
that happened recently, right It's you

872
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,860
protecting the images that will enter

873
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,390
your environment that will enter  in your clan

874
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,040
you kubernetes, right, so it's important to

875
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,820
run, in this case, an

876
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,940
image scanner, right, to see if your

877
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,630
image is not your container, doesn't

878
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,120
have a vulner  publicly

879
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,300
known abilities right if you do

880
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,490
n't have up-to-date libraries if you don't have any kind of

881
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,710
Mauer if you don't have any kind of

882
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,620
hardcoded credentials right then most

883
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,250
of these tools do it

884
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,110
for you right then you have a Claire

885
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,480
you have a snick you  have a close call they have

886
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,570
Smart Shake

887
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,490
and nowadays you also have Dr

888
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,710
Serkan which is a command now native to the

889
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,840
Doc here is nothing more than the

890
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,830
sneaker sneaker behind it running there

891
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,470
in the mechanical Dok you can also run it's

892
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,830
this Scan  directly on the

893
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,650
command line there, so practically

894
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,560
all this software there they have is a

895
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,970
version one, think about it, a

896
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,310
free version or a trailer or something

897
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,200
like that that you can use to test, okay

898
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,080
so that's important, right And then it goes

899
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,960
without saying  talking about the image is also

900
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,160
important that you use a record and it

901
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,400
doesn't contain radio and private, right, and you won't

902
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,290
find your images directly from the

903
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,520
docker-hub, right, because if you're not the

904
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,870
first question, it's  that someone can

905
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,440
compromise Those images despite

906
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,540
having the official images there and everything else

907
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,580
there can still be compromised, nobody guarantees

908
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580


909
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,480
good so and you have a

910
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,970
private repository where you can isolate Those

911
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,860
images and use only the specific version of the

912
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,620
image that you have  it's necessary, right, so this is

913
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,190
also important.

914
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,010
Hi, what about that? And then we're

915
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,460
going to talk about the clan being as a

916
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,220
whole

917
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,280


918
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,080
.  Van time don't be

919
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,450
after I do the depressing of my

920
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,900
image in my cluster

921
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,660
is what I can how can I protect it

922
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,120
and I still have a

923
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,550


924
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,600
middle ground there  very

925
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,620
difficult, many people think it's unnecessary,

926
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,560
right There's a protection tool from a

927
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,080
delay protection team in the environment

928
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,500
with Centralized, right, but we've

929
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,520
seen that more and more attackers have

930
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,270
made use of images and p images  official

931
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,180
docker-hub opulars and everything

932
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,020
else to

933
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,410
reduce puberty to compromise the environment,

934
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,810
so here's Falco, it's a project

935
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,620
too. Someone just donated to cnsf by

936
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,060
the company.

937
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,840
of container security,

938
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,360
right, the falcon, it does this type

939
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,000
of protection, right there are some others like

940
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,390
Tracy and some others there, but it's Falco

941
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,900
It has become the standard tool for

942
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,110
this

943
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,820
and it takes the step of sescols

944
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,430
than gasoline Max at  one time is not

945
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:50,910
a runtime, right, emphasizing a

946
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,700
technology that is relatively new and in

947
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,820
the security world, but it is being

948
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,310
used a lot by

949
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:03,020
container companies, which is ebpf.

950
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,360


951
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,700
the scope of the lecture

952
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,550
but whoever wants to know more send me

953
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,870
a message ok I'll pass

954
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,660
some references ok he

955
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,960
detects right He's a basically an

956
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,990
indian squid in india some rules you

957
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,270
create the r  egra for him it may already come

958
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,850
with some rules defined by default

959
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,330
but it detects unexpected behavior

960
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,100
in your clan if years I

961
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,260
container like someone running a best

962
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,710
there installing SSH and such and then it generates

963
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,090
alerts based on the

964
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,660
threats Anderson right So that's him  using

965
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,200
this and this

966
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,080
rules engine isn't that easy to make new

967
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,600
rules it's basically files and it's by hand, right

968
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,670
And you can create your own rules

969
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,650
if you can use the default

970
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,250
Falcon rules there

971
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,380
create a custom protection of your

972
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,050
environment, right then it detects

973
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,480
any type of execution, too, I think

974
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,280
it does, if I'm not mistaken, a little bit of

975
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,340
the traditional Triple whether

976
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,590
Tec's drift wants to know what has changed, right

977
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,540
From the moment that your container

978
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,620
it was deplored in the kubernetes plan,

979
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,260
it's something changed, if

980
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,840
a process was installed in the started a new process,

981
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,240
installed a new package and it makes

982
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,130
this technical drift, it's basically a

983
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,800
G  IF, right, a gif of when the container was

984
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,930
deplored and the current status of the container

985
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,580
to find out if anything has changed, right,

986
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,570
and

987
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,760


988
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,670


989
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,370
it's great  for those who don't understand

990
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,820
well about kubernetes, pod is an

991
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,820
encapsulation of containers, right?

992
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,730


993
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,660


994
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,740


995
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,180


996
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,830
of

997
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,710
clearly you can Okay but the same way

998
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,140
with containers right cans you have

999
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,650
to worry about is limiting the

1000
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,960
resources in this podium in CPU and

1001
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,390
memory and then there's an object inside

1002
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,980
kubernetes you can use here it

1003
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,690
calls resources back  And you define

1004
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,010
how much you said For now from memory

1005
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,230
those cans there that you want will go

1006
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,140
will have will receive, right Another

1007
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,560
important thing is bone

1008
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,620
And yesterday teach the security context,

1009
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,000
right you can too  apply your

1010
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,430
cans And there are some directives here

1011
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,430
such as the halal privilege

1012
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,130
escalation of the only Road rail

1013
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,560
System and non-routine hours So here's

1014
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,740
a recommendation of what values they

1015
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,140
should have, right there, the escalation privilege

1016
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,760
to false right obviously to  video rid

1017
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,680
of root file System for you right that's

1018
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,320
your mistake Disguise is just live online

1019
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,170
right Like us don't fight too Scepter That

1020
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,610
is, you're not going to give your container

1021
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,100
as a routine so it's not

1022
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,970
ideal for you to do this

1023
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,220
this is  another issue that you can

1024
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,320
also improve the

1025
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,690
protection of your powers even more, right And then

1026
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,000
of your containers is to

1027
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,020
apply is these security mechanisms

1028
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,780
of the Linux Kernel in your environment

1029
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,730
in your ports, right then in these

1030
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,410
mechanisms we will mention three  here

1031
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,940
obviously I'm not going to go into details

1032
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,520
about how each one of them are and

1033
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,630
how it works because there won't be

1034
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,420
time, ok, but basically we have the

1035
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,440
set comp, right?  tra right the six

1036
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,500
schools of a certain process is you have

1037
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,740
an app arma right or epp armo right it

1038
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,340
uses profiles there is no need

1039
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,800
for a program to restrict the capabilities right

1040
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,470
of individual programs

1041
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,800
me

1042
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,030
something like that I don't remember the names

1043
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,970
But you can limit this through ep

1044
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,980
to selinux, right that applies security laws

1045
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,950


1046
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,180
and it's to the objects of evaluation, right, all

1047
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,550
interactions relevant to security

1048
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,500
through a policy in the

1049
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:33,130
security policy are  these these these

1050
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,710
security sites in your classic

1051
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,040
Bernardes are not activated by default

1052
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,690
even your docker container of some

1053
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,329
of these activated children is the profile, right,

1054
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:47,890
it's present if I'm not mistaken

1055
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,900
Peppa set the default kubernetes doesn't

1056
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,109
inherit these settings  ok then

1057
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:57,670
you have to apply it again

1058
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,220
manually there in your file and it's hand

1059
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,750
in your can before doing the Deploy

1060
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,760
mind of it ok ok

1061
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,890
Hi and then for us to go practically

1062
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,630
fi  finalize here we are already reaching the

1063
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,390
end right we had here

1064
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:15,770
the can City Police is now PSP right

1065
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,810
they were deprecated there in the latest

1066
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,870
version of kubernetes it's in the version call

1067
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:25,010
me mistaken in 121 right and he they were she

1068
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,340
was basically a Security  context,

1069
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,760
you could apply to several

1070
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,130
for your entire cluster practically,

1071
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,240
but it never entered the

1072
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,280
frosted version of kubernetes in General

1073
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,500
availability, right, it always had some

1074
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,330
problems that you difficult to implement,

1075
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:48,860
right? And then people have other

1076
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,360
tools you can  use in place

1077
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,450
of Cystitis, if there is a new one, it is not

1078
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,040
a new one, it may be a film that is being

1079
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,990
worked on there by the

1080
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,520
security and authentication team of

1081
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,490
Kubernetes screen to generate to replace

1082
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,370
this one can follow that it will come out there I

1083
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:04,770
think not

1084
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,840
and it is  here are some two other

1085
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,940
Kubernetes versions for 2011 end of next year

1086
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,000
ok, this is the end of next year

1087
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
half during we were right so

1088
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,410
the alternatives that we  there's here

1089
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,060
for Maybe that today policy, right to

1090
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,650
replace it, it's the first, just to

1091
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,540
talk before entering these tools,

1092
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,850
right, maybe you choose it if it's an

1093
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,950
admitted control, it needs an

1094
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,290
admits control to work, right.

1095
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,690
it's an admission control admits the

1096
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,550
control kubernetes just what

1097
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,020
the name says is an admission control,

1098
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,620
right, it's like it was, right, not in the

1099
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,820
case that your clan's doorman, right?

1100
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,400


1101
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,080
there in your suna clan you want to

1102
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,330
run container X He will see if the

1103
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,450
container meets the

1104
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,670
minimum security requirements and will make a badge

1105
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,940
there to leave it, right?

1106
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,500


1107
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,750
a tool

1108
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,360
that by its name is the gate Keeper, right the

1109
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,240
other one here is the pen police people and the

1110
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,580
great one here because it's a version of

1111
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,190
oops for kubernetes, right It's a tool

1112
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,630
that works as it manages and controls

1113
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,070
and you can define policies  right,

1114
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,360
through a specific language

1115
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,410
they have, which is a language called

1116
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,800
called, right, it's not the one in Portuguese, it's ugly,

1117
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,470
the name is downloaded. But it's in English, it's

1118
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:32,770
Igor so you can create the policies,

1119
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,980
right, for your clan

1120
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,780
what can enter or not which images can

1121
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,490
enter or without image has a

1122
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,050
critical vulnerability there cannot

1123
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,060
enter my clan if the image

1124
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,950
was not scanned by my

1125
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,480
Scan tool it cannot enter my clan if

1126
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,250
you And then I can  create

1127
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,020
political deficiencies as it also comes with some

1128
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,080
standard policies, right there is also

1129
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,250
winter melka winter right that means

1130
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,710
government right, governing is not a management

1131
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,740
not in the case of governing in case of

1132
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,060
maintaining order there, then, it is a

1133
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,760
word in English

1134
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,930
and  the word kubernetes, right, so it's the

1135
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,410
main difference from winter to

1136
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,690
oops, he doesn't have a

1137
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,540
specific language, right as a friend, he uses his

1138
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,750
own imo, right, it's already standard there for

1139
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,730
kubernetes to generate the  your policies

1140
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,770
for the Cold police, right, a diesel,

1141
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,960
what can or what cannot enter my

1142
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,590
cluster, right, in my kubernetes course, okay?

1143
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:39,050


1144
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,510


1145
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,040


1146
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,680
it can only be like you, right, so

1147
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,430
here's the personal link of the do if said

1148
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,800
thirsty of the sig of of kubernetes, right?

1149
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,260


1150
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,910


1151
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,500


1152
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,260


1153
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,300
how will the model be and

1154
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,950
now they will deploy, right now will

1155
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,770
write the code

1156
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,990
and this one can be sad then it should

1157
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,360
still maybe come in this next version

1158
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,480
or the other one ok

1159
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,740
hum hum eh don't also have the Malbec

1160
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,320
World Day sax control  Mac allows you to

1161
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,930
configure is who can access what in

1162
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,720
your clan if not basically it's

1163
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,730
like you have in most

1164
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,190
web applications right You have a profile

1165
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,200
access control based on profile right you have your

1166
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,050
eyes  common s you have manager you

1167
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,780
have me, right And there you go you

1168
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,600
could create several profiles right, arbac,

1169
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,210
basically, it is also

1170
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,920
enabled by fire in the latest

1171
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,570
versions of the ruler You can see

1172
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,720
this through Flag's right

1173
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,590
autorization code are Back in your ibps it works, right, and it

1174
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,119
basically has four different objects,

1175
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:57,060
right Carol holding trust

1176
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,940
holding ebx holding it's not that it

1177
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,280
doesn't actually change much, right so if we

1178
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,410
look here in this other diagram, the

1179
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,880
wolf is setting the permissions  but

1180
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,830
setting permissions at the namespace level

1181
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,490
didn't even undone if it didn't fit

1182
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,950
and it's more than just a directory

1183
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,260
a folder where you can run a

1184
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,450
project is a logical separation, right And then

1185
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,340
there's no security restriction,

1186
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,900
there's no protection  in

1187
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,030
relation to this, right and the freebie

1188
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:30,010
is basically saying it makes the junction, it

1189
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,619
's the users who want to have that

1190
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:35,200
permission with the specific permission, right,

1191
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,330
so he gives it right Gives permission to

1192
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,960
one or  more users, right, it's that

1193
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,810
permission lasted, right? And then there's the

1194
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,140
cluster or right and the cluster, the toast, which is

1195
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,450
the same thing, but they act at the

1196
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,820
highest permission level, reaching the

1197
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,490
cluster level, right, and not just at

1198
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,160
their namespace level  are more

1199
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,640
permissive and

1200
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,500
I'm going to run a little bit here because

1201
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,000
we're already finishing up,

1202
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,180
time is running out or decide what is the location is a

1203
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,819
stored data, isn't it a storage location

1204
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:15,349
of the settings of Your

1205
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,109
main cluster there in oxide Obviously you

1206
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:20,089
can change  if you want but the default

1207
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:22,640
is it, right, practically all the objects

1208
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,730
of your classic Are saved here, right, and

1209
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,470
recently we looked at

1210
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,170
her show, right, our tool there to find

1211
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,880
devices posted on the internet had

1212
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,119
more than 2,600, it is said, right on the door  at

1213
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,519
least decide that it's the standard exposed

1214
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:39,589
there on the internet so be careful

1215
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:41,390
not to expose that the É I decided

1216
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,490
also has an apex you committed to

1217
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,470
decide it's the same thing if you have to

1218
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,800
like me there j  it was

1219
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,010
ok, so two basic things to decide

1220
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,070
are the encryption in transit, it

1221
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,190
is already active by default and the encryption is to

1222
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,860
take but at rest which is not done

1223
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,660
by default Or whatever is stored

1224
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,210
in your is to decide is stored in  a

1225
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,660
plain text right, even your

1226
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,000
Hertz Club Secrets here at most are in

1227
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,750
base64 right so if you want Right

1228
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,940
encrypt this data in your DIY

1229
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,370
You need this object then create an

1230
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,890
object in Krypton configuration and

1231
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,320
tell it what  that it will be

1232
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,400
encrypted inside yours, it's up to you, ok

1233
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,310
And there's also another protection, right, the

1234
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,190
Network policy for those who don't know

1235
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,130
kubernetes by default, right? It's a

1236
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,830
flat network on the Flash network where when all

1237
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,690
Ports can talk to any other

1238
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,300
you can of your clan if also or that is not

1239
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,820
it for security it is absurd, right

1240
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,780
then, you

1241
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,050
are very careful, right, to create a

1242
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,390
network policy, a Network policy

1243
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,250
for your clan if you do the

1244
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,220
network segregation within the  your own clan,

1245
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,890
right? So here like ah, the front-end can

1246
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,650
talk to the

1247
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,570


1248
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,250


1249
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,650


1250
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,140
database  being able to access the pots of which

1251
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,480
there are namespacing is the PIB system.net it's

1252
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,940
not even made me main where you run

1253
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,070
the powers of your control-plane, right then

1254
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,910
you don't want that to happen

1255
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,430
ok then the tool there from the Network

1256
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,799
policy editor of the eyelash on  Iza

1257
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:31,270
Valente staff asked for help you to

1258
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,530
visualize What are your

1259
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,299
network policies What are the accesses there very

1260
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:36,770
interesting I'll leave this link there

1261
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,930
for you and last and not

1262
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,690
least have the audit logs right the audit logs right.

1263
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,510
they are not active

1264
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,819
by default either, you have to activate them, it is

1265
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:48,950
highly recommended that you activate

1266
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,319
these audit logs not only for security

1267
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,319
but also for pocket full, right, to

1268
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,420
detect blog problems there in your

1269
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,079
clan, right?  r they basically

1270
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,789
minimally you only need one is

1271
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:05,510
the file path Where you will

1272
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,630
save the log file and the policy right

1273
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,309
What are you going to use how are you

1274
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:12,109
going to save those logs how soon

1275
00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:14,450
will you save right obviously  there are other

1276
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,839
settings there you can put the

1277
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,549
rotational logo and file size

1278
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:21,380
you will send the log to another place

1279
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,920
but minimally

1280
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,650
the two things here you need, right And

1281
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,450
then you can define these two

1282
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,460
things I don't know what BP serve them in

1283
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,890
configuration of your asanga clip, right in the

1284
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,230
case of sks right and other managed environments, it

1285
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,540
's basically a button there

1286
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,089
that you activate and then the Clóvis eyes it

1287
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:43,920
starts saving and goes to Cláudio

1288
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,369
lote right you can see the audit logs

1289
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:49,290
of your station

1290
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,830
there.  to finish right, not least,

1291
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,990
but always remember the basics

1292
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,210
right, do the basics first,

1293
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,580
nothing more than before doing these

1294
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,280
more advanced things I would, which is to

1295
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,100
keep your cluster up to date, right  Give

1296
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,440
preference to the latest version we know

1297
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,290
that in managed environments the version

1298
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:13,590
is a little older but try to

1299
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,120
keep the most current version available

1300
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,600
through your Cloud pro, you will read it, don't

1301
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,580
use sewing me for

1302
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,250
day-to-day tasks, right?  either use the

1303
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,530
cancel patio from me as if you were a root, right

1304
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,530
if you can use managed services such

1305
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,960
as IQ aksks not and

1306
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,420
took a look at the CS documents

1307
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,760
that Bernardes benchmark for more good

1308
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,490
security practices ok guys, well

1309
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,930
I think that's it  then I hope you

1310
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,540
enjoyed the lecture and I'll

1311
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,520
be available there I don't know in the chat

1312
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,300
or elsewhere for a question,

1313
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:54,960
thank you very much and until the next one, it's worth it.
