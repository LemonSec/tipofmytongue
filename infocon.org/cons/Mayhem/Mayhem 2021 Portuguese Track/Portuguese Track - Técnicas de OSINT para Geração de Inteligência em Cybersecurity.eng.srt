00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,359
Hi, good afternoon everyone, I would like to

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,130
introduce myself. My name is Wagner Moraes I

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,610
work at a Telecom company and in

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,090
Brazil I have already lectured in some

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,910
security events. I know a lot of people in

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,359
the security area too and my hobby

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,119
is information security. I also like

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,150
to play STF  in my spare time I

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,369
like to do everything related to

10
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,040
security, I live this, right, and I came with

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,450
this lecture and talk a little bit about

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,360
techniques to help generate

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,660
intelligence, which is a very relevant topic, and

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,450
we've been growing a lot and

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,270
also a  growth of new threats

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,990
new organized crime groups And this is

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,650
a technique that companies have been

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,070
acquiring products and platforms every month

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,640
is how to anticipate the threats, right? So

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,400
if I know what the enemy is

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,060
intending to do, it's easier to know

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,910
how to defend yourself  I try to predict that

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,290
they are actually using a new blouse,

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,950
a vulnerability that is already on the

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,600
market and then I haven't updated my

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,450
system so Par  if it doesn't happen, it doesn't even

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,520
happen Owner who's going, right, it's not clear

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,580
and we knew about the update failure

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,680
there was a while and we ended up

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,050
updating it And then it ended up infecting

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,180
thousands of computers, right so in the

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,490
company, be a threat, you can try to

33
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,520
predict what you can  happen and you

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,830
mitigate this in your company, right, so

35
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,020
let's talk a little bit about it,

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,100
I hope you like

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,369


38
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,720


39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,360


40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,899
it  that would be the know

41
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,119
mind, right, it would be the collection of data

42
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,920
through different information points

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,380
to generate intelligent, right then,

44
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,679
we know how to enter this, we

45
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,170
can collect information from several

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,620
different means, not only technological,

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,690
we can complete information from the

48
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,200
lever  gel indicates geolocation

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,220
so we know that

50
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,910
we have a lot of information and we

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,600
generate this information and extract what is

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,910
necessary  io for our company in

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,080
their cooperation, our day-to-day, right.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
Open source intelligence is an open-source

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,130
intelligence,

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,049
right?

57
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,780


58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,080


59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,330
and

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,230
freely, it's just a matter of having some

61
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,890
time to research and understand the forms of

62
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,000
research. There is a patient framework

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,280
that I can even demonstrate here that has a

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,770
lot of information, right and I'll quickly

65
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,310
show here an accident framework

66
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,380
the work

67
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,930


68
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,450


69
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,160
here  buses have the o Framework and it

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,700
has several categories, right so if I

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,190
want to do a search for a user

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,069
name I can come here and there are some

73
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,630
name search engines, right name check

74
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,970
to get names and then I have part of

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,930
the social network.  I have part of PE so I

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,569
have n options the idea here is just a

77
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,080
vision, right Where can I ask for

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,290
information and then Let's say we have

79
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,040
a threat that is not known And then I

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,099
try  identify it was some mail

81
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,709
I got some audio on my Faro I got

82
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,890
some spam in the email And then I want to

83
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,530
identify it

84
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,150
so I can try to make some

85
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,149
songs, right And then there are several options here

86
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,680
that I can be using to  to be able to

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,850
make this song to try to

88
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,459
identify

89
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,669
and to try to understand to see if this

90
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,860
Fishing is directed to me right

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,720
because nowadays there is a lot of

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,190
campaign directed to go to this

93
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,349
company right so we have to

94
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,750
be careful the idea of the Framework is it

95
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,030
it is subdivided into several categories and

96
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,419
you end up researching in them even some

97
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,069
things here that are not working

98
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,639
anymore but it is very useful for the day-to-day right

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
In the Initial Search right

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,540
Hi and then where to start is

101
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,390
what I thought I was talking about here, right  And then,

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,670
as it says here on the slide Our one of the

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,900
most difficult things to start the

104
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,310
program for companies requiring

105
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,960
threats and decide where to start

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,720


107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,550
the collection  I'm going to start what I

108
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,670
do I'm paying for I want to start

109
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,290
this now what I do I get I

110
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,980
'll get feed on the internet I'll see

111
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,430
my Faro's signature, understand And that's

112
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,140
a question here, everyone asks, right

113
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,980
So there's always a different approach

114
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,650
to this theme and then they

115
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,720
started but I think that you have a well-

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,340
structured one, yours is

117
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,780
the party hard your company's security

118
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,660
your processes And then we know

119
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,550
that there is a lot of interest in it.  It's a

120
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,850
strategic plan of the company, she likes

121
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,880
that if you're consulted, various sectors

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,310
will consult this threat sector

123
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,470
there, you'll try to sift the

124
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,050
threats,

125
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,520


126
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,030
right?  So

127
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,620
you'll see that it's not that complicated here,

128
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,840
so an idea after

129
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,590
the internal teeth started is we

130
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,930
start, we can start looking

131
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,610
for what happened with an internal incident,

132
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,440
right then I'll take it  on my own

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
in Flaiane instead of looking out for

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,340
what I'm going to look for I see

135
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,260
my childhood what I'm going to

136
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,000
what I have there of incident trying to

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,350
catch the incidents I've had and have

138
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,450
them stay there I  I had a

139
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,360
commitment I didn't have a commitment

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,780
a system is if I've already had

141
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,250
an attempt to hit my Firewall hard on

142
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,830
an email account and then I

143
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,420
try to identify who it is to try to

144
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,320
get at least close Who went to

145
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,870
us, we try to disguise  a threat, right And

146
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,730
then, as a slide says, data these

147
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,210
internal teeth, right, the hardest part

148
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,380
of Threat Intelligence is not going to

149
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,060
collect data, it's the easy

150
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,580
part, the hard part is deciding which data is

151
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,450
worth collecting And then you can take care of it so

152
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,400
we can take  a platform and

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,140
incident response in the example here, what makes you

154
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,840
angry is that it is a sweating platform that

155
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,120
you can integrate with some

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,550
tools and then you can respond to

157
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,370
an accident within the platform, right.

158
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,720
as he was saying nothing is worse than

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,150
invasive using the same resource

160
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,580
twice so when you know

161
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,200
Google Minnie is used how you two

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,940
continue watch yourself domain

163
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,360
Actually he's talking here that he sees them

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,849
The Intruder He makes the mistake more  once,

165
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,460
right, so it goes there, it has to search

166
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,800
your network, it tries to make an intrusion

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,409
Then it goes there again, you understand And then it

168
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,030
's nice for you to map this

169
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,580
invader there, try to sit down, I know it's

170
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,310
complicated, it's a lot of blogs in Faro, but then

171
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,969
You try to get the list sometimes

172
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,409
I have a no Hit at dawn on

173
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,409
my IP And why is it giving no

174
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,419
Hit trying to scan and I try to

175
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,509
understand who might be doing I

176
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,669
know it's hard to have I can mask

177
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,479
the  IP I can say the IP but someone always

178
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,340
leaves a trace, right There's a

179
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,349
cool tool here called multiverse that

180
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,590
I use a lot I'll show

181
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,819
you here that you can make

182
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,969
this song

183
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,429
and it's good I had a tool

184
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,958
free so I can get an IP here

185
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,959
I will get an IP an example that I

186
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
say IP that is hitting my network

187
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,579
I can get an IP here let me see

188
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,189
if I have one there is an example to see

189
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,660
here xô analyze it

190
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,990
I will see  here 3 analysis

191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,120
and he didn't bring me anything let me get

192
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,160
another one came here that I know has

193
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,760
a bad reputation is

194
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,540
who is here this perceiver

195
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,649
an example this foot is cool from the

196
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,930
multiverse he shows here the country

197
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,200
will be malicious the type of lists  that it has

198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,060
already been blocked to be able to

199
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,310
identify you what he does what he

200
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,750
does, right And then he shows us, we pass

201
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,089
information he is related to pt 41

202
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,399
there in front he arrived a little while ago,

203
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
PT, presenting how bad he is And then here

204
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,260
there is a team line of his operation so

205
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,880
it started on March 27th and stopped on the

206
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,140
29th for two days there is a case here that

207
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,330
we have here it started from a year ago it started

208
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,380
in 2019 it was back in 2021 so it's cool

209
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,050
that you can check it out here it is  very

210
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,459
fast is this re  Putting is who it can be

211
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,700
then you start to filter this

212
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,470
information, you can filter it

213
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,630
so it's pretty cool you start

214
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,660
here

215
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,220
also our blog those who are

216
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,560
richer there in your rules you have a if

217
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,629
in if you have any rules  that you

218
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,850
got the reader here from Force

219
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,060
some kind of attack, you understand, so this

220
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,610
idea started to have a tool to

221
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,699
get you started, I'm going to come back here on the

222
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,860
slide and Ron can really cool the idea of

223
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,269
a hypothesis that the idea of you

224
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,949
letting that  tell me to let the crook

225
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,720
enter my network right to collect

226
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,060
information right there are

227
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,329
cool tools right here in the example there is

228
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:03,310
Sept mhn's Security box and I'm going to demonstrate two

229
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,050
tools here

230
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,399
one is Roney baby this

231
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,920
tool is a free tool but it She  it

232
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,399
gives you a view of what happens with your uncle

233
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,589
Roni, you register there on the

234
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,709
platform and you upload a machine with

235
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,649
us and then you buy, I managed to get

236
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,060
metrics correlated to your machine

237
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,570
right And of course there are paid versions there that

238
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,100
you can get more and more

239
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,070
information right but it's paid right so it's

240
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,670
another cool tool I think it's

241
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,410
another tool which is the modern home

242
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,620
Network I went up an environment here just to

243
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,040
show it here at the event So  I just have

244
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,990
to explain to you it is

245
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,860
Andthere

246
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,829
and I have here is no real environment

247
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,339
even I climbed this machine last night

248
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,930
at dawn this this machine what

249
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,600
this Modern Roney patchwork is a

250
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,820
this one is a server and I have a

251
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,560
machine  by Roni pot I raised here at

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,819
WS Brazil

253
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,309
Hi and then you can see that I raised the

254
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,319
machine doesn't even have 24 hours of

255
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,189
machine that it already sent attacks to it

256
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:29,469
so then I can see it here

257
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,470
and I had 37,000 attacks in less than  24

258
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,830
hours without a doubt nowadays so

259
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,690
even under a machine it already goes up being

260
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,000
attacked it is very, very crazy understand

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,560
why we can do more but imagine

262
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,510
a service of our critic and we go up

263
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,100
a service of our critics and will

264
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,320
always be indemnified for the good things.

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,370
market tactics you will be hacked fact this

266
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,140
machine here has already been hacked already it's hacked already

267
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,350
It took a short time for them to hack in

268
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,769
So this modern owner Network is a

269
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,630
cool function that I can extract

270
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,760
here who were the main SP companies

271
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,570
here in India  1,300 attacks

272
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,440
which were the most accessed ports

273
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,010
Hi and what kind of vain hypothesis I used

274
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,780
these four types of João hypothesis each

275
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,640
one sponge something right a

276
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,840
fancy story one exploits a particular application flaw,

277
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,190
right so I can see

278
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,950
the stubborn ones here  that the

279
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,130
machine was actually used here signature that

280
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,410
was used from the north, right And then I

281
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,140
can understand what might

282
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,490
be happening what

283
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,620
Aunt is suffering in a little while right. Cool here, I

284
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,910
can

285
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,550
see which users they have  used

286
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,920
to access the machine it's me as

287
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,090
usual Faro mikrotik user is the

288
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,970
types of passwords that were used a two

289
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,600
three test of me and here it's cool that

290
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,250
you can map  air that process zips And

291
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,320
then you imagine here in the scenario of 3D

292
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,910
threat I want to start I can also

293
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,530
talk about it I in my

294
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,140
infrastructure not configured in a dmz

295
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,500
I upload a structure like this I put

296
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,530
a machine in this common pot then I do

297
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,930
more work  cute, right, it sets up a

298
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,850
crazy screen a lot more

299
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,240
cute and public face in my DNS with the

300
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,320
name the name there flashy what happens

301
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,380
when the attacker goes there he will

302
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,660
scan your DNS so he will

303
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,580
check what might be vulnerable  so

304
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,950
he'll find this machine there and he'll

305
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,050
start making attacks on it

306
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,920
and I'm cool you'll be able to catch

307
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,750
and what whoever might be

308
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,190
attacking you gives where the attacks may be coming,

309
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,100
which in this case, the attack

310
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,490
it came from india attack it came from

311
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,610
other countries here there is this city from

312
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,700
my machine it's free access to

313
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,910
these countries i can go closing by

314
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,839
countries it's an e-commerce it's more

315
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,040
complicated than the guy can e  tar

316
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,110
anywhere you can buy but then as you

317
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,670
are only in Brazil I only sell goods

318
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,870
to Brazil, I need to

319
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,820
open to India so it's cool that

320
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,980
you can see the attacks and we

321
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,790
see a lot of port 22 open port of

322
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,699
Rede TV  open and we were very concerned about

323
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:30,260
that so we start to close

324
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,170
it, we know that the ideal is VPN, do

325
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,230
n't you know that even with VPN it is possible to

326
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,209
be compromised, but you have

327
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,290
nowadays a port 22 open by the internet,

328
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,540
a port  Open RDP is very critical, right

329
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,579
so you can do this

330
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,899
mapping and generate a metric, right

331
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,939
And then you can go to a reporter at the end of the month

332
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,699
to show

333
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,970
you self-management there, we're having

334
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,009
this type of attack, these techniques are

335
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,079
being more  used Let's study these

336
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,180
techniques here we can get a

337
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,610
lot of information in this process from

338
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,610
Roney de Roni pot so

339
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,499
this process to be

340
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:16,680
studied is very interesting

341
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,810
and here's a tip.  a

342
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,370
little bit of subject then we started a

343
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,050
little warmer there already talking about

344
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,360
Roni attack pot here to say a

345
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,940
little about what

346
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,270
you're analyst set there we know that in our

347
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,260
Mara area we have  to give a

348
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,540
lot, right, so even more a list

349
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,790
of tea he has to understand willing

350
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,360
accident he has to study hard he

351
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,980
has to have a good reading he has to

352
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,110
stay inside what's been happening

353
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,880
in the world of threats that have been

354
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,920
happening I thought it was interesting to put

355
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,970
more here or  except the

356
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,110
journalist's Skill set here so he has to

357
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,270
understand networking Network operating systems

358
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,310
Blaze slow scripts to be a

359
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,750
developer But he has to understand

360
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,370
more or less the code he will

361
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,890
analyze some part of the code a man

362
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,059
sometime then defense  network

363
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,480
space incident it's here at

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,089
Mauer's web house so we can see that it's quite

365
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,659


366
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,628
complex there because you imagine you're going to

367
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:21,519
catch the incident you're going to try to find.

368
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,019
go to the last level, which would be the

369
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,010
last level, you get the a elci

370
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,920
what you said about the compromised artifact

371
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,370
you managed to detect it and find the

372
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,740
C2 which would be some control who is

373
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,780
doing this operation So you have to

374
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,330
understand several techniques, right So this is

375
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,040
the  idea

376
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,290
What's up

377
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,630
Oh and even more talking about

378
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,750
Larissa's intelligence routine here, I

379
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,640
separated here in some steps here,

380
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,560
how to learn the first step creating

381
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,560
sensors for monitoring a

382
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,930
Nowadays we don't have a monitoring tool, it

383
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,490
's complicated for us to

384
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,710
get it  identify something, right?

385
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,540
I think that, more basic

386
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,820
, network assurance starts there in the network layer,

387
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,350
in the suite, right, they already see

388
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,440
network protection, right?

389
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,760


390
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,490


391
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,100
we're not jealous of literacy,

392
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,970
we're not going to understand our

393
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,650
behavior from the network, how

394
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,790
am I going to know that there was a peak at

395
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,400
dawn, this could be malicious  If you know or not

396
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,710
I'm getting an attack or not so here

397
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,570
the tip is that this

398
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,640
monitoring intention has tools like you know

399
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,150
RPG DDS tools to understand what's

400
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,360
been happening on the network, it's based on

401
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,300
your signature

402
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,570
and here it belongs so it has this

403
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,360
module of 2  Note that it's free, right It's

404
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,160
all free tools that I'm

405
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,380
demonstrating here so I have you know

406
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,410
that free I have the cacerense that I

407
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,060
can use for that in the

408
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,750
behavioral analysis layer there are

409
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,660
Dr tools It would be ideal that the

410
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,940
antivirus only is no longer ok

411
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,800
solving so much, right look, then you

412
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,210
can trace the process if it's more

413
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,580
intelligent, right a little example and Dr

414
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,530
of the highlighted color has a plant but there's an idea

415
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,530
and it's free too I haven't tested it yet, it's

416
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:28,050
free deeply right I'm

417
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,710
testing the blue that I love Dr free  that you

418
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,290
can do this answer, it has

419
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,410
integration there with virustotal, a

420
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,960
very cool tool too, but then

421
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,730
there's this well-known getting out of here

422
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,310
Australia

423
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,170
Hi, there's some

424
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,300
artifact analysis tool there, with indicators, it

425
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,980
would be a virus Totally

426
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,090
a sandbox tool that the coconut

427
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,110
can't you analyze it's an artifact

428
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,570
you got or a line in the dead network

429
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,220
and in fact you have to analyze it quickly

430
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,840
So you have the free tools

431
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,690
there so there's a lot for me that have

432
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,280
a tool Dr has a tool

433
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,950
to even analyze the fact it's your use of

434
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,690
proactive tools to go out for it to

435
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,640
detect there in time to have peace

436
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,180
the food I can integrate

437
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,300
several  tools and the search for the IP or

438
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,160
for the name it will scan in

439
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,830
tools and bring information about It's

440
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,300
about this P this domain So you have to

441
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,930
automate and things, right

442
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,360
Hello you want to make a decoration of

443
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,090
actions and lists in the case of the example that

444
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,000
I leave Miter and in Mita you can

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,960
you have techniques one jokes

446
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,760
subdivided there right in the house in jail Know

447
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,520
that I'm in you So you can see the

448
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,460
every threat actor that the technician  If they

449
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,950
're using it and you can map

450
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,610
it on top of your organization I think

451
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,970
the real world if you have a joke

452
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,210
based on Miter techniques all the

453
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,860
attacks you get me and you

454
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,900
get out I managed to say that

455
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,450
you're being effective and avoid this  type

456
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,820
of technique an example here I have

457
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,430
some techniques here so we know

458
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,340
that fixing it is more difficult And then

459
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,950
I manage to map it so I

460
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,420
take all the techniques a myth and

461
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,430
work on my organization and

462
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,290
then I managed to map as much as possible  of

463
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,960
technique messing with the myth they take all the

464
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,850
information we give the techniques they

465
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,940
even give you like you

466
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,060
and this technique on top of the center

467
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,700
structure so this mapping they did is really cool.

468
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,210


469
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,070


470
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,710
spy that is used a lot

471
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,610
in the day to day when it's time to type in

472
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,710
people that in the beginning you can

473
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,290
share the information

474
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,990
you can leave Mississippi like a

475
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,810
cent  ro there of the fiis I made it free and have

476
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,730
paid children And then you can

477
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,040
share this information So I

478
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,750
know that there is information that we can

479
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,270
not share, but whatever it

480
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,620
is possible to share, we can

481
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,330
go up to the middle platform and leave it

482
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,000
publicly, right  so omitted and you

483
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,710
can do this mapping you

484
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,340
can get the various children and it's really

485
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,800
cool to work with this part of mispe

486
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,910
so with these tools that it was

487
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,670
demonstrated to come out I can have the base

488
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,860
with Leide it's setting up my

489
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,550
afternoon threat press structure  start to

490
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:40,920
have an

491
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,570
Ah, you understand how it works, so

492
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,890
you already have the basics, right

493
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,840
Hi and then go back to talking about the

494
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,910
company's need for threats.

495
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,340


496
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,060


497
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,890
yeah And then there's a new one there

498
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,830
that was the Dark Side, right, it was talked about

499
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,950
in the last two weeks and then it was on the

500
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,460
ranch there that affected several companies and it

501
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,290
was said that it was going to be a  ranch

502
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,650
where it is sold as a service, right and

503
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,860
monetizing several people there so the

504
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,420
need is increasing

505
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,340
among people every time it threatens I think that in the

506
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,260
future it will be crucial there for

507
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,320
every company as an lgpd is being

508
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,230
social then a sad threat will be

509
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,559
especially for the company, right,

510
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,110
so it's the definition within

511
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,779
this cyber threat, right? It warns the

512
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,179
opponents' knowledge, right?

513
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:57,450


514
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,519


515
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,679


516
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
then it will help us

517
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,690
understand what can become a threat

518
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,559
for us, the threat company. I have

519
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,909
separated an interesting example here,

520
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:22,860
let me show you here

521
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,420
and churr

522
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,509
is super GAC.

523
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,570


524
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:41,020


525
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,620
dreams

526
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,080
thewoman

527
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
Andthen

528
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
Andthen

529
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,380
I just get here and I'll even translate

530
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,490
here that it shows that it has even become a

531
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,290
job.

532
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,330


533
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,140
a rancid recruitment,

534
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,050
we know that the value is very high, right And

535
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,710
here in this matter it is explained here from the

536
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,800
bank only as a service an investigation was carried

537
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,090
out in this matter here that of the

538
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,460
recruitment, right And then the person went

539
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,710
through every other recruitment, they earned

540
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,700
how much  that it was possible to monetize And then

541
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,130
we see that it is increasingly becoming a

542
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,280
more organized crime. Tide, right? And then they are

543
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,840
creating recruitment for you to

544
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,150
work with this type of threat.

545
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,760


546
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,320
A read After this

547
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,350
article he explains you

548
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,380
and so they infiltrated the gang to be

549
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,010
recruited there and to understand how

550
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,280
monetization works.

551
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,950


552
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,679


553
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,179
if you are a sophisticated one,

554
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,860


555
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,210
and here, going back a little bit in the

556
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,179
intelligence, you know, as we are

557
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,909
talking about cybernetics, knowledge

558
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:42,789
about the opponents, right then, it was

559
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:47,470
shown that it is j  they

560
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,509
are even recruiting people to

561
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,960
do illicit activities, right? And then

562
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,759
we have changed the characteristics

563
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,869
of a threat company here

564
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,909


565
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,110


566
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,059
right or by

567
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,360
spying group by activists and

568
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,039
we try to know who can be

569
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:15,429
our threat actor to omit and a

570
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,179
place that we can start

571
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,159
jumping in I'll even show you

572
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,389
here what we do.

573
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:25,269
you can start by doing, let me find

574
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,279
Miter here the myth I can enter here

575
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,900
in Miter

576
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,920
Hi and then I can enter here

577
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,670
and in the groups, right I can get a group

578
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,970
from a survey here

579
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,080
because Financial won I will have several

580
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,630
groups here that reach the group  financial

581
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,260
and then I can go and analyze, we can

582
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,900
come here Fi the word France I gave 26

583
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,330
mine I can enter each of

584
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,240
these threat groups there to understand what

585
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,610
techniques they use and here it's cool that

586
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,550
they explain the  s techniques that are used only

587
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,340
gentlemen understand what is used Fish in

588
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,250
a technique works

589
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,860
file observation So you can make this

590
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,590
mapping start to understand who

591
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,450
may be attacking me and what techniques

592
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,010
they can use and we try to

593
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:30,080
cross this with our defenses  right, and

594
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,680
focused on risk, right, let's see which

595
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,720
asset we have, I can be more

596
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,490
vulnerable, it's exposed on the internet that

597
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,430
a more critical system than a more critical database,

598
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,590
and working on it focused

599
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,980
on risk.

600
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,370


601
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,760
focusing on the defense of Risk alone,

602
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,929
here today we see

603
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,630
protecting everything is almost impossible right

604
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,840
and one here that the cloud service is not

605
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,549
cheap is security tools too

606
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,950
but they are cheap and we try to focus on

607
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,900
what is being  hotter for our

608
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,010
organization, right And here to show a

609
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,100
little of Pilar's level of trajectory here,

610
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,809
we don't want to divide it into

611
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,799
three pillars, right in the tactical Pillar, that's

612
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,169
it here  it's punishable there by operators ok

613
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:24,540
And where it goes everything will fall right there

614
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,770
logins the alerts everything yodel the

615
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,030
ideal this team here to do the screening is to

616
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,830
try to make a good trip there, right to

617
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,600
move to the operational level, then

618
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,950
generation senior level  managers,

619
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,960
but in the technical management part,

620
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,860
we are going to refine the Ok

621
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,370
so that in this operational phase there is an

622
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,830
incident response that is executed here

623
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,600
and then the decisions will be transferred to the strategic level,

624
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,340
what will I

625
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,770
be done, right?  I had a

626
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,780
very serious incident, I'll move to the

627
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,300
strategic level or not that we're going to make

628
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,430
this level behave,

629
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,530
right, so the idea of these three

630
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,220
pillars there,

631
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,610
Hi and then I'll give you an idea here of the

632
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,870
tactical level without the  Intelligent 3D, right And then at

633
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,090
the tactical level we have a lot of

634
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,100
so that a lot

635
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,740
of false positives are

636
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,070


637
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,690
n't checked.

638
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,770
given over there, then, a

639
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,440
threat interview at the tactical level, we can

640
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,659
work by removing these Invalid indicators,

641
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,150
right, so as not to create too many false

642
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,880
positives, we will prioritize the feet of

643
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,320
vulnerability because, by doing

644
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,270
this mapping, we can

645
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,080
understand what the level of  maturity of

646
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,900
our systems which are vulnerable is

647
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,150
what type of vulnerability is more

648
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,120
critical, right,

649
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,490
we can automate the flow, right?

650
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,620


651
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,850


652
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,860
send

653
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,470
everything that is log everything that is system

654
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,230
we know there

655
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,169
is we can send it only sometimes

656
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,450
you have already sort of filtered this

657
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,110
information, right? So it will make it much easier

658
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,710
for the tactical level there, right? And then we

659
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,049
prioritize the indicators so that  the ones there

660
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,370
only that I can quickly identify

661
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,270
the alerts that warn being escalated.

662
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,200
So what threat understands we

663
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
can improve the process  this

664
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,640
is filtered, right?

665
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,200
And then at the operational level, the level without

666
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,190
fear that they threaten, the

667
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,660
ahi teams take a long time to find

668
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,470
information about the threat, sometimes they

669
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,110
have to reconstruct the attack to get more

670
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,440
complicated, right, to try to stop it, right  And

671
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,800
as the threat interest we can

672
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,530
provide context, it's also better

673
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,410
for the incident response team

674
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,090
so they can improve the

675
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,280
investigation has a reliable source of

676
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,310
research to already understand the technicians

677
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,280
methods the techniques will not

678
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,350
allow the team to laugh  and the difference

679
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,270
really quickly is the damage

680
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,550
caused, right, so I provide them with

681
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,040
more accurate information, right,

682
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,320
the techniques and methods. It's going to

683
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,250
facilitate a lot of operational level and the

684
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,400
strategic level is a level

685
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,340
where it comes from, right, usually investment in

686
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,620
serum

687
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,809
and  the people of an analyst or an

688
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:40,700
extra employee in our team, a

689
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,070
tool, we have to seem like

690
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,480
a solid background to

691
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,790
strategic level so at the strategic level,

692
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,340
without a little sad threat, it's kind of

693
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,800
lost right, they don't have the

694
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,210
necessary information to set priorities,

695
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,590
right?

696
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,390


697
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,980
speak

698
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,110
I need to buy a

699
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,600
three intelligence tool to protect myself from

700
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,940
threats x then you cannot

701
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:13,080
strategically demonstrate

702
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,050
this threat intelligence we will already be

703
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,700
able to provide the manager with a

704
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,130
greater understanding of the threats to

705
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,550
the business fifth the type of threats that

706
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,410
are so healthy  more critical for our business

707
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,560
you will help the children to communicate

708
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,020
with the executives you will be able to have

709
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,720
better information you will be

710
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,580
able to have a more formatted education,

711
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,570
right at a strategic level, better

712
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,730
then these tips that I would like

713
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,910
to share  to you guys

714
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,080
Hi, and coming back, it's the need for

715
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,110
cyber threat there in having

716
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,280
this control to  for today's worlds,

717
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,600
so we know that violations

718
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,030
have been happening in a serious way in

719
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,590
ENEM 2020. We had many attacks, and they

720
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,159
are relevant.

721
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,840


722
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,719
area and

723
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,630
that has this curiosity, there are some

724
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,690
relevant attacks here I'm going to get a site

725
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,950
here to rec

726
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:36,820
o apps you have 2020

727
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,030
What is a retrospective of the articles

728
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,929
from the year 2020 of what happened

729
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,820
here in Brazil, right, so they separated

730
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,730
there by January  February we had

731
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,810
several threats there, in March there was the

732
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,620
invitation, right there were several sites invaded, there were

733
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,870
several Exhibitions there were in July the

734
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,160
point Twitter invaded it's August

735
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,890
company leaks there were the pics

736
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,140
So there was a lot here in Brazil in the

737
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,900
year of two  a thousand and so if the company has

738
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,150
a well-formatted process, a

739
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,280
threat interview, I won't say that it will

740
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,800
avoid it, but it will be able to contain it as

741
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,230
quickly as possible, right, you have more

742
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,670
information about the attacks  You won't be

743
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,680
able to protect yourself faster,

744
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
right,

745
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,020
and look here, it will show more or less

746
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:43,890
what was relevant there in terms of information and

747
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,480
here to talk a little bit about the

748
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
world strategy to answer was

749
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,930
like I said at the beginning, we have to

750
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,350
have some tool  to monitor

751
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,510
some tool to bring these

752
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,260
inputs there and then, as was said, the

753
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,880
process can be summarized like this in the

754
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,080
correct form as many signatures as

755
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,930
possible and we can

756
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,390
use Messenger to do this, right

757
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,620
food products that we have

758
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,190
security, right, an idea  FPS I've seen a

759
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,110
lot of Faro there that the person neither used

760
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,900
the IP SDS nor uses the ideas mode,

761
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,090
except for the knowledge mode to

762
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,770
understand what's been happening, right

763
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,100
then work in the PS mode, right, the

764
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,810
same data to generate alerts and

765
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,000
monitor  the alerts don't feel operations,

766
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,460
only if you shop there, only when you

767
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,230
examine the alerts, you do the sorting

768
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,850
so that's what I said at the

769
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,660
beginning there is

770
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,180
Hi guys, no  it's a process for me to

771
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,130
monitor to respond to monitor to

772
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,590
respond is to collect alerts right then, but

773
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,420
that's what I give is it was a platform

774
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,850
for several sources is that being

775
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,010
Mississippi make a connection between all

776
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,750
security products I try to

777
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,090
interconnect all that  I have

778
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,740
security to get the information that

779
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,750
provides input Centralized a

780
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,760
platform, for example, we can

781
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,130
use the drive to do this, right or

782
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,040
deep in the air and then you can

783
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,470
centralize everything in place and then you

784
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,270
can have a better view of what's

785
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,690
happening  you imagine that you have

786
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,520
failure or one company and plague another

787
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,750
Cindy another and Dr before others

788
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,580
Imagine centralizing all types of

789
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,160
information from a single place and even if

790
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,660
you don't have it centralized how are

791
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,010
you going to do this filtering a

792
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,070
lot of work  arduous they are already there, it doesn't have

793
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,720
to be ending or looking, right, there's going to

794
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,820
come the source of everything that's on the side, right, you'll

795
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,670
just end up looking at

796
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,340
the critic and sometimes there's an ev  So

797
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,380
it's beating every day Helena is so

798
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,890
critical he's going to become critical there, it's

799
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,210
just the idea, right

800
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,230
Hi and then I'm back going back on

801
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,250
this afternoon of a lot of answering, then do

802
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,920
with the investing team and the most serious alerts,

803
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,740
right, analyze the attack, interrupt

804
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,320
the process  we try the coolest

805
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,120
in this process, you can catch an

806
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,010
attack in progress and I managed to stop it,

807
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,450
right with the information you have, right and

808
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,920
the reports created harm

809
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,290
self-management, right, the idea is also to separate

810
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,210
the electrons into levels, right, level 1 or 3

811
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,000
and  we try to analyze as soon as

812
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,370
possible and collect the evidence for

813
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,760
such an event, right, that would be ideal, right with

814
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,350
the cities, hand analysis, we will be

815
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,640
able to demonstrate Our effectiveness

816
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,150
owners Ok of our service right

817
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,339
and the child table I tried to separate

818
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,670
here what was planted  at the beginning there by

819
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,029
strategic tactical-operational level And

820
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:43,380
then the added value that

821
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,089
we believe we take, we can at the

822
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:49,109
tactical level prioritize the indicators we need

823
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:52,500
the pets prioritized the alerts at the

824
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,460
operational level, we can also

825
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,839
automate things and at the

826
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,190
strategic level we can take a

827
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,529
better pot, a more strategic part,

828
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:06,690
a better

829
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,299
intelligence, right?

830
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:14,400


831
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,099
example here drowning this Alert, right And it

832
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,930
was a company here, your company here

833
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,470
criminally institutes it receives an

834
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,430
average of 16 thousand alerts per week only

835
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,130
three thousand two hundred and eighteen alerts

836
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,009
and I considered reliable, right

837
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:36,849
nineteen percent only 705 400

838
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,920
users were investigated Look  then

839
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,809
what I said back there, you're no

840
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:43,509
use 16,000 Alerts only 3,000 were

841
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:49,000
created, only 700 were analyzed And then if it's

842
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,710
time he spent more than one million and

843
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,900
two hundred a year answering these

844
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,960
alerts wrongly, right then what

845
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,029
happens Sometimes the  we end up passing a

846
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:01,269
lot Alert, right, and then valid here

847
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:03,369
point us to the same conclusion in a

848
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,750
large retail and activity chain.

849
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,130
Hacker ages existed

850
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,670
card processing systems generated 60,000

851
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,930
alerts so we imagine we will be

852
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,700
able to analyze everything because

853
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,369
we have interconnected systems And

854
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,990
intelligence threatens we can

855
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,180
cross information these alerts will be

856
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,670
created fewer alerts will arrive - false

857
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,819
positive  and we're going to be able to generate

858
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:30,140
more quality in our service,

859
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,089
rather than turning a lot of false

860
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,160
positives and then there's no way we're not

861
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,779
going to be able to analyze, right?

862
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:43,279


863
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:45,559


864
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,960
I found it very interesting even

865
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,579
until you analyze this report there is a

866
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,779
reporter from Fairy ai ai

867
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,320
And

868
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:09,850
ai today a Pt 1 un

869
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,550
and this report I found very cool

870
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,180
they will need that they took apt1 by until

871
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,680
the end of it so it is very

872
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,150
interesting like that  from ours, we

873
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,240
also read a lot of these reports of

874
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,010
threats and they managed to get the

875
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,410
entire operation of the app in detail,

876
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,360
some that are Chinese, right  there's a lot to lose

877
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,780
from China and to segment it all the

878
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,050
communication process And where is the land from

879
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:40,420
And there's a lot of information here

880
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,470
opening a very extensive report so they

881
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,510
show the whole chain of what was done

882
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,690
what tool was used so it's a

883
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,610
tip there  to see if you can report there, try

884
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,350
to understand them. They even show the

885
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,540
blocks that were used to

886
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,900
make the attacks so there's a lot of

887
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,480
cool information in this one in this Report

888
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,780
Hi, what do I say to you?

889
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,670
Léo Kids icing on the cake  it's also

890
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,640
no use filling my tool for

891
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,250
free and only

892
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,300
bringing me duplicate data. The idea is

893
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,810
I have good spirits and if possible

894
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,560
some paid kits for later I

895
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,020
managed to cross this information

896
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,329
this is right away

897
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:37,319
and in relation to the difference pains  as

898
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,329
I said, we showed the

899
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:43,170
FAI report here and then we are always

900
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,420
looking at the reports of what

901
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,549
has been happening, right? And then we get a

902
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:53,710
lot of information in  your reports, right

903
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,580
Hi, and here everything we've been talking

904
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,320
about, everything you have to study

905
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,710
to get to the threat intelligence, and

906
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,080
here's a collection of consortia here

907
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,609
that would be me data from my internal company's

908
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:14,500
internal registry of

909
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,619
corporate security  supplier report

910
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,060
sharing Government sources o

911
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,390
Cíntia I find it difficult And then I define

912
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,550
what I'm going to use, right?

913
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,740


914
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,290


915
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,420
I

916
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,490
defined some priority there than

917
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,410
what I'm going to use

918
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,470
, and here the idea was to demonstrate

919
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,240
some platforms or thinking here

920
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,450
commercials of intelligence from a person

921
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,520
that we have some tools

922
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,819
here, we talked about mispe's, right Then we have

923
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,150
the cif if you or  request here the

924
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,309
most Melody night trio that gives up

925
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:56,589
also that is a threat there is a man

926
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,920
sit there And then we have the

927
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,750
commercial tools do you need a pallet anomaly do you

928
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,960
want and  I know some tools here

929
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,200
and there are the community and they

930
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,170
also serve as

931
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,809
open-source versions Easy paid versions right I

932
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:16,240
use it a lot to see my effort the one

933
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,280
I use the most here now around TX

934
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,650
also has a misp so that to have

935
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,940
one  The idea that there are free tools out

936
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,520
there for us is starting in

937
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,559
this part of threat intelligence,

938
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:30,449
oh and here talk a little bit about

939
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:32,430
external monitoring, right? Where

940
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,689
can we start with external monitoring?

941
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:36,449


942
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:39,119


943
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,160
It's a really cool place where a

944
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,239
lot of new stuff comes out there, people post the

945
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,709
hits too, we're always

946
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:49,549
monitoring Reddit they have podcast

947
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:53,459
newsletters from some organizations before

948
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:57,779
Dragon and then we've got to see if

949
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,140
Mário goes out weekly from some

950
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,969
companies have  there are tents to

951
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:09,209
listen to the cool ones and we see the

952
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:12,299
intelligence reports there and we

953
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:14,910
participate in some sales groups

954
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,680
so to the external part  erna we

955
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,829
try to feed on these types of

956
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:21,490
information

957
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,390
and for the internal part it would be more to see the

958
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,910
internal tickets, right, study the

959
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,250
internal threats, I think I lost a record that

960
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,550
we receive, right, threat signatures

961
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,850
alerting the failures of inclusion what they

962
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,470
tried to do  we identify in the

963
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,450
failure, we understand to identify those trying to

964
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,000
identify this foot by the end,

965
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,190
ranking the most critical units in

966
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,220
our environment, right and the

967
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,830
internal incidents, so there is a lot that we

968
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,780
have a lot of

969
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,060
internal homework so we can also go later

970
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,830
for the outside, these would be the tips

971
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,350
to study, right? We always have to

972
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,010
study, try to participate in

973
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,940
CPF. There are online material

974
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,630


975
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,920


976
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,900
certifications  Neves,

977
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,210
which is a tool that you can

978
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,060
train the incident response, it turns

979
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:32,790
Pablo in the end so you have a challenger here

980
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,920
from the incident response  real entities you have

981
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,170
schism log analysis which is

982
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,410
Windows you have WordPress log analysis

983
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,500
so it simulates a lot of the real world

984
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
and nothing better than you train it to

985
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,370
improve your Skill then that's what

986
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,510
we know when we go  an

987
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,150
internal accident we'll have to go

988
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,550
or solve as soon as possible and

989
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,530
sometimes there won't be time for us to

990
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,810
spread the word

991
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:03,700
so that's a tip, it's Guti Neves,

992
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,569
right

993
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,780
here, now I'll talk a

994
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,950
little bit about some tools  that

995
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,870
we can use for those who don't

996
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,110
know neon, it's a sandbox that's pretty

997
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:23,280
cool one interactively And

998
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,060
that's what I can do in it I can

999
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,620
analyze the threats there so I have

1000
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,220
it here and I can very well in a Tasca

1001
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,950
here or  open an RL that I want if I

1002
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,110
put a url here it will open for

1003
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,910
me inside a VM I will do the

1004
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,590
guard pilot it's easy it will

1005
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,950
analyze for me it's very cool and then I

1006
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,530
have some audiences here now I don't have

1007
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,020
any  here i can click  in one of an

1008
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,990
audience here that someone submitted

1009
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,280
Hi and then I can see the process what

1010
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,010
was done and the coolest thing is that I

1011
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,640
can see the report

1012
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,480
I have the graphic part of the process

1013
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,550
is the graphical part

1014
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:24,060
and close here I can see it in the  Mitre

1015
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,820
what technique The

1016
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,680
techniques that are being used by are being used for

1017
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,590
this reason I have a report it is

1018
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,090
possible to see who is

1019
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,280
this malicious activity, we are very

1020
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,780
cool that it already takes all the information,

1021
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,840
right then you can see the

1022
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,900
executable  Malicious is Procel the

1023
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,330
processes And then for you, the answer

1024
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,250
is part of making it easy, right And you do this

1025
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,020
by hand, you take the artifact

1026
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,240
in your hand and try to analyze it

1027
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,700


1028
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,330


1029
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,640


1030
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,400
shows you the IP here on this foot here he's

1031
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,290
telling me it was malicious So you

1032
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,840
can easily identify it, give a

1033
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,740
hint there or

1034
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:24,320
and the inhibum of this NS tool, two

1035
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,690
also have a tool  it's really cool and for

1036
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,550
free you can map the

1037
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,760
domain So you put your domain there

1038
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,850
an example here I go I'm with it

1039
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,790
here I'll put a domain here

1040
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:44,290
so I put it just for Gol

1041
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,120
A globo.com And then it will map  for me

1042
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,250
every domain he'll try a brute

1043
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,870
Force inside to stay more or less

1044
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,320
which boys have subdomains so

1045
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,260
he'll give me a pious piece and

1046
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,060
that's even for nice people we

1047
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,810
sometimes don't know the so-called Shadow

1048
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,850
Fight and visuals that  they create systems that are

1049
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,100
separate from our sector and we

1050
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,840
don't know if it is published in the DNA and

1051
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,190
so we can map the

1052
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,520
DNS quickly so it's really cool,

1053
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,610
even we can get a job with a

1054
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,710
Sunday a reputation a bad reputation

1055
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,140
there that  I don't know if there is a Domain here

1056
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,470
for me to put because I would be able to

1057
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,390
see

1058
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,480
the address must have the domain and then I would be

1059
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,250
able to see which it responds to

1060
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,839
which there is a little button here

1061
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,970
which it responds to And then you p  You can play

1062
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,940
more than one so sometimes you block

1063
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,349
not only, it's a pity it's going to solve then you

1064
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,910
block the DNA and if you block

1065
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,970
everyone, you understand And he's one of each, right if

1066
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,770


1067
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,320
Flamengo isn't too cool.

1068
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,890


1069
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,740
there is one of the minutes

1070
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,870
of the increase in the number also a

1071
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,690
nice family it has its paid version and then i

1072
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,020
can identify who it might be if

1073
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,780
pity an example there i'll take the

1074
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,980
left put I'll get this bad it's

1075
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,390
here that i identify this P  then I

1076
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,290
can come on Sunday impulses and see in

1077
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:34,200
SP and he will tell me

1078
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,410
what is from Russia and he will respond to

1079
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,720
this one will have cases that you will have to

1080
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,300
respond to more than there are more people

1081
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,540
using it is not for more than one face and

1082
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,430
then it's complicated for you to block you get

1083
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,859
a King root hippie who has a thousand

1084
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,380
hanging site will block SP It's just not

1085
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,180
worth it then It's cool let's do this

1086
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,910
mapping here today with do minutes

1087
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,790
it's pretty cool because you let me see

1088
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,950
if I put it  here Globo

1089
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,180
a response

1090
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,339
and he's going to show me he gives me more options

1091
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:13,980
here from when it was created

1092
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:20,940
and when it was changed And he says here that

1093
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,789
there are five more sites in this

1094
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:26,009
P Got it cool for you when you

1095
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,359
do this mapping there for you to

1096
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,509
identify, right, so a Sunday uses

1097
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,740


1098
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,369
The answer is cool to know what the purpose is,

1099
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:38,640
you see what is being used the most

1100
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,790
by the attackers, right? So I came here in the

1101
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:45,710
sport of B

1102
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,750
I will look there today There are already some here

1103
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,100
Floyd there I understand profp la commande ir

1104
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,370
remote execution E  then I can get one, I

1105
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,350
can forever have a lot of it, I

1106
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,910
can even see the proof of concept

1107
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,640
here so and there, or if I can

1108
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,100
cross with the systems I have, I

1109
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,500
can quickly identify there

1110
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,300
which might be vulnerable, right so it's

1111
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,180
a tip  to analyze here in my sport

1112
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,319
of

1113
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:26,330
B Windows and also a tool to

1114
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,700
do reputation analysis of p&d

1115
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,720
domain and also widely used I

1116
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,390
'll show you

1117
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,630
a gre-nal here if I'm going to try to get that

1118
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,319
same IP

1119
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,750
oh and I'm coming back here at the Green

1120
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,690
House what is he going to bring me

1121
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,130
and he didn't take anything here

1122
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,200
the man

1123
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,150
is the one who shows the threats there are 331

1124
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,760
thousand to the protocols of the main

1125
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,530
organizations but he didn't take anything but

1126
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,910
it's just another tool  so you can

1127
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:15,109
analyze the threat then the reputation of p

1128
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:18,990
doing analysis you have to

1129
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:22,129
log in but it's more of a G1 tool

1130
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,619


1131
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,960
Hi and there's a hacker target that

1132
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,770
I also find interesting, this tool that

1133
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,020
sometimes you sometimes want to do an

1134
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,700
analysis but  then you don't want to use it

1135
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,770
You don't have the IP it's a machine a VM

1136
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,670
there it's ready to take the test search there

1137
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,470
you can do it quickly online

1138
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,290
here You sometimes don't use your cell phone you

1139
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,120
can do it this is the incident you

1140
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,520
're on the street You've seen the  IP then you won't go

1141
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,940
I'll do an hla-dp analysis of

1142
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,550
this tool and it already makes an animal

1143
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,730
for here it already shows that there are two

1144
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,890
open doors here you understand it's very fast you

1145
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,200
can get this information

1146
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,869
Hi and then you're using infrastructure  ture

1147
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:13,260
of them, right,

1148
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,790
so it's a tip too

1149
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:23,509
Hi, yeah, but the rack, too, to

1150
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:26,509
check the leader, right. And then the same thing

1151
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:28,279
as that of anymap, only you

1152
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:29,809
can pick it up and see the header reader.

1153
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:32,359
And then you know you have it

1154
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:34,009
a lot of information in the header, right

1155
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:37,999
information of the Server version is what

1156
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,729
is being used And then quickly

1157
00:55:40,729 --> 00:55:42,709
also through its platform there you

1158
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:47,690
can do this analysis, right And then there's even

1159
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,209
more stuff there on that target

1160
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,769
that you can see for free

1161
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:54,979
there's even  is the roadpress scanner of do

1162
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:56,900
pau you can even use them to

1163
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,719
run on your on your platform there

1164
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:03,480
check your system So this tip there

1165
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,590
I have also been that for those who don't

1166
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,530
know this platform it collects

1167
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,130
cheap leaked kisses and feeds it to the

1168
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,100
base and then  you put your email there and

1169
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,680
it talks about leaked or not and I'll

1170
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,330
take the test for my email here

1171
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,800
you'll enter here and I'll put

1172
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,030
mine here my email

1173
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,790
here mine Does it say or not  he says that

1174
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:40,580
All this was leaked here from LinkedIn base

1175
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:46,670
in Miss 2020 nukato my

1176
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,470
e-mail has already been leaked in many bases in

1177
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,280
nine dates, right, so it's also nice

1178
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,650
if possible to do a mapping there

1179
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,780
of the company's e-mails where you work

1180
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,840
for São service there is an ati that you

1181
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,150
can scrape in PE this

1182
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,850
information will make a blunt here

1183
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:08,600
but it's paid it's cheap even but it's also a tip

1184
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,130
to check if there's any leaked email, you

1185
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,110
know, they're always

1186
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,780
buying new bases, right  they put the

1187
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,060
bases that they currently have here so it

1188
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,930
's another tip I

1189
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,340
'll bring a tool also

1190
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,410
used there to do this type of

1191
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,020
analysis and it has one called

1192
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,840
Transformers rap which are plugins that I

1193
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,700
can integrate with several

1194
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,570
free and paid tools What's up  on it I have

1195
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,460
put the IP like a drawing here it

1196
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,040
will already bring me everything detailed on which

1197
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,790
provider of which.as who it is Who

1198
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,850
signed this IP it will bring me I

1199
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,860
don't know if black with high reputation it  it does

1200
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,220
everything automated for me it's a neat way

1201
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,300
to get the poorly paid,

1202
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,180
Nita Nita is that I

1203
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,370
also showed a knowledge base there

1204
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,220
that I can see the techniques there, it's

1205
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:12,410
cool for you to do this mapping there

1206
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:16,400
and Open close a site there  one more, there are

1207
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,890
others, right, I can see the chips

1208
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:22,820
that are being used the most, the

1209
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:27,290
attacks, right? So I have to go really

1210
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,900
cool.

1211
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,430


1212
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,920


1213
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,050


1214
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,110
this Facebook financial companies there

1215
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,960
are mine to use those that are being most

1216
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,910
attacked in used to do

1217
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,770
phishing is cool Take a look here

1218
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,990
Hi I'm Dan for those who don't know

1219
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,850
study is a platform there that I

1220
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,860
can check the second skills

1221
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,440
which is very  complex tool is very

1222
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,320
robust and I can bring a lot of

1223
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,510
information I can even analyze

1224
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,050
that p and bring information that I

1225
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,900
can use in my favor let me

1226
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,070
get that

1227
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:21,190
in SP I go here n  Dan's show and I'm going to

1228
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:28,290
analyze it, it didn't bring me anything, right

1229
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,480
and it's just any fight here and then I

1230
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,609
can catch that and it will bring me

1231
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:40,059
when the region I have open garden

1232
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,890
will bring me technology and 10

1233
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,660
skills Look at this  I'm giving it

1234
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,180
already bringing me already telling me how many

1235
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,539
girls Beauty there is in this P it's already very

1236
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:50,769
cool you can do this

1237
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:55,779
mapping of your infra the ideal is no

1238
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:59,619
it's not the hyper public take care of your

1239
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:01,240
daughter not here at the show giving it's possible

1240
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,869
you  block their scanners, right? If

1241
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,250
anyone wants, I can even pass the IP

1242
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,410
of the scanners to him, there's no such

1243
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,970
information, then he's giving it to

1244
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:12,069
the attacker, then all the information, you

1245
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:13,269
imagine that the attacker will already have

1246
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:15,180
information about this P's abilities.

1247
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,890
it's another tip there also

1248
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:18,779


1249
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:22,500
to do analysis

1250
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,680
Hi and the virustotal which is another sandbox

1251
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:32,160
there besides the n Bruno besides the one from the ku do

1252
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,000
cho paste There's a Total virus you want one

1253
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,750
too that I use a lot because

1254
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:44,970
they Total you put  the IP put it here

1255
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,030
I can put the IP and give it a sushi it

1256
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,120
will do the analysis for me it's very cool

1257
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,070
you can put the hash by

1258
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,740
domain it will bring me all the

1259
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,040
information so it's another source of

1260
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,680
information there that we can consult

1261
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,860
as you saw that there were several

1262
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,480
tools and informed here and talk a

1263
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,560
little bit about digital where to start

1264
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,900
as we assemble a little part of the

1265
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,610
world purely as we start by

1266
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:23,520
picking you up and I hope it has

1267
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,110
been beneficial for you If anyone

1268
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,360
wants  ask any questions you can talk to

1270
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,980
