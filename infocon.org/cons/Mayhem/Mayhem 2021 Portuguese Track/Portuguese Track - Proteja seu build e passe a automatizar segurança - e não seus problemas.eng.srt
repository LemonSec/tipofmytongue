00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,340
Hello everyone, Good morning or good

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,320
afternoon depending on when you are going to watch

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,839
this lecture, it will be recorded. I

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,820
would like to thank everyone who is

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,759
live for your time on the weekend

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,909
and here we go I would like today to tell

7
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,890
you a little about security  you know

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,770
my name is Carolina, who doesn't know me, the

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,540
present doesn't just go up famous for you

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,240
to know me and I'm sales director

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,910
for Latin America so you

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,500
're sure the world must already be thinking that it's going to

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,720
be another commercial pit ordering product

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,100
obviously that  it's not and could not, but I

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,940
'm going to talk about a very interesting topic,

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,749
which is security and security, it

17
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,969
's a topic that brings what is on

18
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,550
the developer's spine, right?

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,149


20
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,159


21
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,589
I'm not going to talk about

22
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:54,840
products

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,510
eee let's go and if you have any

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,830
questions later I'm sending you, we

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,850
'll answer there as time

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,350
permits,

27
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,150
we're not going there, let's talk a

28
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,299
little bit  of secure development, right,

29
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,009
we were in fashion, isn't everyone

30
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,920
talking about Cláudio development, I

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,540
see that there is a BO in the development area,

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,290
right? Unfortunately, in

33
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,880
virtual events, it's very bad because I

34
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,290
can't talk.

35
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,700
to know who's

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
here to know if I can

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,210
joke with the developer I don't know if

38
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,899
we have many here watching But let's

39
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,310
go when we talk about

40
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,259
development.

41
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,149


42
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,940
image is

43
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,800
I wanted to ask you I

44
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,229
wanted you to stop and think if you

45
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,229
are doing all of this here, that

46
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,850
it is all security processes or just

47
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,030
a drying of best practices to

48
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,860
ensure that you have a secure code

49
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,210
and we know it with  code has to be

50
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,619
safe so that your application is

51
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,830
safe there when it's in production and

52
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,690
then there's a security problem you can

53
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,360
avoid

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,930
o and here are Sa's recommendations  we

55
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,788
'll talk more about this poster

56
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,440
we like that they have for several

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,510
technologies but there are several

58
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,150
security recommendations for you to make in the

59
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,640
pre-invitation and everyone thinks that

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,100
complicated security security is expensive so

61
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,470
I'm talking here about

62
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,270
modeling processes and  not necessarily

63
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,980
investment right Mainly

64
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,750
investment of time you need to

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,480
have and I wonder do you

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,300
developers make this type of meat

67
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,790
Does the companies you work

68
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,250
do this type of drying Does the

69
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,040
security team have visibility that the team

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,690
of development track

71
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,690
security box says code so the answer

72
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,030
is obviously no one does it,

73
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,610
no one else does the developer averse to

74
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,040
security, right?

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,550


76
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,800


77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,690
I came that I do more towards the

78
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,400
end because the theme here is not to talk about

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,370
me not shaving this

80
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,000
is a biographical more complementing what

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,430
and  I said at the opening, right, my job is my

82
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,860
responsibility to sales and I was

83
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,080
thinking Wow, don't raise a child, when

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,299
is there any content that I can bring?

85
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,430


86
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,019


87
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,260


88
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,659
and in the area of information security,

89
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,730
the video Claro the people

90
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,290
with whom to interact she was inspired

91
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,150
security participation in security events

92
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,099
only her article on security

93
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,620
and now working with Cláudio who is the

94
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,720
focus of water in the company I represent

95
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,959
that works with security  from which time

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,150
I started to have some contact with the

97
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,250
developers, obviously because it's the

98
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,510
team that works with Cláudio with

99
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,879
digital with digital transformation and I

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,609
see that just as in the security area,

101
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,049
the guys don't understand anything about

102
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,400
development, the

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
development garage doesn't care about

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,349
security is he is an averse team because

105
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,359
security has always been what prevents what

106
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,350
blocks what

107
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,350
the console process  air processing and

108
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,590
compromises performance so I said

109
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,810
stop if there is nothing in the security area, guys,

110
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,030
it doesn't mean that the

111
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,620
personnel must not understand security,

112
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,029
but the personnel must have a

113
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,440
prejudice with security, I have

114
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,420
noticed this And then  I came to bring a

115
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,810
little bit of trying to bring a

116
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,850
conciliatory message for you

117
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,420
developers to be able to get along with

118
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,250
your company's security staff and

119
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,110
obviously offering them

120
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,210
some things in exchange, which in this case is the automation

121
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,830
that occurs here from our of ours

122
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,790
chat and already finishing our water

123
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,140
but Beyond the Legend I don't want to take

124
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,650
too much time so in the introduction But this

125
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,530
is a survey by Sona team I don't know

126
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,540
if you know from last year a

127
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,670
very fun report and I recommend

128
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,040
that you look for it  You have you

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,170
guys download It's been a really cool read about

130
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,070
the community of must and they say that

131
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,360
the evolution of this report is

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,229
good 9:20, right, the developers They

133
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,389
're  well that security is important but they

134
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,430
don't have time to spend on it

135
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,960
so that was the beginning more painting than what

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,139
I've seen is and just if we don't have time

137
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,930
let's spend time automating security

138
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,419
can and should be automated now let's

139
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,129
just contextualize everyone here  on the

140
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,710
same page and talk about how it was a

141
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,110
traditional development environment,

142
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,509
I had my development team that

143
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,479
developed a software, it's not one of

144
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,340
those guys developing there, just

145
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,469
stop developing an application, I had

146
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,529
my operation team that provisioned

147
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,900
the servers  right uncle, you need to

148
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
do Deploy right when I do

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,949
Deploy I knew more or less where the

150
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,960
application was running which server

151
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,569
Which virtual machine could I

152
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,610
physically make those servers pull out

153
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,550
the network cable you know where it was right And

154
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,469
then it comes  the people holding

155
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,310
it after everything was working

156
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,900
round saw security personnel

157
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,370
doing cheka gen believed politi

158
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,800
PS Décio and obviously they applied tests,

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
right so that's how it worked, it's

160
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,810
the traditional environment and we know

161
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,669
that in today's world it's not like that, right?

162
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,110


163
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,690


164
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,610
more or less

165
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,650
like we make a suit, right, so if there was

166
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,900
that visibility of the whole, a

167
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,540
seamstress would make a full flashlight and he

168
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,520
happened to reach the end of the last

169
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,949
test then I need to press here I

170
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,660
need to press there I need to do I don't

171
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,300
know what he came back  to the beginning and I was

172
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,940
able to make the adjustments and then it

173
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,600
just happened that there was a problem with the sleeve of

174
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,940
my screen on my jacket. I don't just send the

175
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,590
sleeve to fix it, I have to send it all the

176
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,900
time to be fixed so it

177
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,720
was a process more  complicated, right,

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760
so I couldn't not make a

179
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,800
production line for suits in this

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
concept. I'm talking about you

181
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,810
treating each Love Jacket, taking it

182
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,350
back, I sewed it was more or less

183
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,130
Hi Rose  just like that and then what happens,

184
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,060
Garner comes and tells us 10 if he

185
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,650
knows a research company

186
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,470
that the digital transformation

187
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,930
is a reality in it, we have been

188
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,050
following this day-to-day companies

189
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,850
migrate to the cloud more and more or

190
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,250
companies that already  Nanuv are born and I said that

191
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,620
by the end of 22 more 75 percent of

192
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,820
companies will be working with

193
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,030
applications I continued to use and that it is

194
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,860
totally related and

195
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,660
native cloud applications are applications that

196
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,600
work with microservices Sorry,

197
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,100
they work with the concept of

198
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,640
agile development.  box

199
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,160
development mat not if the focus

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,890
worked with container they are orchestrated it

201
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,250
is and were born to work in Uber

202
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,750
we are talking about

203
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,460
extremely smaller components it is quite

204
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,600
distributed

205
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,540
Hi and this is the new reality, right, so you

206
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,160
see that I said things that were not

207
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,200
mentioned before here  it was a lot of automation

208
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,130
distributed components And here comes

209
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,890
this meme, I think it's great because it

210
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,710
summarizes this a lot  this world now of

211
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,770
devoxx, right, Errar is human and propagating the

212
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,360
error on all servers

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,900
automatically is boxed so here comes the

214
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,480
problem, right Carolina says that now

215
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,850
everyone is working

216
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,340
automatically and I here Estrada

217
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,660
microservice but then she only talks about

218
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,809
automation and another hit the problem

219
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,909
screwed up, right It's more or less this here just

220
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,919
to greet the continuation of the

221
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,020
conversation right one person asks but

222
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,000
I haven't gone over it yet,

223
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
right You can explain to me Then

224
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,690
colleagues talk like that.  who

225
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,940
know how to script, right? So the script,

226
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,950
we know that if we run the wrong script,

227
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,290
the damage is done, so

228
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,640
we'll get back to

229
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,940
serious again when we talk about

230
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,579
new architectures

231
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,399
and technologies, obviously we

232
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,489
're talking about new threats  and for new

233
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,170
threats we can't do security

234
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,489
in the same way, we have to do

235
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:10,610
security in a different way so

236
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,049
we're having attacks today that we

237
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,329
don't  it was a while ago so we

238
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,689
talk a lot today about the supply chain it

239
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,929
's because you reuse code so I

240
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,189
have to ensure not only that my

241
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,259
code is safe but the code I

242
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,809
borrowed is also safe I

243
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,819
have to ensure that my kubernetes

244
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,649
be safe until 15 years ago no one

245
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,239
where to buy in this part of the

246
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,429
clan there are words container so only for

247
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:36,879
the new ones I can't just say

248
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,499
sorry I can't just bring the

249
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,420
traditional safety that I had in

250
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,459
the environment to this world right there good

251
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,179
buggy right  Yeah, you come tell me that we

252
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,559
're all going to a new way

253
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,869
of doing architecture that has no

254
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:55,879
security solution for it Or that everything is very

255
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,040
new, new threats because I didn't

256
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,590
stay the same,

257
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,370
because it won't be ok.

258
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,850
when there is a great

259
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,780
technological culture that brings benefits, it

260
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,430
is here we could talk for hours and

261
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,840
hours about the benefits of working

262
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,880
with this type of  application you can't

263
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,060
go back does it is and especially this

264
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,420
type of application for the cloud you have

265
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,480
the ability to optimize

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,750
computational resources financial resources in

267
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,340
infrastructure investment much

268
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,890
more You have one with them in a

269
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,880
much larger city imagine the companies

270
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,310
example being able to grow and

271
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,100
pay for consumption on a Black Friday on

272
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,290
Mother's Day, not Christmas, it's a

273
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,180
super high consumption of infrastructure

274
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,190
and the rest of the year when there is not so much

275
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,440
sales volume, pay for a small waist,

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,060
this is only possible in your

277
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,160
new one with  This new way of

278
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,370
applying is then we'll have

279
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,600
to find a way to stay

280
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,540
And then this new world is here to

281
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,550
stay And then we have to use

282
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,839
the technology in our favor so if we

283
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,730
optimize the error it's the Rocks, right vomit

284
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,889
optimize in a way that isn't

285
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,990
the mistake, right, so use the

286
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,420
security, I didn't tell you how it

287
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,610
was a traditional environment like this

288
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,130
environment now, didn't I?  sto of 30,000 feet

289
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,380
tall I have my

290
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,360
development as I had before, right, I'll

291
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,389
develop the images of these images, I

292
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,329
'll then do mine contains the

293
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,639
case or functions of this with various types

294
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,279
of workload on

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
and I no longer have the team  of operation

296
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,569
that goes provisional server I have

297
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,420
an orchestration solution that

298
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,689
will tell where each of these

299
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,579
images of each of these disputes

300
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,689
goes, right Where will they run? Where will they be

301
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,129
executed? I don't know where they

302
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,399
are anymore.  that I

303
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,410
can even have visibility but it's more I

304
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,269
lose more control of where

305
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,279
the applications are running are these

306
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,680
images These containers sometimes they

307
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,779
are running in

308
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,110
different datacenters in which of different So

309
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,259
this is the new way to do it is to do it

310
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,540
application And here comes

311
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,420
security what does security do after the

312
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,060
application has been implemented nothing security

313
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,740
there's no way to do anything you

314
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,710
can't apply a pet or apply a

315
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,270
security rule in the same way

316
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,310
you applied we are talking now about

317
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,860
container micro service we are

318
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,190
talking about dozens of images in

319
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,950
the normal environment it is the medium environment

320
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,620
because for large applications you can

321
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,380
have hundreds of images if not more than

322
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,420
that  right then you have dozens of

323
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,610
images you will have hundreds of

324
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,170
containers of a very large amount

325
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,570
right Much bigger problems because of one

326
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,790
image You can have several containers and

327
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,410
you will have a lifetime of each

328
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,600
container of approximately 2 and a half days.

329
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,000
having here in if you stay there for a

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
while is counting here when you run

331
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,500
a single task and die So how

332
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,880
am I going to apply a pet in the

333
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,130
computational eye so volatile how am I

334
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,620
going to create communication scent rules

335
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,030
where I have computational units

336
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,820
with addresses  so dynamic IP addressing

337
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,520


338
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,680
the yard how to create a rule

339
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,350
based on IP and the port there doesn't exist

340
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,490
so remember what I said I

341
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,980
need new techniques  security cases to

342
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,690
protect your environment so you can

343
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,460
see that the environment is the problem

344
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,190
is done so I just can't apply a

345
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,530
test, right, do the pet management in My

346
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,330
Container, you have to do our security in some other

347
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,920
way, right how does the

348
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,740
we do not tighten it in Contenda it was

349
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,840
just so you know the tip that comes from China

350
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,730
that that bunch of imported

351
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,380
electronics you bought there is a solution to

352
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,210
put part of the tip with it here, it

353
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,350
's very very expensive, can you

354
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,810
fix it, you'll do a repair if  it is

355
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,120
obviously necessary that in the world of

356
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,060
devops in the world of cloud

357
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,800
development mat you will not apply

358
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
pest I told you, then you think chipped

359
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,380
chipped because you don't have to do it I'll

360
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,780
stay with my insecure environment Delivery

361
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,930
to God is not like that so I remember

362
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,990
at the beginning  I showed you some

363
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,529
controls recommended by

364
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,769
and they are super so I asked if you

365
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,749
know if you have heard if

366
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,120
some of those controls you execute

367
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,209
utam that it's a control that's here up here in the

368
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:29,069
pre-commit in the upper

369
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,779
right corner I don't know if you can see

370
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,199
my mouse but anyway and there are several other

371
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,329
recommendations from the years for

372
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:41,519
cloud applications that you can do right And

373
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,480
down here  he recommends how you

374
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,579
take a safe program from devops it's not

375
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,499
a program that should be cups So you

376
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,389
put security inside

377
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,240
this continuous integration continuous

378
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,490
delivery process and he also talks a lot about the

379
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,699
shift-left concept and if you read

380
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,069
this This well  is that I'll leave the

381
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,870
link for everyone here later you

382
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,360
'll notice two things I want to

383
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,910
comment with you automation which is the

384
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,470
objective here that I'm going to talk to

385
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,800
you about and shift-light because that's

386
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,540
exactly what you'll have to use  yours

387
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,760
and for this type of application so you

388
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,490
can protect these images protect

389
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,790
your father pe line and not be at the mercy of

390
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,350
a functional environment publish Pet how to

391
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,260
apply even then when we talk

392
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,560
of automation we have to think

393
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,920
about the development mat,

394
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,660
auxiliary forgiveness we have to think about

395
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,850
a production line So think about

396
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,620
that automobile production that

397
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,140
everyone has seen there, every assembler

398
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,880
has so each Station, right,

399
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,460
assemble a little piece of the  car or

400
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,620
do something in the car so

401
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,220
imagine that you have a paint drying,

402
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,110
I'll stay until a station to

403
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,940
paint the car my car said there in

404
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,950
red and some more if you have to see

405
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,200
that this paint is dry to be able to migrate

406
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
to the other  for Another Station So

407
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,470
imagine that I do this at the end of the

408
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,410
process, it's going to be bad because some

409
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,520
cars I put in chips,

410
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,800
others no I can stain the paint

411
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,180
then I'll imagine I do

412
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,620
something with wet paint then I

413
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,160
realize only at the end.  I have to dry the

414
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,830
quality controls, I have to

415
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,570
play more and more, it's not for the beginning,

416
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,630
so that things come out right, it's

417
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,000
so there's no problem, because we

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,740
you know how much of a problem being a car

419
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,180
comes out of a treadmill on an

420
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,310
assembly line with a problem so the sooner

421
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,360
I fix it the better and it's no wonder that a

422
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,430
treadmill like this that is extremely

423
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,400
computerized is totally drivable.

424
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,610


425
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,740
we've already seen it, I have

426
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,690
a screen here with several Magic

427
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,340
which I ended up taking to reduce a

428
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,920
little Presentation but that way I

429
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
can't just spit a lot of

430
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
cars on the market and say, let me see

431
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,680
that there's an error and we'll fix it, it doesn't have

432
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,079
to  throwing back the beginning of the process

433
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,020
that's what we talk about shift-left is

434
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,290
bringing it to the beginning as soon as possible

435
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,530
is going to us

436
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,690
is the most real vision right now we

437
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,470
talk a lot about vaccines is the topic of the moment

438
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,540
and everyone  interested in the vaccination process, they

439
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,270
'll think about the production ball,

440
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,700
right now, we know it

441
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,680
well, but every day we don't know much about

442
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,200
the vaccine production process, right,

443
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,420
imagine that iphan came to China

444
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,190
we are seeing a lot of this function, which has

445
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,840
to be imported, ifan from China has arrived.

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,670


447
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,020


448
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,750


449
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,760


450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,260
it's the preparation, the

451
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,270
labeling of the vials, then you have to

452
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,880
pack them with jellal, cool and take them for

453
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,690
transport. Imagine that a batch of 1

454
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,670
million vaccines arrives only in the State of São

455
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,020
Paulo. They found out that the

456
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,200
hypha was not very

457
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,659
good, so it's the  Same thing when we

458
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,700
talk about a development treadmill,

459
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,279
I can't just run the risk

460
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,740
that my final product is bad, I

461
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,389
have to bring all

462
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,299
quality control to the beginning of this treadmill, the

463
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,820
start of this production, which in this case

464
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,429
guarantees that the iphan is  there is

465
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,860
no problem with the vaccine no

466
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,529
matter how many errors happen and you can give

467
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,720
a batch of vaccine that is bad some

468
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,630
other vaccine that is bad I need to

469
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,260
ensure as little as possible  It's a mistake to

470
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,029
throw everything at the beginning of the process when

471
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,919
we talk about development therapy, it

472
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,440
's the same thing Yeah I like to give these

473
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,539
playful examples it's because even because

474
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,850
working with sales I need to bring

475
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,710
some real life events for our

476
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,960
client to understand and obviously  What do you

477
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,090
think about security with Paula, interact? You

478
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,130
don't understand a lot of the development mat,

479
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,510
we have to stay in

480
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,090
their heads in an easy way,

481
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,600
as was mine to learn.

482
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,180


483
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,540


484
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,730
Say it is as soon as possible in the process

485
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,110
and then how does the agent do it to

486
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,140
automate Let's think

487
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,510
about pet management, right level

488
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,670
Initial, here's me treadmill I have

489
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,110
all the phases of my treadmill that

490
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,440
starts with the build modification planning,

491
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,990
right when you know the image Go  To be approved

492
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,530
then I have, right, I'll deliver

493
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,320
this image. Anyway, it all goes and comes back,

494
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,600
right? Then I'll correct the errors as

495
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,890
I correct and improve  praying my

496
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,020
image I'm killing the contains in this

497
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,970
production and the cousins happy with the

498
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,010
new image then automated process

499
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,740
And remember that I said only a dozen or

500
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,420
hundreds of images that will become

501
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,360
hundreds or thousands of containers so

502
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,190
this has to be done in a way

503
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,160
automated and just like an

504
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,740
automobile assembly line, if I have the

505
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,860
bad process badly done there at the beginning, it will

506
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,510
impact my entire production line

507
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,570
and it may be that they arrive in lot

508
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,830
10, everything I will have to do Recall

509
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,260
and it will be expensive to see  sticks

510
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,390
because it's the concessionaire who pays, but

511
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,760
who will pay for a treadmill like this is the

512
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,350
application that will have insurance, the company

513
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,720
that will suffer Attack on the user who will,

514
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,020
is this information leaked or there will be a

515
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,080
transaction hijacked at the end, we

516
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,490
can also help  here about

517
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,810
problems that we can have in an

518
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,240
application that is moderated So how

519
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,980
can we automate the

520
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,800
process standing between "level 11

521
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,010
Well, let's go then q  When I have on

522
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,110
my treadmill at bild time

523
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,420
this image will be real and will be

524
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,520
presented to the world before they are

525
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,550
container then the smart Scan

526
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,190
of image vulnerabilities I can't

527
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,100
think about security later at the end of the

528
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,780
process  because, more or less, as the

529
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,970
vaccine can be late when I talk about

530
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,170
a car, I still have a

531
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,180
financial and logistical cost to be able to make

532
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,500
a Recall when I talk about a vaccine.

533
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,690


534
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,360


535
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,970
this can't be an error so let's

536
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,360
stick it in the park Lage as well as the

537
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,500
skewer is drying tests for

538
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,650
example code I'll also wait for a rest

539
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,910
honorability Oops I'll find the

540
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,860
vulnerability and I'll rebuild

541
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,630
these images That is, I found

542
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,030
vulnerability fix it  pass the bibiu of

543
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,000
these images and apply the

544
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,779
side pets when this application

545
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,349
is an image piece of code and

546
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,239
obviously if you have a container

547
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,700
in production  It's with this image that I

548
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,289
found vulnerabilities I can

549
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,659
replace and obviously talking about

550
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,429
hundreds of units I need my

551
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,649
blender to do this so

552
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,950
again orchestrator glasses go and

553
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,359
provision making images all and

554
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,659
automated so it seems very simple

555
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,700
because whoever works can  if he's already

556
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,200
used to sticking

557
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,690
several control points

558
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,169
on the treadmill as well as on an automobile production treadmill

559
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,929
so let's go to level 2, right next

560
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:22,479
step, always using taking advantage

561
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,549
of automation I stuck a ladder a

562
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,859
skill I made the level of the images

563
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,139
that will need to be  corrected I did the

564
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,940
replacement of the containers that were

565
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,440
in production were running they

566
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,330
were vulnerable because discovering

567
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,179
another one is already here at risk it was already at the

568
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,339
end of the wait at risk but if I

569
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:41,259
found out that there was a problem back there

570
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,789
for everyone but it contains it in the

571
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:46,190
E  then it means that I will put

572
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,470
the drying process at the beginning of the

573
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,700
bed  ra doesn't mean that

574
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,440
it's there and the production is safe it's not

575
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,309
killing and being born again so the next

576
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,960
step that I can also add to the

577
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,350
mix is an admission control,

578
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,789
that is not to let

579
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,389
vulnerable images be implemented.

580
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,489
playa das né long Portuguese a

581
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,190
very horrible translation is I can

582
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,590
control that they are not used

583
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,779
What is the risk of that I can

584
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,239
stop applying it widely but then the idea

585
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:24,109
is to create it's tourniquet rules that

586
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,849
go up and down the bar according to  the

587
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,129
happiness of my application and saying

588
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:30,529
that I don't accept, for example, more

589
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:33,470
than X is critical vulnerabilities And then

590
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,389
I can not Deploy a

591
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,249
vulnerability into a forgiveness of an

592
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,619
image that has many abilities and

593
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,539
obviously had I'll stop application I'll

594
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,950
stop  in the business but I'm not going to

595
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,800
put my business

596
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,680
and on the internet, for example, it would be difficult

597
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,400
for everyone to attack So the

598
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,990
images are already there, right I was able to

599
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,840
address this problem  motto obviously it

600
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,520
's not the panacea for all problems

601
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm talking about some tips here that

602
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,510
you can take advantage of automation and

603
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,080
here we'll talk about another problem.

604
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,290


605
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,840


606
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,300
if everything is created it is copied

607
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,340
So why am I going to create

608
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,170
some hall codes from scratch I need

609
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,750
a load balancer solution why

610
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,100
am I going to take mine if I can

611
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,020
just use an

612
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,780
existing image and readjust a wing or

613
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,930
reused then there is  Doca's repository,

614
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,270
right, with more than 4 million

615
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,880
images and that many people use the

616
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
images and in an automated way, right

617
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,560
Smart, also there in the Doc, it

618
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,870
will bring an image, see it, it will

619
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,850
play in production without being that

620
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,779
one happens that a

621
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,399
the search masses 4 million images and

622
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,210
more than 6,500 and almost 6 thousand five hundred

623
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,190
to give one images found in this

624
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,059
set of 4 million has a

625
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,129
crypto-miner for two that wants  to say it's an

626
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,649
image that's vulnerable that I'm a

627
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,649
developer or developer I'm going

628
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,479
to use this code that was

629
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,099
available to the environment I'm going to

630
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,109
use it's not an application I'm going to

631
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,759
Deploy my application with the

632
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,190
vulnerability and this image can be

633
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,719
a threat that  will start to mine

634
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,210
Bitcoin, for example, any that you coin

635
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,700
in the environment but maybe it won't

636
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,139
steal information, okay it won't

637
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,899
steal data any resource that is as

638
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,080
critical as one side because the bill

639
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,999
will arrive at the end of the month so it's common

640
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,479
if this  Resource theft attack is

641
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,359
becoming more and more common and the concern

642
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,969
of Claudio's administrator administrator

643
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,039
is not only information theft, it's

644
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,789
also the bulge of resource

645
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,779
that's it, did it exist?

646
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,749


647
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,940


648
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,019
known ie the

649
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,840
fifth of these images they would go

650
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,840
unnoticed ie the fifth of these

651
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,749
6500 images they do not scandium

652
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:08,179
durability it  s would pass beauties and

653
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,859
even so they would install crypto

654
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,200
miner in the environment Fantastic

655
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,139
right then what does that mean at the

656
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,879
time I just gave a solution and now

657
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,830
comes with a problem here deny everything I

658
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,499
just said don't calm down the clerk

659
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,960
Durability is necessary A  difference is

660
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,220
that now you need a new

661
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,679
approach, right. Do the dynamic image scam

662
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,590
and I'll talk about it just

663
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,749
concluding here that you took it from the

664
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:35,929
toilet and said that

665
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,840
many images found it with malicious images and

666
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,080
that you knew a static analysis

667
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,800
of traditional vulnerability

668
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,980
is normal and they would pass they will pass

669
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,380
I go admission control they would be

670
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,160
diplo ed with a mining clip

671
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,410
so the way to detect it is to do an

672
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,160
analysis of these images in the non-time That

673
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,020
is, it's the same thing that I found that

674
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,810
a vaccine  it's not working after

675
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,640
I applied it to a crowd, it's not cool to

676
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,710
do that and when we talk about

677
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,980
application, right? It's more or less

678
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,050
them  esmo So how can I do

679
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,020
a chemistry analysis of these images I

680
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,240
will comment on this but just to

681
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
illustrate here is another article from

682
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,760
another company talking about other things and

683
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,090
the person says exactly the

684
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,360
same theme as the image.  in its

685
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,220
original form it doesn't have any

686
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,460
malicious binary but at runtime it

687
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,830
neurotime it programmed to download one

688
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,800
our then what happens the image

689
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,630
sometimes it goes unharmed but it language

690
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,779
middle of execution

691
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:46,119
the male content that installed in its

692
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,299
environment take licious then  how to do

693
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:50,889
that right now let's go to level 3

694
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,080
hard level here

695
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,869
vulnerability rest then again

696
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:00,009
using automation i need to stick

697
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,960
security controls in your room online

698
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,349
then again vulnerability scan or

699
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,210
static durability scan that i

700
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,159
had been doing until  so dynamic

701
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,440
vulnerability scan what is this i

702
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,159
run in bild phase at bild time

703
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,210
a dynamic analysis i simulate

704
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,669
hum ti  me in dynamic analysis and I still

705
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,379
don't understand why this is the

706
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:26,139
sandbox I have a sandbox to

707
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,629
simulate a production environment run

708
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:30,609
this image as if it were a

709
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,649
production environment and analyze the behavior of

710
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,159
your image so that's a concept  what

711
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,649
you need to bring to your environment

712
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,279
is I don't know who does it for

713
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,789
free but you ok

714
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,639
I like to do it manually or

715
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:49,340
look for a corporate solution but it is

716
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,529
extremely critical that you know the

717
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,809
behavior of an image at

718
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,940
runtime too if you  not being able to

719
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,909
bring it to the bild you need to be

720
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,129
extremely careful and then start

721
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:03,799
monitoring what is happening and go to the team because

722
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,239
something may go wrong

723
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,679
I'm going to have dinner there even if you

724
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,090
have done the vulnerability analysis site

725
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,529
as documenting the  a

726
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:15,200
team it can't be forgotten and then

727
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,809
you follow the same path, right but the

728
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:19,729
pet rebuild of the subjective images

729
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:22,609
contains the adm control  This is so

730
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,739
obviously that I'm saying that I

731
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,019
also signal two controls that are

732
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,139
actively simple, right, so you can take

733
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:33,559
advantage of automation since they are

734
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,599
controls that you can stick in your

735
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,940
father and every time an image

736
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,389
goes through the bild phase it  is each and

737
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:43,800
it will or will not be approved,

738
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,370
your record is so when

739
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,340
we talk about automation, right at the beginning,

740
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,350
I wanted to make it clear that automation

741
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,350
when done badly is dangerous. So

742
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,090
imagine I have an image that has

743
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,070
a  critical vulnerability and I do

744
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,460
after this image and this one and a half hour

745
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,860
that is pain due to a sleeve of

746
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,680
my application makes a high scale and I

747
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,580
grow widely I'm increasing the

748
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,650
attack surface like this tremendously

749
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,380
and in an uncontrolled way because the auto

750
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,720
scaling is  an advantage of this type of

751
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,910
application and medical work, if I have a

752
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,330
problem, it will be the big problem on

753
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,040
the upper left side of my problem.

754
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,350


755
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,570
If you talk about automating

756
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,590
the problem, then it's a way to make

757
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,030
an application, a computational way that's here

758
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,810
to stay, okay Yeah, and here I'm

759
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,129
talking about

760
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,879
a security control theory that

761
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,070
you can do in your application in your

762
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,159
parent e Line precisely  in your bild and

763
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,710
so the maturity leap of your

764
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,840
application when you do this is huge

765
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,289
and to my surprise it's when I started

766
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:00,669
what I came to this market Look here

767
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:02,469
coming from personal security a little more

768
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,719
neurotic But this is the least that

769
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,269
everyone does  don't do it I say but there

770
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,450
are large companies that are extremely

771
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,369
mature in security for some things

772
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,009
and quite immature when we

773
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,919
talk about cloud application there is that

774
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,789
false sense of security every day I'm

775
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:23,589
going I'm on other people's computers I

776
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:26,649
'm there at WS  at Edna Google, that is,

777
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:28,509
security, they are responsible, not

778
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:31,349
security, there is a

779
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,849
shared responsibility, so a

780
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:36,039
large part of this responsibility is

781
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,549
yours, right?  nt consumer of the cloud and

782
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,479
obviously its responsible developer

783
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,789
is

784
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:47,330
the applications So this is a way for

785
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,769
you to start to get along with your

786
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,619
security manager your siso right offer

787
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,809
go man there's automation everything I do

788
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,879
automated a security take

789
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,619
you'll get  to reach the middle term

790
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,470
there security she is a catalyst she

791
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,049
is not a blocker I really like

792
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:05,389
that example Cliché I know it's a

793
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,940
cliché but those who haven't seen it can start

794
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,809
repeating around it makes a lot of sense that

795
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,909
security is like a car brake today

796
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:15,559
we can run at high

797
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,789
speeds because we have good

798
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:19,609
brakes, right, so the car brake is not

799
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:20,929
happy for us to give it to us to

800
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:23,960
stop, we need to be able to run the same thing

801
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,119
safety is a catalyst so as I

802
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,080
said it's just the beginning there are many,

803
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,970
many  other features you

804
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,309
can think of many other controls

805
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:36,739
you can bring environment person many

806
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,419
of these controls you can

807
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,879
manually do many of  these controls

808
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:43,800
you can do with an Open Source solution,

809
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,230
good so security is also

810
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,120
considered very expensive security doesn't need to

811
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,150
dry security has to be just very

812
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,420
well thought out and planned there are

813
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,880
simple things that don't cost anything and people

814
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,060
don't even think about use

815
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,400
a password with a special character a

816
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,120
password a sport or an account trigger

817
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,040
the credentials use multi lack of

818
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,090
authentication is to make the privilege the

819
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,570
least privilege is possible so

820
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,470
I'm talking about basic security concepts,

821
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,060
right then we don't need to

822
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,020
talk about security  of a team and

823
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,460
automated virtual

824
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,620
pet microsegmentation to contain them I'm talking about

825
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,230
basic and this is not done and the hunting

826
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,640
effect more know here is security is

827
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,680
a world in Claudio's world is

828
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,660
growing more and more and obviously

829
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,810
when you think about developing

830
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,779
some strategy in

831
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,379
the wind of security think that today you

832
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:48,879
can have a tiny environment that

833
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,739
you treat the law m  it works

834
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:52,599
very well annually only you take care of security

835
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,029
and thank you very well but

836
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:56,619
cloud applications they tend to grow very

837
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,539
quickly because the technology

838
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,059
allows so you always have to think

839
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,580
of solutions or strategies that meet

840
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,039
the multi-cloud model and have one  The model

841
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,219
is also multi workload because

842
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,260
companies today are increasingly

843
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,879
using half of the application in a

844
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,589
cloud, half The other half of a penis

845
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:17,739
on the other side my cousin and I also

846
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,359
have some features that I

847
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,190
use another container that uses

848
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,679
servers in the functions  another part of the

849
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,329
application that I work with

850
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,389
virtual machines so for each type of

851
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,059
function you need you work with a

852
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,309
different type of workload so it's important to

853
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:36,849
think about this kind of broader approach.

854
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,899


855
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:43,359


856
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:43,790


857
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,699
and you can't go without talking about the

858
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:49,190
product, right, my commercial Pit goes here

859
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,820
so for you as some tips  of

860
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,580
free open-source solutions many that

861
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,310
you can also wake up in your upline

862
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,500
there to bring more security to your

863
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,920
environment so the first one is

864
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,010
Oops back here tripify which is the

865
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,900
vulnerability scan maintained by water

866
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,720
it is award-winning widely used

867
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,280
I have  I'm sure many of you have

868
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,110
heard of Twitter and already use

869
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,120
Twitter so it is fully integrated with

870
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,510
the CS solution you can use

871
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,270
to scan your images what the

872
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,940
tooth is a solution that will make

873
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,220
drying benchmark sweets in your environment

874
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,620
kubernetes  if benchmark by those who don't

875
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,490
know is a framework of best practices

876
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,220
then there is the west mark for various

877
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,370
types of services and technologies and

878
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,380
these recommendations are pages and

879
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,800
pages

880
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,170
of temptations recommendations payment if

881
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,810
you can automate automation again

882
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,640
you can do this in a way  much

883
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,500
simpler here, I have an option to

884
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,840
think if for you to test your

885
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,260
Kubernetes environments there is a sun

886
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,020
ution also open source for kubernetes which is

887
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,560
what gunter is a solution that has

888
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,810
testing to charge this so then i'll

889
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,850
find vulnerabilities in your clan if

890
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,890
our city hall orchestrator i'll

891
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,530
say that it would be there vulnerable to

892
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,260
an exploit to attack then one more

893
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,370
automated testing application

894
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,100
for your environment and lastly I'm going to

895
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,590
introduce you because there are so many

896
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,560
open-source projects there in the Rubi kit or

897
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,970
on the water site itself that you can

898
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,450
download to test and after help you can

899
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,150
talk to us here  also and that I

900
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,010
support this last tip which is a

901
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,650
solution that will do an

902
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,780
automated check is of the posture of your cloud

903
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,510
good so the Smart document system for

904
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,600
kubernetes I will run for several

905
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,460
other cloud services that you may

906
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,130
have enabled And I will say  look that you

907
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,520
didn't use encryption you didn't

908
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,140
use a lot of authentication factor here

909
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,640
there's an open service that shouldn't

910
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,440
so it's really cool for you to take it off  a

911
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,750
picture of your environment with very

912
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,410
nice and friendly tools and not only these in

913
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,120
Others so many there that you can download

914
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,310
to integrate our treadmill then

915
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,040
finally enjoy I'll let this

916
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,660
create Cold that is for you to try for

917
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,600
free, right.

918
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,100
cloud that I commented to do this great

919
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,530
vulnerability You are dynamic of

920
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,270
vulnerability unfortunately you do not have a

921
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,580
strong penis to offer but I have

922
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,460
15 days for you to test so you can

923
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,250
get an idea of how your environment is,

924
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,750
how you are treating the

925
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,240
security of  images of you and I'll

926
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,520
also leave some references, right, the

927
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
post I commented on are the ones that are really

928
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,420
cool and not only this one by Claudio here,

929
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:43,790
but there

930
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,060
's what's really cool to print on

931
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,460
that one here.

932
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,610


933
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,430
informative if you are seeing any

934
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,470
similarity with something you

935
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,920
've heard from Liz Rizzi There is, yes, I

936
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,540
used a lot of this presentation

937
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,360
it that I share with you about

938
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,570
orchestration is from Caldeira applications and

939
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,270
just take advantage of it and to which I

940
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,400
leave the link to the open-source

941
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,580
water projects In case you are interested and

942
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,250
want to think it was a test

943
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,490
and as well as the message for everyone  I

944
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,600
let us always think about

945
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,860
continuous integration continuous

946
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,200
delivery I think it's important for us to

947
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,770
think about continued healing It

948
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,460
seems like advertising a

949
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,700
marketing phrase But that's just it,

950
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,470
cloud applications are here to

951
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,800
stay,

952
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,530
roads are here to stay  they

953
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,190
bring many benefits and they have

954
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,430
enormous growth power and everything

955
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,090
that we can't control and

956
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,100
grows in a disorderly way is a

957
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,590
problem for everyone so let's

958
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,060
bring it Let's take advantage of this

959
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,030
automation instead of going out there.

960
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,860
in an

961
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,250
ungoverned way is as much control

962
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,230
as you can stick in your father

963
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,710
Pilar and make that leave my contacts

Hi Carol sensational Thank you

974
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,920
for your time, I'll take advantage of the fact that

975
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,920
we are finishing here and I already

976
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,720
have a point that the sensational that they

977
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,880
open-source projects, we are at

978
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,310
the community event here, right,

979
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,200
you need not scheduled this, but we

980
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,300
are at an event talking about community,

981
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,400
right, the old one and spoke during the event

982
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,160
about the importance of the community in

983
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,350
helping to educate and train

984
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,830
people at the safety bar, right.

985
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,510
Divina has to talk about the CPF

986
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,120
like this  It also helped in

987
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,790
her study process, right? I think the

988
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,070
community can contribute a lot to the project about

989
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,810
partners, I became a

990
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,420
project advocate, right?  er happy to see TAM,

991
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,340
right And mostly we're talking about

992
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,500
there are posting about an event that is

993
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,850
part of a number out there called

994
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,310
reaching them and Eva what the security area

995
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,470
