1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,830
and say your good afternoon, all right and

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,570
thank you for the opportunity here first

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,389
to the people from the Village. I will be

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,000
talking to you on Saturday tomorrow

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,939
we in this life and today to have spoken so

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,939
it is very interesting I said that

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,609
I have used this inclusion a lot in the months

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,910
that  it's pa cura and it's to eat

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,100
even if you think about it because of its tool

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,170
developed by a company

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,070


12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,010


13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,600


14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,500


15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,140
what is this

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,590
is opaque and is a tool workshop

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,550
was not too late focused to attack

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,960
four per voice is to become a

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,800
cloud computing provider in this case WS

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,369
make up the stage For now it is focused

21
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,550
only on WS does not have support  a download

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,619
What she works and thinks is also

23
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,830
not in the plans of the accommodated people who

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,090
are contributing with pacu to export the

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,040
other Which is likely, maybe I didn't see

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,250
anything in relation to this, nobody's land

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,330
of  les and not one in the chats that has

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,300
personal time in this Green it was

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,289
initially developed by a

30
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,170
security company since laughing or

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,510
following it if self iq

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,090
and the ticket to comb this one in the

33
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,780
United States so they were seeing

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,820
that many knew Jaque  I'll

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,240
do a job before you know if the day

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,210
I can go with them respect your son

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,520
was related to this I was migrating

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,770


39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,900
to talking about illness many people are cursing me

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
already arriving with the consulted to

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,730
improve And for this to make you close

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,610
there in  which So this one, or this

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,770
need, and developed this

44
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,460
internally, then it is used as one

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,480
or more project partners. It is open source

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,850
and it is very easy to contribute later.

47
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,770


48
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,030


49
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,210
from

50
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,370
Parkour Hi what's up

51
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,549
and he has something you say he

52
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,870
was in love with you this is page 222

53
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,299
she's going to see here as you can see

54
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,890
here there are things from 26 days that  and it's the same

55
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,510
time this week to do it I did a

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,920
numbering module I of service ow

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,040
more he called from behind the Freio there

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,450
so now he's always looking to see if

59
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,150
you've been commenting on the public I think

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,160
it's an age rubbish some

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,040
improvements to be retired  that already comes

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,379
from the community of people who

63
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,629
are used to buy and carry out

64
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,510
the intrusion tests

65
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,210
we

66
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,790
are from the end of the system that you

67
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,150
use and I also found the goal because

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,340
there are several and

69
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,410
there are several tools to do this

70
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,840
job of making a  Long stem and infusion test

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,519
approved some

72
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,099
support free Google laugh

73
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,670
oculus to ships and so on I just

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,030
missed something more focused on a probable one in

75
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,060
this case from Greece also has some

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,139
clients that was from violence and

77
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,759
the term was focused  in WS it means to

78
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,669
me that the guys know the broth for

79
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,310
several knows and services know the

80
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,370
flaws these may have how to explore

81
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,729
them to see common in Uberaba even this

82
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,180
if  rvice that are there so there's

83
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,009
nothing left, right It's good that you have a

84
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,409
tool I accepted it's all in a nice one

85
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:46,999
around it but it's opaque it came in handy to

86
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,719
do intrusion tests there on

87
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:54,469
old Amazon I use it a lot some

88
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,569
things that called me  his attention here

89
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:01,389
it is very similar to metasploit

90
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,090
so it was like this when i started

91
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,870
there says he did the first test

92
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,650
o and victor is a lot I think there is a

93
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,530
lot of inspiration here from esports i use

94
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,990
these photos a lot sometimes kiss us for

95
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,650
this c&a i've already talked around  air liked

96
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,980
the way it was developed right

97
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,930
and he Hermes he didn't go there knows writing

98
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,750
you have it almost well written it has

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,560
little space but well written well

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,590
mobilized it has for those who have already

101
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,570
developed something for python and

102
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,050
django  works in

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,240
relation to Pets now that

104
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,950
Planet Planet concept you can develop

105
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,340
package mode a parent so plugged in to give

106
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,800
a convention on it established for the

107
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,530
day now there by I'll go by  cause of

108
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,710
Ice to develop the package for the Goal there

109
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,350
so you will be lacking for you to be

110
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,990
used the same thing for healing so

111
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,820
it has this concept of real estate

112
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,120
What is very interesting is very easy to

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,210
understand how it works It

114
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,470
also developed here is a pot Used all  the

115
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,840
modules that are run, the cell

116
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,820
restarts you can use it to

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,490
do your test so I also think you don't

118
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,520
like attention it's not difficult but

119
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,689
also transport

120
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,279
is very difficult developed a new mode

121
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,899
if they have a template for you to

122
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,619
follow  This time is And then it uses that time

123
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:50,389
in which the fast mode was developed is in

124
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,569
English

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
and it does not support all regions of the

126
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,940
water in this is not something that a little

127
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,780
owes them from Pacu because they have some

128
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,810
regions, for example Machine, right they

129
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,449
they never worked so they will even

130
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,770
know about the resources that exist, right, that

131
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,319
can be adapted in China so it's

132
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,900
difficult to develop things for this

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,030
region because of that and for other issues as

134
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,490
well.  and there's a big

135
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,639
China Firewall that blocks everything we

136
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,229
suffer from outside output too, so

137
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,009
there's this layer there that has

138
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,409
n't been implemented here yet, it's paid for,

139
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:42,189
but that's it, it's really good to use if it's

140
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,819
very fast and good.  useful to do you're

141
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,849
doing a test and

142
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,000
What did you find there I'm going

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,139
to WS credential leaking there son want to see

144
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,080
that that differential has access to

145
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,310
these services that credential has

146
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,360
permission from me ok the guy will get it I

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,979
thanked something creation in the mess to try

148
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,960
remove as much information as

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,930
possible as quickly as possible that's

150
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,030
another thing really quick essential

151
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,510
in a session and save the equations and you've

152
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,830
collected either

153
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,800
a specific service or various

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,430
services from Travessa,

155
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,340
Tom picked it up, we'll start going to do it

156
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,039
today  ok police, I have already done the com with

157
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,260
this repository that I imagine

158
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,330
everyone should know how to

159
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,470
paste, right? So I just put this URL here

160
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,620
and in the terminal and paste the price with  to a

161
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,620


162
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
unicorn and see if it will download all the

163
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,970
spoken code from this Range And then it will create

164
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,680
a directory in the knife directory

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,089
within the Lord you business here Saco

166
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,200
Grande involved with the father you

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,190
select father with three now so you

168
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,660

talking to parents  on the station ends up

177
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,459

180
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,559
I'm going to the project I use.

181
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,379


182
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,850


183
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,220
brand's virtual directory

184
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,139
clinging I told you to go to

185
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:13,799
the Pálio so Virtual's climate part

and como pay 13 used it on vive And creates

189
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,779
a virtual environment within this

190
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,710
directory here in this too Dobrev

191
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,379
the bread done this

192
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,019
call me here I'll press

193
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,849
we do it again you have to

194
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,309
enable the scarf virtual environment

195
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,829
Because that audio and Update the  virtual money

196
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,910


197
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,170
Hi and then after this step here of

198
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,210
creating the directory there that has all the

199
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,650
configuration that can work the

200
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,800
environment that only from Paiva you together

201
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,010
strong mine can be done up

202
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,090
here so I'm going out here I've been showing

203
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:07,230
private TVs I saw this  textual So

204
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,570
I was going to start wheels invasion

205
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,020
you told me number is this one I

206
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,690
was using my water staff I

207
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,660
knew it was vacuum so there's a problem and

208
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,210
now I'm going to install it independently I

209
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,030
tell you this is almost

210
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,100
sad this file Record  Excel

211
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,530
is where the project's dependencies are located,

212
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,590
right? Every passion and

213
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,260
Independence project follows this convention or in

214
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,260
any chess piece on top there's

215
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,210
this one for me almost  and this one comes

216
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,010
almost because you have a dependency it

217
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,610
needs to be installed you run

218
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,410
the software for me is a gift from

219
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,150
then

220
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,830
And in the case here and list After all what is

221
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,700
title letters and Girl was the

222
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,370
dependencies that have as a service to this

223
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,730
one  prevent any dependency

224
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,520
from being injected into the project

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,060
so now also if the people

226
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,190
start there,

227
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,010
we have the Japanese installed, everything is

228
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,470
fine, I'm starting to use the

229
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,430
college so if you said it via

230
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,550
pi pi, you'll start the boss foto

231
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,190
pacu  and people and God will start you

232
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,820
Wagner commands, if not if you installed

233
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,750
the things, I'll be using it in a little while, I'm using it

234
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,080
if you want to put this file here.

235
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,170


236
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,350


237
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,910


238
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,730
buy me

239
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,610
already watched i already start searching the

240
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,820
screen games happening fire down

241
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,760
the prayer here has one here would go there and if

242
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,530
you're peak joy i'll

243
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,370
just execute a pact if not if i installed in

244
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,260
eat i just finished  make a

245
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,080
central repository of the dependencies business that makes

246
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,890
sensitive and the father is wide

247
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,059
Hi and then it starts up

248
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,999
and it's my fault I advise that one

249
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:47,919
so here right away it gets out of this

250
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,499
body that I have a mess on my

251
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:53,289
computer it has a base of  data that

252
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:56,319
the proposal I taught and to store

253
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:00,849
the Test data, all the data are

254
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:04,869
saved in various locations was done with esc

255
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:08,439
like So there is a peace settings.py file

256
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,939
inside the pacu project I have

257
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:14,889
absolute pef for this one for this bank, right

258
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:19,329
because I think  it's me Mr crazy the check

259
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,369
something bag don't stay on that side

260
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:22,859
but what can i get here showing

261
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:26,349
but all the data that you persist

262
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,599
from a test will be vaccinated in this

263
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,999
base and it was made with this one What's

264
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,209
wide so i forgot you  it will be

265
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,949
next week because he already let

266
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,070
me have

267
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,860
the boat installed on mine on my

268
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,440
computer so he asks if i

269
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,910
want i have you Santa

270
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,520


271
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,480
I go so I asked why

272
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,370
I want to use a new session or if

273
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,990
you want to start our session so

274
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,630
I want to use a session for

275
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,130
existing ones so if we

276
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,010
are here ours are I will not use

277
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,690
I will not effectively use national Keys

278
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,100
silenced better explained that his

279
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,870
works So my account right there because

280
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,230
sometimes production so I don't have

281
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,150
time to sit a new

282
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,800
feature to do this so I

283
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,910
'm going to come back here just

284
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,070
walk through the tool and

285
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,860
try to explain how to use  the

286
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,980
tool to work with the princess

287
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,630
good so here I'm going to enter Our mother-in-law

288
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,420
because I 0

289
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,940
and she asks what is the name I

290
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,760
want to give to this session This is this is

291
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
this is interesting this also I think

292
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,420
is well expected at Marcos Góes  right he

293
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,470
this session of hers I'll try a

294
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,650
nickname for this session And then if I go

295
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,280
home I'm working the train I'm reading on the

296
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,290
test and I found two two

297
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,540
WS credentials But and the same c  liente within the same

298
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,810
Near inclusion is being carried out

299
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,380
so I can take these two of

300
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,050
these bloody ones these two parents let him

301
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,300
know it's this and created Difference Stations

302
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
and I can keep switching sessions

303
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,900
according to what was executed between, it's

304
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,970
not between  it's written in the text

305
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,050
well so it's important to have names that

306
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,050
make sense for the work you

307
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,829
were doing so it has names

308
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:53,709
like x ex Silas and etc. later it will be

309
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,870


310
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,310


311
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:03,970
it's

312
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,260
joy so I want to see your guard like

313
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,890
that but that was for you I'll give you a

314
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,819
name would be fine and

315
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,780
the beauty of this maid is

316
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,929
G1

317
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:31,720
and after that I need to select or

318
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,570
keep the keys the credentials I

319
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,749
found from WS So who's already

320
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:42,289
used to them some other

321
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,929
utilities every time he is

322
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,559
seated bothered the violence

323
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,029
knows what works remember it's a pair of

324
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:57,710
keys 15 here in powder here so it's just

325
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,820
this key  that you will have to inform,

326
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,340
mainly to be able to keep

327
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,309


328
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,639
an exploration of the time when Marcos has the

329
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,740
key, so,

330
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,990
and needing it here, I

331
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,090
do not have keys selected I do not have

332
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,750
Keys save the settings So you

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,780
have to save Keys in  command that I

334
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,929
'll call you for this is a always wanted mode

335
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,429
that I'll use to run They are

336
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:33,090
a point is module 7 15 so sure did

337
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,550
I'll put them again for me

338
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,060
Keys and won

339
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,720
and see the

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,510
and so don't you think it's ide and it is  what

341
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,450
he brings the snakes from Forró in this,

342
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,860
so you can use the other one, ok WS

343
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,140
o use make calls using a

344
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,500
registered master to do something

345
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,590
related get sick see for me open

346
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,200
here to have fun here

347
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,090
the new I think in this concept  of

348
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,669
Fashion tokens, right You can create a

349
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:27,649
key that is temporary and that will

350
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,200
have a little bit to expire

351
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,070
all the famous ones that were made

352
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,400
to give you so

353
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,050
what if you created your  the key with this one with

354
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,660
this feature So you'll have

355
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,370
a little and see if it was here in case

356
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,200
I don't have it because I'm typing here to

357
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,280
your son that this so I won't let it

358
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,610
go as it goes here it's good no

359
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,570
problem, just that  he deserves it The key

360
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,890
is so safe, right, everything is safe, the session is

361
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,150
safe o

362
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,320
So

363
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,399
and the key that used to make

364
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,360
calls to Avenida da

365
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,059
Violence is also sitting so

366
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,120
and now you too, I can start taking

367
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,259
the vows  I do the

368
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:33,259
training but before going to the modes I'll

369
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,480
spend a little bit here and each command on

370
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,919
this one try to explain how it works

371
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,129
so one thing is a list of commands,

372
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,470
right, not even similar to these ports

373
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,950
too And then the first one is the list this

374
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,279
garbage it will list or LS it will be in

375
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,129
all modes its present this version

376
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:59,330
you are using so according to it is

377
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,419
if it lists in something that comes back

378
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,669
an important feature that I also

379
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,730
don't let me see at the beginning is that the

380
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,200
modes are  divided by categories

381
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,789
so there are ways to

382
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,820
get involved laterals relate there is a

383
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,040
motorbike for evasion I saw

384
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,470
the module for recognition

385
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,590
certification is that it's bright and

386
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,160
several countries determined Soares gives a

387
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,270
message education has a module to

388
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,090
climb privilege right  these customers

389
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,210
have module for ex plode forget

390
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,440
actually found a vulnerability

391
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,620
in WS in your account of the same

392
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,290
thing you are testing so if

393
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,180
you want to explore this one,

394
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,630
yours have a writing mode three

395
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,180
chances for you to get data in this  if

396
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,310
here are three who download

397
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,210
a feast get the RDS Snapchat

398
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,260
for database service ships

399
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,360
download this one dangerous to

400
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,470
download and Death of the

401
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,840
Disco discs open Extra if you have a disc

402
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,490
Oh, yeah, yeah  that paying easy was

403
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,890
already huh, the fact is that you will have access, everything

404
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,580
has persistence modes, whether you are

405
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,390
able to explore and you want to keep

406
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,870
your access n  so there are ways to

407
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,640
do this to see S Paulo there are

408
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,559
modules here that can make this job

409
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,470
much easier

410
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,100
Hi and in several voices this voice to make

411
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,029
subtitles you are

412
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:59,549
and can go to the bar at this moment I do

413
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,149
n't know you cut it here but one

414
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,660
read more's good quality of service

415
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,660
is what I see are the services that

416
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,420
are heavier for those who are

417
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,110
starting to deal with violence if a company

418
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,060
is talking, I don't know.

419
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,160


420
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,440


421
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,110
usually these services here that

422
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,760
are here in the

423
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,880
resolver category it downloads that

424
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,290
people usually use in this 2 shows the

425
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,100
video the first one we are RDS too but

426
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,230
I believe that soon the support

427
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,550


428
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,160
for the majority of services that  do

429
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
service that I are considered

430
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,860
entry service for sale in my snag

431
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,890
They will be available here right I already

432
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,310
sent two the universe was this project

433
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,740
was the six This was for this one

434
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,730
two of one eye it was not accepted to get married

435
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm waiting for my personal experience to

436
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,470
get one more was this one to

437
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,300
make a variation of

438
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,880
the SDS database servers go to MDS

439
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,680
relational data servers

440
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,880
and this is the hosting and

441
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,730
classes service  inhaled WS that goes down from there I was

442
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,380
doing

443
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:38,750
or Pinterest And then I needed to retrieve

444
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,300
What were the databases that

445
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,750
were in that account at that time, then

446
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,430
you see that there was no going back to that

447
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,590
so

448
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,419
I just also made a focus of the project,

449
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,850
implemented it, tested it  and I've already sent people

450
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,340
there, accepted and I'm back, I'm bringing people, they don't

451
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,029
talk

452
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:04,049
the letter of the reasons I prefer to

453
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,650
clone the

454
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,280
repository or install dependencies when

455
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,260
centralizing what was really left, you

456
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,570
use pico you'll also have access to the

457
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,180
code, but when  you kona

458
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,100
goes out to create a Branch work on the roll

459
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,890
of the vo open the fort there to see the

460
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:30,640
West public and contribute to the project So

461
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,250
this problem the ears to use in

462
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,010
this way is enough  before the side, nor

463
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,640
that of

464
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,930
terrame and making changes that you want and

465
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,660
with it the modules It is better to have the code

466
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,180
is better leukosis there is a code there for the

467
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,530
law to try to see that a

468
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,170
certain mode is really making it understand and

469
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,450
execute it is important to do this too,

470
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,020
ok  It's good to go out running fashion without understanding

471
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,280
what you're doing and in the end you're lost

472
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,640
and healthy This was the rubbish I

473
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,780
went through at school so if you want it again

474
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,430
See the list of commands that are

475
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,090
available weak I won't give you a help and you

476
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,760
'll be saying again that  are

477
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,300
available here you run has this

478
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:34,080
pit here it is a it is a command

479
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,230
that is made for you to automate your

480
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,540
stuff so

481
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,280
And if I want to automate

482
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,010
and it will always be determined the modules of

483
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,190
my processes of my tests So

484
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,050
I can write a file that has

485
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,460
basically these commands

486
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,580
What passes the time Frank the name of

487
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,580
module 7 15 around and then I load

488
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,920
it they like these commands

489
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,750
so you don't miss this one  one of the more

490
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,200
advanced ones didn't want to go into too much

491
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,050
detail and here it ended up confusing him,

492
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,690
so it's better to start using

493
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,320
paid here inside the

494
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,420
tool's utility And then start

495
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,760
automating because then you understand you

496
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,470
know the tool and then the

497
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,140
location that I  all have tests I like

498
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,510
to make the couple easy to work, which is

499
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,280
possible but I think it's important

500
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,960
you know the base before doing the basics

501
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,230
before doing send me an audio

502
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,170
to understand how the dangerous works And

503
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,640
then you talk later automate

504
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,370
things I  not enough also its Rose

505
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,960
the fireplace today I'm going to talk about Iron

506
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm going to go back I'm going to use talcum I'm going there I

507
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,110
have this pop up it lists the

508
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,210
undetermined mobile packages of a

509
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,630
certain one or resources of the hawks

510
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,640
also or of a certain category of

511
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,820
slime so if you  want to know

512
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,029
what module for an ec2 resource is blue this

513
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:27,440
ec2 is

514
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,700
the WS computing service answer

515
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,519
payment has the distances vi  rtuals

516
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,659
there is usually to unite the applications, stay in a

517
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:44,600
row, drop the lottery so that one

518
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,669
shouted that he has it back, right then, in

519
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:49,730
the Scott category,

520
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,799
he has the persistence category that he has back in the country in

521
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,750
the Revelation category that he

522
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,230
has for that, so I can too

523
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:02,629
enter or category you want to know

524
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:06,680
that you can for S2

525
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:16,210
hum hum remember

526
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:23,700
the result oh what's up

527
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,000
And then

528
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,000


529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,530
the soap opera Sex

530
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,020
and then

531
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,990
the test explodes 1

532
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,200
I'll be

533
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,830
jealous and generate reason to see people go there to

534
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,850
understand did that  it's not working but

535
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,190
if you want to find a way for the

536
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,130
project and I chose this one right He

537
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,980
'll minister talking to be seen in this

538
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,970
one, there'll be everything related to

539
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,220
that particular service there at Braz

540
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,340
so for S3 there's only the S3

541
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,220
download banker at module  in this naming convention in

542
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,309
order to have these two

543
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,650
yeah I don't disagree here

544
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,160
I want it's weird right It's not far

545
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,320
from Morro do pai although the father contains

546
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,280
some drawings that have 21 efforts but

547
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,410
it's not common to see this in the name of rose that

548
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,900
the convention is Zap in cheese

549
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,630
so and to say that this is one of the school

550
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:53,540
is worth it so it is

551
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,770
and it doesn't stress gym I thought this

552
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,390
strange people said but it will be

553
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:05,420
important and there next  command is the

554
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,500
one and I've already talked to

555
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,730
him shows it

556
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,350
in a context of help Ralph's messages in

557
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,669
a certain way the command

558
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,760
to the street in May and if I went it's the same

559
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,930
and it has the same concept as the primary in the

560
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,830
blond hairs he says that that the  your

561
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,830
role user who is logged in the

562
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,620
any attention section that is here at the moment

563
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,210
so here he has a lot of things marked

564
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,850
as in because I haven't hesitated we

565
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:49,990
mentioned nor come back so he won't have

566
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,990
anything at the same time it's all but he's an

567
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,049
interesting command of

568
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,179
good to know it exists because sometimes

569
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,100
you've already said that you found two

570
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,220
leaked Amazon credentials so you

571
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,470
need to change the key, it's beautiful but it

572
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:14,220
's a release in one put this one and

573
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,230
download it from a PS3 bank What's the

574
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,570
difference then with  this here if you do

575
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,019
n't lose this one exactly what you

576
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,759
thought you're using Windows

577
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,379
you should convert someone cares

578
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,359
that the name makes sense for you to

579
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,850
lose to hide it's very interesting to

580
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,739
know that it

581
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:39,659
exists how it works  inside here how

582
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,179
you are going to use it does it to me that

583
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,470
all the time it

584
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,860
once you do I run module this

585
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,630
module Go to the page called na peidava

586
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:57,740
collects the necessary data and saves

587
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,530
this data in the lilacs database in

588
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,090
full here some data presented

589
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,159
by  what is used was a pacu and

590
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,490
So whenever you want to consult

591
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,240
this database, it doesn't have it, I ca

592
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,340
n't even seem like it's seen, it's also going

593
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,909
to run whenever I want to run this knowing what

594
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,890
has already been stored in this database, it made an

595
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,800
enumeration and distance  in this two there is

596
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,860
and I'll be able to know what I

597
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,620
have inside my base in a

598
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,200
certain inspection section that I

599
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,420
'm here, what has already been stored in the

600
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,050
bank, I just execute  Come on I tell me

601
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,800
the glitter I have adaptation they

602
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,520
are found WS there are some

603
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,290
retards at the time that hours

604
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,910
of session were created here go I haven't read it

605
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,390
so you want to know about the specific service

606
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,540
that I've been saving  from

607
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,290
the S2 the service you must walk minerals

608
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,280
that contain, for example, what I've already

609
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,159
done from the floor find WS so

610
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
I have information from the ec2 service

611
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,580
there's nothing to do with this So lay it down followed

612
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,880
by the do from the ec2 module so it doesn't have

613
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,780
water  and

614
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,840
I didn't do any I don't have time for it and

615
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,639
collections that we have to have action

616
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,570
answer nothing two it has a

617
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,929
dc2 module so real I don't know what it does it won't

618
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,520
bring anything but this guy he's the one

619
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,310
said you're going to run it  whenever you

620
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,370
want to see the history of your actions,

621
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,880
what you did is to see for me in

622
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,720
your illusion test

623
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,290
and for whom Service

624
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,370
and this service here is quite another thing to be the

625
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,940
next one we got you got a

626
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,790
key because we give it viral  what 

627
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,760
there's a lot of service I don't know your client uses

628
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,190
these two uses a shitload of delandia stove

629
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,820
calls a lot of bank and PS3

630
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,210
database will give a lot of RDS I got a lot of

631
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,750
a big account open So

632
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,660
this service here and you've been

633
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,730
working there was collections  things

634
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,280
were running I knew that the stage was

635
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,280
saved there if the database but

636
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,310
before the people got it

637
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,450
And how it was being collected And then you

638
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,810
want to know that there is service that

639
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,980
you have already collected in the

640
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,650
account in my city  running so he's

641
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,810
serious, that's a lot and that's why he'll

642
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,640
have to claim everything you've already collected

643
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,940
from Graça.

644
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,040


645
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,140


646
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,260
to continue doing so

647
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,310
that's it for me, there's what

648
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,230
I've already done, right, that he's

649
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,380
given you collected from two services that since

650
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,819
it was something you said

651
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:30,349
and these two things that will

652
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,829
delay us  walked the last has regi

653
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:40,309
tions public section create public call of it is

654
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,069
private but it is public there are regions that

655
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,190
have services for WS government are not

656
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,539
all regions and they are different and have

657
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,519
some different

658
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,349
characteristics of the product broth so if you

659
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,660
want to know which regions are  that the

660
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,569
stage is supporting Ok you command

661
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:08,660
Vision will be for you in all the

662
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,319
regions that it has support at the

663
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,300
moment

664
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,730
and it's interesting, oh,

665
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,880
when with you I decided a

666
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,480
week, right or obese, she also didn't open

667
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,320
the new datacenter that every week  but if it

668
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,290
was I'll hear about seen on the internet

669
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,130
calm they don't provide washing a new

670
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,820
region so update versions it will

671
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,740
download from today will update it will save

672
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,830
this to the local database and you will be

673
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,320
able to run the tests

674
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,940
of those nephews that are a region ahead there  wf

675
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,090
So this seven

676
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,350
Williams once in command that is related to the

677
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:02,530
region, he's interesting, did

678
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,780
you know exactly which region

679
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,650
your client is  You use

680
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,730
Itaú in Greece you already know that and you don't want to

681
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,500
explore all the regions that I'm going to

682
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,770
do to call in the west side, it's also

683
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,440
interesting you're in the regions

684
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,589
if you know for sure this will speed up a

685
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:26,599
lot of test test will be very fast

686
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,210
because it  you won't have to make several

687
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,400
barbecues seem easier for

688
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,400
all regions to be able to take the service or

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,339
see what resource to run So it

690
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:42,349
's at home if you want to make the test

691
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:46,549
faster it's certain regions and you'll

692
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:49,880
work or will run the  text and

693
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,069
then there's an interesting thing, which is

694
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,490


695
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,400
if you do Eco all the staff look there

696
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,320
in the beautiful case it's Kale, the acquisitions

697
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,410
he makes and having done it to see if he's

698
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:15,480
going to use Caio's origin, the rules, right

699
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,860
say they  they're for farting

700
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,369
But oh but there's no security service

701
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:28,920
there I keep you he can do it he

702
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,560
knows that when he knows when it works he

703
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,200
'll want a selfie and it's coming

704
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,080
from a callused face he tells you then you

705
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,180
say  So if your

706
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,280
client has the Throat configured, she

707
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,000
WS you are using an opaque hymn cable, you

708
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,710
will change this Hair to inject for

709
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,470
dinner

710
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:59,260
at 12 any straight line that is not from the

711
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,180
wedding.

712
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,030
on Zap you saw

713
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,480
this is very efficient it works get it

714
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,040
even from the beginning he was talking

715
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,450
there I was learning to test your

716
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,510
cell phone WS I used the cable to

717
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,359
do some things and quickly and it

718
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,340
turns resources Alert fired

719
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,470
place I must have to understand  what

720
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,830
it was, he also started the

721
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,840
transfer, is that he returned the package

722
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,260
he experience with the pf clerk test

723
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,800
was this one connected to this one and they

724
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,109
implemented this possibility of

725
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,020
changing the laugh, right, so I'll fix

726
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,670
some things here for him because of

727
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,839
writing

728
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,330
ó Carol is

729
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:52,130
and after seven Rios Assis 33 cooked

730
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,140
related to the regions of Greece that

731
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,490
I mentioned, there is a fact that the commands that the

732
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,390
command that executes the module, right then  it's

733
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,730
very easy to receive it as these

734
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,510
things you can see is Halo is Zac

735
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,390
in these strong ones it's wrong or Export right are

736
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,570
those cases taking asec so I

737
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,080
suppose the keys are configured

738
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,040
But there is already an active session I already accepted

739
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,160
the regions where you can get videos  and

740
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,810
I want to know what's good now

741
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:35,170
and then I need to go see the I want to recover

742
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,040
all instances of type S2

743
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,850
are already hectares here are

744
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,980
somehow bringing this account of the disease

745
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,760
that I'm doing the test is taking

746
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,540
followed by  lobito Voga so,

747
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,070
um, the interest in one, he's going to run

748
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,040
this mode that doesn't relate to

749
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,160
distance from RD, this case here,

750
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,590
but that's what I wanted me to be

751
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:18,200
two, so with a lot he's going to make

752
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,650
calls to collected WS  and servers

753
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,540
that are running on Amazon and

754
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,650
keep this in the focal SQL database

755
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,760
here ok

756
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,270
and the things here is the execution of pacu on

757
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,760
top of another way it paid if you

758
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,660
don't know what are several votes from  if

759
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,020
here they receive medical pay only

760
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,670
some receive there it

761
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,950
's sad you can pass with pabllo

762
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,890
this region you

763
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,140
specifically want is a little ambiguous it is

764
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,750
if you've accepted the alliance region you

765
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,000
need me to go anyway but he has

766
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,510
it you've liked  so to

767
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,480
know that this guy has to do this you want to

768
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,000
know why this guy has paid on his

769
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,210
face

770
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,210
and

771
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:20,080


772
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,740


773
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,790
here goes  how

774
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,869
do you receive them but in the case since I did it

775
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:36,849
and it receives buses the argument videos

776
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,490
which is optional if I want to go here

777
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,430
since today I will format regions where

778
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,160
water does not have a possible which is cowardly

779
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,130
service here I can do the numbering

780
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,789
of stocks  instances of the MDS only

781
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:56,289
a specific region so I think this

782
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:01,050
is to see I live to have this here I

783
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,520
already choose the region of the BIOS consepe

784
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,660
so it doesn't make sense because we'll

785
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,730
be just give it a go  to the party

786
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,839
sometimes it's not

787
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,770
hello hello

788
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:23,420
Oh so I think this has a

789
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,710
There are many things to say more

790
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,430
about command execution missing

791
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,619
Evan second from the box you want to execute

792
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:38,900
right then the votes sent Ixi or RS you

793
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,210
will have access to  these votes that even

794
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,240
if such certain modules, right followed,

795
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,049
go from this module and run I need

796
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:50,000
help in relation to the real module to

797
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,860
follow on mobile and go there

798
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,960
Call me here, look,

799
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,980
and the list of commands beer,

800
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:06,859
if it's great to drop it, it has the

801
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:08,330
commands  that are related to

802
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,970
WS Keys management, the first of

803
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,430
scissors and there was excess here, which is to

804
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,380
set the key that you will use in the

805
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,070
session.

806
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:25,490


807
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,140


808
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,220
party we've already seen the experience of these

809
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,910
appliques here I just wanted it to be interesting

810
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:41,390
because with it you can change

811
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,359
the account area key to pay some bill

812
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:50,210
to another in WS And then how does this leave

813
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,240
your horny test  the a little uglier you know,

814
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,150
but faster you don't need to

815
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,880
shut down, restart anyway, it's very

816
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,990
similar too, as a serial system, it's one of

817
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,760
those doors that you

818
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,960
kiss this one I can do to the

819
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,190
stadium of sessions with Sergio command and

820
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,630
if I want for example  I have two

821
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,110
fractions here there is the exist see if you want to

822
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,170
change to the session he loved irritating

823
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,930
ask him if now Suape

824
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,850
what

825
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,940
hi and then i can go to this section

826
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,109
here

827
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:42,540
o class 1

828
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,330
and he told me ww keep switching between

829
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:51,650
several accounts  to ships

830
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,250
Hi and so oh my quick test for

831
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,310
AIDS with growing going it's

832
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,380
only one so it will be for me What

833
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,730
are the tensions your time just of the

834
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,640
moment so I chose this action and series

835
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,210
A

836
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,020
I have amount of cassation can

837
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,460
You're going to give that complicated matter

838
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,580
already the effect there again at the end you

839
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,619
've even done the hip-hop Jackson of the clients

840
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:25,070
these and everyone is fan of her profession

841
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,680
with this key of yours together this

842
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,290
key your computer  Or there is a good

843
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,890
Park practice on Saturday that the computer is

844
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,080
exposed and someone has access to this

845
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,900
Keys So you will have access to various

846
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,570
things your customers are going to be

847
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:47,119
cool is good at the end of this test then there

848
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,640
were fan pot exceptions if you have the  on

849
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,680
stage Never let me don't let there is this

850
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,330
other command here which is the import

851
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:06,230
I wanted what I was talking about is 15 is I don't use

852
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,359
it but you don't have to use it when you

853
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,220
install the utility

854
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,930
Hi Linda from WS and setup it it

855
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,599
creates this  this credentials file

856
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:22,560
Aquino inside the directory of the tip of the

857
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,730
briosa user's home

858
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,640
Hi and there inside these gifts You can

859
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,710
have several profiles

860
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,830
the support you have 10 clients so

861
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,920
you can control keys in this file

862
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,700
that you are using the WS just by indicating

863
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,200
the name of the  profile you want to use

864
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,619
so if I had it here on my

865
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:49,630
computer somewhere Initial in this

866
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,080
file I can simply import

867
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,619
the keys Pass this three

868
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:01,310
strong

869
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:09,180
heat and the door followed by the men from  third parties

870
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,859
And then it will import the key for me and then

871
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:18,569
you see if it will somehow take it

872
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,369
to you already used it told me that sometimes

873
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,040
another one appeared I have this

874
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,530
file more than I

875
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,660
and I removed it here on the computer It

876
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,670
needs security and I prefer  use but you

877
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,170
have the possibility of importing the

878
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,010
key if you use this you can cut

879
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,680
everything by writing do it with the parameters

880
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,770
[Music]

881
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,800
Cassol it will importer left that

882
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,530
had your children all profiles I

883
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,410
was present in this file here and there

884
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:55,360
is the opposite  right, I'm going to matter,

885
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:01,370
EcoSport is going to export the key that you

886
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:05,600
have this current function to the

887
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,100
accredited file, then

888
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,990
call me, I did it here, it's worth whatever

889
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,000
sport you want he'll say that

890
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,990
it's going to export the key that are here

891
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,120
to used by  violence to the

892
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,590
file I want to see if I don't think it's

893
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,750
handling this situation all the way

894
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:29,140
here and open a new screen that's

895
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,549
here, look,

896
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,820
your new resource for me

897
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:43,380
and inside and there it has a profile 1500 u  m month

898
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,560
with the key I sat they told me in

899
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,310
the recording

900
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,850
if you use this type for dentists

901
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,370
to mind if you want

902
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,790
to be unbearable to enjoy somehow I decided

903
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,260
to please I used it little and if you have

904
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,770
strong on the outside and

905
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,880
you just need it already said  from him you José

906
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,410
Self explanatory if you can delete you

907
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,100
it's you and I recommend that you do

908
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,490
this whenever you finish your test and then

909
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,580
this one came and what is going out you don't want

910
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,340
anymore I left it there time to have a beer I'll

911
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,060
close the package.

912
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,100
grow fast but then I have this

913
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,950
other command here that I'll hope to be

914
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,790
also that it's important to be able to it here

915
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,040
which is oh vs so

916
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,280
if you're not in the moods that this

917
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,980
guy does he runs

918
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,700
commands from the WS command line utility

919
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,170
then

920
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,579
and  I screwed up the votes here at Parkour and I

921
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,240
didn't find a service that I want I do

922
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,510
n't have to go but I don't know there's no

923
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,480
crocheting operation tricot benefits that

924
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,900
really don't do it yet and I want it here

925
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,609
inside the thing.  action

926
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:27,240
I want to list the club's pitches

927
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,359
we need the bios and without leaving

928
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:35,130
here so this ABS is exactly

929
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,480
that I can execute WS commands

930
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,299
in here without the need for a lawyer

931
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:45,150
and the other end and it is calculated

932
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:49,319
saying I thought I put it  he's a

933
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:50,510
bully

934
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,910
and he could handle it, he couldn't make the

935
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,160
initials. But I want you to know that

936
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,260
you can see that this train is on because at

937
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:03,350
some point, if you don't have any,

938
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,680
I'll charge you specifically for the services or

939
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,300
natural resources that you're only wanting to

940
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,260
explore.  you can run the command

941
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,120
from the WS cell phone, right, so it's up to

942
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,790
each child to understand this here and I

943
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,970
highly recommend learning these you

944
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,330
don't know Instagram if he

945
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,840
even recommended you to talk using the

946
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,290
stage, sir, go there and

947
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,800
do your basic problem, because  is a lot

948
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,980
of what the pope uses is that he also in this

949
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,290
case so it's interesting to know

950
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,630
these two tools to open this

951
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:51,940
is Nico you like console/ont  on console

952
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,750
that is

953
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:00,180
and it HBS has apehist what is glasses

954
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,990
Roda Brasil to better serve uses

955
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,700
more water I'm opening this mess through

956
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,080
for those who don't know either ah ah ah but

957
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,080
there's a console there in the Browser you

958
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,080
can operate your infrastructure Via

959
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,590
Brazil here resource delete resource

960
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,750
scalar resource in Kendall pencil it will

961
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:32,250
then this room with floor it will create

962
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:37,760
a URL that is for

963
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,920
the user to log in from this console 300

964
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,320
differentials you have here in the function

965
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,880
Tá viva et al The design guys before you

966
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,470
want  explore there I rarely use it

967
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,210
here I only used it once or twice this

968
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,990
command will not be useful for me

969
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:07,250
because it is if the broth train there in the garment

970
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,600
must be configured,

971
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,170
this trait will be there, it will be marked there at the

972
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,700
end of the way  that someone the fat one with the

973
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,610
soil is calling to see what you do

974
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,830
here with the bow I think it's very salty

975
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:25,900
there on Paulo Freire's console maybe it

976
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,760
's necessary I don't use it I used it twice

977
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,330
and

978
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,910
I don't see you know what vo  you're also

979
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:40,630
among the ones so that's just hope

980
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,270
you've specialized here I hope you

981
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,440
enjoyed it I hope you use a pacu and

982
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,500
send your contributions It's a project

983
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,150
that I believe will get very

984
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,810
big I think it will soon become one

985
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,110
and with support  several other resources and

986
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,900
services from Greece I'm investing my

987
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,320
time dedicated to open-source projects

988
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,520
in this project for this project

What's it like I have music and this

990
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:16,040
let's come client who uses this and it's

991
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,450
important to me that it's a tool

992
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,740
that at  times want to save as

993
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,740
I think that's it thank you so much for the

994
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,810
hug and what's up

995
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,870
