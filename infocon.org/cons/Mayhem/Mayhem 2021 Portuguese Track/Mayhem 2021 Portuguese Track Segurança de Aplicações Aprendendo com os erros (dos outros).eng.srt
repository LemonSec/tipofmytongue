Hello, welcome to the

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,759
application security lecture learning from the mistakes

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,760
of others my name is Rafael brinhosa there

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,760
passing by today thanks for

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,369
everyone's presence I also thank you for

6

00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,919
Santos EA all staff And during in

8
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:25,359
Village by  invitation and for the reason he

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,140
accepts this lecture

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm talking a little about myself so

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,560
the doctoral student in Computer Science

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,420
at UFSC has some experience and

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,730
with information security I was

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,810
passionate about the area, right. Always

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,350
working there for a long time already

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,320
Grandson year in the area has some

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,430
certifications in the area I started very early

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,670
there at the time sleeping here 96 there

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,190
I started to program Ademir scripts that and

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,380
the idea and the joke there was to knock

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,020
down friends to do what some older

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,060
ones understand doing fludd is  and

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,520
become Pedro's channel in this I'm from that

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,950
time, so I started programming the

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,640
script for me to do it later on

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
programming in Delphi

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,960
and then 98 start  i in this part of

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,420
programming

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,290
And then you and I started specializing at that

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,770
time I already dreamed and shouldn't like

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,720
from here Hatch, right, I started dreaming about

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,070
understanding better about security and

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,560
learning, right and without legendary

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,810
Good morning first company the first

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,810
company had the site  hacked right there was

36
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,090
more than once only in Charqueada once

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,259
this one starts with a default password then

38
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,970
I had

39
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,880
What is the other site there without

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,160
input validation and invaded in the same way

41
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,070
I was also learning today with the

42
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,940
mistakes and successes, right and now It's  It has to be

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,350
a little smarter to

44
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,330
learn from the mistakes of others too, right Not only

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,600
me making my own mistakes in

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,280
this career there after having my

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,680
first company I did some internships and

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,920
ended up working on the idea if it should

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,900
be an American company of 180 thousand

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,160
employees that was bought by HP

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,300
Ah and because I understand security,

52
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,340
I started testing the applications

53
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,250
then DS were General Motors applications

54
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,080
at nbs developed a surg system  and

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,800
General Motors and I ended up finding

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,020
vulnerabilities in the DS systems and

57
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,300
in this context, he was invited to

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,190
be part of Globo, following Fashion

59
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,890
on-board DDS

60
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,600


61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,810


62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,020


63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,130
.  Training I started my master's degree

64
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,450
comparison more security right and I ended up

65
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,900
joining Dell in should be part of

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,940
the Security team consult but also

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,250
be part of Jardim América is

68
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,430
a hacker team from Dell and was in

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,760
Malaysia I had a meeting at 2:30 at 2:  30

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,380
in the morning to have a meeting with the

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,530
staff to exchange ideas and learn,

72
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,430
right, Adel, it was interesting

73
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,860
that back in 2009 2008 they already had the

74
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,910
idea of taking it by themselves, right? It's a selfie from the radio,

75
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,830
right, so Dell went  I

76
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,840
learned a lot from her during that time, right

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,260
then for seven years working in the Grid Valley there,

78
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,799
it's part of the sbem

79
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,980
and I became a professor at the

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,819
Federal Institute of Santa Catarina, right,

81
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,489
summer is where  and I'm currently with a

82
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,740
teacher, Dr. Catarinense

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,950
Hi and then I was learning more and more

84
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,900
about safety and desire, there is always

85
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,070
exchanging information that people are

86
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,760
learning teaching, right then

87
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
we always have something to learn and also

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,130
to teach

89
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,209
and not why  Why do we

90
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,150
need to think about application security,

91
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,950
right, because learning from the mistakes of

92
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,460
others in this area, right? It's good to know

93
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,760
that

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,410


95
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,970


96
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,560
insecurity, right?  the door will be open and

97
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,030
you need to have a port 80 open

98
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,870
love, port 443 open, right, like

99
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,770
you, Faro won't protect you from an attack,

100
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,100
an application is a malicious entrance

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
there, except in certain cases, right, but

102
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,680
then we need  to worry about

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,390
a software, you need to worry about

104
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,820
the application's security and not only the

105
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,950
security of buying Faro buy

106
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,560
antivirus buy right Yeah

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
and that kind of thing we always have to

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
to worry about security, right And

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,500
this sculpture of ours has increased every

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,990
year, right now we have to

111
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,450
worry about the security of the cloud,

112
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,770
we have to worry about it's a series

113
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,320
of things, third parties sometimes

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,280
have our data, right?  Here's some

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,040
data, it's not an average time of 191 days

116
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,660
for a company to detect it was

117
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,450
invaded and another 66 days to contain an

118
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,770
invasion in prison, average loss of...

119
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,810
62 Million Dollars from

120
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,760
invasions, right then and according to the

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,520
ponemon institute in a 2017 survey,

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,450
we see that companies

123
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,419
are not even invaded and they go a long time

124
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,340
without detecting an invasion, and it

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,360
takes longer to contain

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,090
invasion so we see that this data

127
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,770
proves and corroborates this

128
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,870
issue

129
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,240
Hi, and the impact on the pocket, right? So

130
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,270
companies started to worry more

131
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,190
about safety, because when the impact on the

132
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,100
pocket, right?

133
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,260


134
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,180
sa

135
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,510
publication of a touch, right, lose 9 days,

136
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,760
come 2019 to 2.7 days in 2020

137
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,040
and we came up with a proof of

138
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,610
concept, people are doing explode there is already a

139
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,450
module for the goal explode in People are

140
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,900
already running, right, searching the

141
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,820
entire internet, trying  then

142
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,350
attack the discovery of vulnerabilities, right? You

143
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,020
want to see when I have these

144
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,520
debates, right guys, it goes around it

145
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,660
explodes because in everything who is this site there to

146
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,370
try to get a little money and with

147
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,169
a bucket blog

148
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,629


149
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,999
people commented today there

150
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,620
is clix, not a very famous case, it

151
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,889
would be like the American Serasa, right, the

152
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,460
company with credit, it's the wife of

153
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
the data of 143 million people

154
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,419
because they didn't update the software, here's

155
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,490
a sentence we know that the criminals

156
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,490
were a vulnerability  on our website

157
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,039
for the United States the extract part

158
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,839
if you come 2017 5638 of always Flex a statement a

159
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,950


160
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,020
and if you go there see this you see

161
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,460
here already has sport for it right j

162
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,130
I've been exploring this

163
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,300
vulnerability there for a

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,780
long time right now, right? It's a question on my

165
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,150
part, strangers, it's almost a Swiss cheese,

166
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,670
from time to time

167
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,120
, Rc vulnerability appears and dead snow as

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,420
execution and the name is grave

169
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,360
Exploring a lot, so whoever has the

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,890
back is also very careful

171
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,389
and here the Sport is here so a

172
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,599
proof of concept, you can come here in this

173
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,070
sport here which is he wasn't

174
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,179
checking that it was the

175
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,979
operating system if it was Windows it

176
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,769
ran 1  cm if it were beautiful that you

177
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:46,070
use the best, you would send the command

178
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,889
there to this server, so the

179
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:53,810
risk is all that here on Via URL, right. I

180
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,260
doing a refresh doesn't actually make a

181
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,920
clipping of the post namorad9 URL type, right, but I

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,740
ran it then  a post type clipping is

183
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,930
you can send there the command you want to

184
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,430
run So in this case here I want to

185
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,699
know which user is running

186
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,579
this webserver, right if he says it's a

187
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,760
Roth so man if Dilma is worse  practice

188
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,260
still running web server as root

189
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,990
potato take from the Server, right If it's

190
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,990
a part II

191
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,640
and then they started to explore and the server

192
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,830
to do an escalation

193
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,190
privilege escalation there and have the server do

194
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,339
that attack

195
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,660
the version then right then it's a  drawing that the

196
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,189
example of the attack is not a very

197
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:46,329
simple thing before for normal air was left

198
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:47,980
to update a package from the

199
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,610
back is

200
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,790
and suddenly A proof of

201
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,029
concept appeared exploiting this

202
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,920
vulnerability suddenly in the whole world right the companies

203
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,320
that I being  attacked, it's for

204
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
this vulnerability that you don't have the

205
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,540
risk, right It might be that yesterday, right, to

206
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,399
put an example, right,

207
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,590
yesterday, the guy put the server to run.

208
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,770


209
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,290


210
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,690
a company

211
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,520
that has so much exposure, right like arqflex,

212
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,080
you don't have a good Paty policy

213
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,480
less pest management, right?

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,240


215
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,639
Enough, right,

216
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,550
to get me out of this type of attack, you're

217
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,860
going to have this exploitation, the

218
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,730
last example

219
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,070
of 42 here. Recalling a little about the

220
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,529
concept of window of vulnerability, right,

221
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,870
we have there

222
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,050
and the level of risk, right.

223
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,620
vulnerability as I won't

224
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,390
remember discovery, right, it has a

225
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,320
very high risk here, right, it's made

226
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,200
public, it increases the risk, it's the truth

227
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,400
known to the supplier, right, too risky

228
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,960
Neo sell the supplier warns its

229
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,430
customers that there is their first

230
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,860
skill, right

231
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,519
and then  DDS tools develop

232
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,380
signatures to try to protect, right,

233
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,649
make a virtual one very close, right, MDS,

234
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,940
an Afe will try to protect.

235
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,829


236
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:41,240


237
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240


238
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,339
so here the

239
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,649
Skill level goes down and

240
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,230
all the affected systems are installed nearby, the

241
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,029
risk found, right problem that is never

242
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,440
applied, we all have been affected, right a lot of

243
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,080
people  1 left the system there, forgot and

244
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,209
this will know when you have one that were

245
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,060
invaded, right. And that's also a problem,

246
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,370
that's why the risk doesn't go to zero, right? No

247
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,130
risk will always exist, we'll have

248
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,910
a legacy, right. The legacy of

249
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,310
unmitigated vulnerabilities, right  and

250
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,620
Zé where people attack, right, he works in a

251
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,820
company and they had many sites, very

252
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,930
systems, right Cris and one of those

253
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,620
sites was there in Japan hosted quietly, it

254
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,930
's forgotten, and the company just went and remember

255
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,700
him when he suffered one of that,

256
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,740
right  site was insured to appear

257
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,250
lacquered Portal time

258
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,910
hi and then run after the loss, right.

259
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,830
Had there been any sensitive type of

260
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,140
information on this site,

261
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,330
hacked, right, because it was hacked, it

262
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,900
was a loan, it was exploited, right?

263
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,780
the

264
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,280
window of vulnerability, right, we

265
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,950
always have to try, too, be aware of

266
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,020
it, making these updates,

267
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,350
whenever possible, it is due to problems that

268
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,630
update too early

269
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,530
and sometimes the  we do apply a pet that does

270
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,300
n't break the bank, right, we've seen Pets

271
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,030
that were applied there who's the

272
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,870
first one and I saw her Blue had a lot of

273
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,870
problems, right but also taking a long time to

274
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,390
make the pet can also cause problems

275
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,550
because it's there  it's invaded

276
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,470
well so that's why but sometimes a

277
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,360
defense in depth can help to

278
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,660
a certain extent at a time a system

279
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,839
that had if the peripherals had

280
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,060
a light application Firewall in front

281
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,089
well configured is once I had

282
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,660
caught more danger That that attack

283
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,019
it wouldn't have been explored right but there are

284
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,160
assumptions

285
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,710
ok so here a little

286
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,899
closer, right Whole window today I'm going to

287
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:04,839
shave that I've already explained one since

288
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,080
the discovery of the skill.

289
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,720


290
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,300
customers the

291
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,570
tools and protection are updated the

292
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,930
published pet will get to know you close

293
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,940
installed all the themes have all

294
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,550
this time here, it can happen the

295
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,560
exploration and then still  still here

296
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,260
did not apply Pet right still vulnerable

297
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,489
and the result is not look for Flex

298
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,829
loss so far of 2.8 billion

299
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,980
reais also imagine loss loss

300
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,309
has company image loss the

301
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,509
president of the company who was you

302
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,189
was president of the company for twenty years

303
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,579
he  he had to resign he resigned is, look at

304
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,559
the amount of loss due to the

305
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,230
failure of an oil from the application that was

306
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,239
using a library and it became

307
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,739
unsafe, right, it was discovered there, in

308
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:02,760
fact, probiotec participants

309
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,420
and it's not the shares, right, we see a

310
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,910
drop here and 141  dollars that's 92 dollars, right

311
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,450
So that 65 percent in shares is

312
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,450
the prefix so the problem

313
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,930
is So look at the loss for

314
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,510
investors and personal detail there

315
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,330
were still directors who sold the shares

316
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,660
before the leak had

317
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,730
become  The public of the mining companies

318
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,990
ended up being arrested and then it got

319
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,570
ugly, right

320
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,270
and how could it have been avoided, right?

321
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,310
ts

322
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,000
right Update also has a list and

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
that you use which systems you use here

324
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,030
libraries which systems use right to

325
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,860
make this update right

326
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,770
whenever possible use Web application Faro

327
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,310
right then and always be very careful with

328
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,900
safe libraries It's mainly

329
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,030
those that already  there's even a way, right, people

330
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,530
today know that the student part has

331
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,580
already had some

332
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,680
problems, right, a lot of care with

333
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,060
him, right?

334
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,800


335
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,590


336
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,600
critical assets the ones with the

337
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
highest risk are the ones with the highest risk data, you

338
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,500
know the technologies that these

339
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,880
assets use, and did then

340
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,490
update the management of pets, update them,

341
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,380
right and defense in depth with the

342
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,579
publication they will do is

343
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,069
the beloved of security that  are possible

344
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,449
to apply

345
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,299
and now we go to the next case Mary

346
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:50,379
Wood redeems from three, right,

347
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,179
leaked results of five.  Two million

348
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,339
customers then including

349
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,529
contact details of people whose name

350
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,029
address matches between this

351
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,429
email and phone

352
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,429
identity account information eg

353
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,380
account number and points balance but no passwords

354
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,449
né additional personal details

355
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,179
eg company sex  and day and month of

356
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,089
anniversary partnerships settings for

357
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,919
example programs and

358
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,709
airline loyalty number in Claras and

359
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,909
transfers Because it's

360
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,099
stay preference room language preference right

361
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,480
I have a lot of sensitive data stored here is

362
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,029
a How it happened, right there was a

363
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,620
compromised password  two

364
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,940
employees of franchised hotels operated

365
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,830
on Marriott brands,

366
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,690
right And who used the application then to

367
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,070
provide service to hotel guests,

368
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,519
right then see how a

369
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,460
commitment

370
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,409
of what can be pain might not stay in,

371
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,409
for example, we had a

372
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:52,010
exposure of 5.3 million data can

373
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,020
the risk, right result, is there an average? I

374
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,950
am recently  18.4 was set up for

375
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,980
some pounds million pounds, right by

376
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,500
gdpr so here comes the issue of

377
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,429
compliance, and here comes the fine, right

378
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,549
now it's liable to fine, so both

379
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:16,070
out there with us PR other laws we

380
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,430
privacy Account that  with lgpd

381
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,890
and now we don't think about security anymore

382
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,500
just because the company really wants to

383
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,880
remain safe, there is a need

384
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,100
but also thinking about the pocket issue,

385
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,470
right

386
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,880
Oi and the fall in shares from 143 dollars

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,159
to $59 need the fall here Search for

388
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,400
company actions, right After

389
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,060
this data leak

390
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,570
and how could it have been avoided, right,

391
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,280
identification of anomalies, right, how can

392
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,350
you account for two employees, right, it

393
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,860
can leak 5.3 million records.

394
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,770


395
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,180
they

396
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,940
were exploited for this, you see

397
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,910
that there is a large volume of data being

398
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,370
extracted, so identifying anomalies

399
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,890
is user behavior, right with the face

400
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,370
that is here in my franchise?  it's in the

401
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,250
hotel here in Brazil what is an

402
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,830
example, right? Why is it going to send

403
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,310
customer data to our network in Europe,

404
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,920
for example?

405
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,680


406
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,910


407
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,340
this

408
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,780
time I had a two-factor authentication,

409
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,820
right, the password would not have been stolen,

410
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,770
I would have been able to do all of

411
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,130
this, right And if there is a second factor, then I was

412
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,710
able to access the system, so if you

413
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,240
think it was an authentication failure,

414
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,750
right, It could have been  two factors, right

415
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,770
then, and help identify the avoidance of

416
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,080
the film this afternoon, I talked about

417
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,770
authorization, right, because if this user

418
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,930
had authorization to access millions

419
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,900
of clients worldwide, right, it was

420
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,090
a detection failure, right in the sense that it

421
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,530
could justify the

422
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,200
anonymous user behavior  the amount of data is going to change the

423
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,660
amount of data, right

424
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,720
again, a greater security even for

425
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,220
sapeins, right for the system as a whole

426
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,679
and not using a myth in Brazil, it's not  what

427
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,330
each employee really needs to

428
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,820
access is they need to access this entire record

429
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,330
, right, something that sometimes

430
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,520
are business issues of business logic,

431
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,870
they are not thought of with

432
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,340
regard to security

433
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
and now we are going to take a third

434
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,270
Capital AM case in the very scandalous case  and it's

435
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,670
very different also to put it taking, right, you

436
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,130
had exposed the data posts of 100

437
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,950
million people because you didn't

438
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,000
correctly configure the access permissions in the

439
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,430
cloud, that's where the question comes in, which is

440
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,030
the issue of data. Use of the cloud is a bad

441
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,570
use of the cloud, right  we have to remember

442
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:14,220
and the cloud provider is responsible for

443
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,420
cloud security, right and the user is

444
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,820
responsible for cloud security,

445
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,440
so we use the name Aécio Neves

446
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,550
infrastructure success if you need to think about

447
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,830
how to maintain security in the cloud, right How

448
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,200
Our data  stay Safe in the cloud And there

449
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,840
's a problem that happened

450
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,240
ok both example of attack you used one for

451
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,049
a server Side Quest Ford a rich daycare

452
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,760
so pro IP 16925  4,925 four, which is the

453
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
IP of the internal Amazon instance, right And it

454
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,179
was made by making the requests

455
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,029
within the internal network because because

456
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,070
through the Side Quest server for it

457
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,110
you have a problem with the site and it allows you to

458
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,440
take a screenshot of pages from other

459
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,890
sites, right?  this public service

460
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,470
if I don't protect that and weight this site

461
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,200
goes to painho then make a screenshot

462
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
it can for example you the

463
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,390
internal company of the network, right and even the

464
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,919
private IP on the Amazon Instance right so

465
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,920
here is what happened here

466
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,310
well then I  there was a page that

467
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,500
was making internal requests, right,

468
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,780
so I didn't have this protection here and I was

469
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,140
able to access the instance IP

470
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,600
and the soul private

471
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,850


472
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,520


473
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,510
easier And these

474
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,340
And they had this milk

475
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,180
banquet and synchronization permission it's

476
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,310
easier is for me to leave each resource here or

477
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,660
leave an asterisk that I can use

478
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,900
any resource  rso it's easier to let one

479
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,150
be this here that the user can

480
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,550
access any feature of this

481
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,550
story gs3 here at amazon It

482
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,220
's a storage message for hands can

483
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,720
access any resource is much

484
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,770
easier, right This policy here in security

485
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,140
but what's more  I'm sure I'm here to

486
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,660
make a batch list here which resources he

487
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,490
can access,

488
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,390
right, I'll leave it all, it's much

489
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,510
safer for me to establish Which

490
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,440
resources he has access, right, but it

491
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,320
wasn't badly configured, right user If I

492
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,070
found it on the bus, right, he went  there and

493
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,530
dark, this vulnerability and managed

494
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,600
internships, sometimes more than 100 million

495
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,610
human capital customers, generating a

496
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,000
huge loss, right then the PSB started

497
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,700
the investigation, right and got

498
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,150

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,179
all the information that this betray, right that

513
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,580
infoblox if uncle seems interesting he

514
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,610
has more than 500 Kansas container

515
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,429
docker while talking to his friend

516
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,840
here right I'm not going to prison because I

517
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,520
'm very anonymous here I used it will

518
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,809
then lose the directory  and that's it, but it was

519
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:01,789
silly, there isn't a perfect crime, right,

520
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:06,590
that story so at the same time he

521
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,110
went there to us,

522
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,470


523
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,820


524
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,429
right?  so I thought

525
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:22,670
it was after that I practically put on

526
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:27,320
a bomb vest right, I

527
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,430
'm not doing Colinas in

528
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,760
human capital formation and admitting that I want to

529
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,300
distribute these banquets on these data

530
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,430
first et  There are social Security

531
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,010
Numbers with full names and date of

532
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,080
birth in the last ones and we continue it

533
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,210
would be how the CPF works in the United

534
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,070
States but a little more

535
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,590
restricted data, but still confidential.

536
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,600


537
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,120


538
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,440
they already ask for a little

539
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,270
more information, there have already been a lot of

540
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,730
leaks, so the

541
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,590
security policy of the banks, but the number is

542
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,510
still very very sensitive, given very

543
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,570
sensitive and with date with full name and

544
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,910
date of birth, right on the site that has it

545
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,560
here asks for a date  of birth

546
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,340
full name Such for CPF right to recover

547
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,370
password right So there comes a risk then

548
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,680
I go there result right the hacker right she

549
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,530
got five years in prison or if you

550
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,350
guys I have $1000 fine is the company

551
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,890
had a 400 million reais of  damage to

552
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,440
the eyes, the size of the damage, right?

553
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,230
Because of this joke,

554
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,919
a very big loss for the company, ok,

555
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:45,109
I could have been avoided,

556
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,679
the perms are correct.  S3 access issions

557
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,489
use Minimum privilege right and then use the

558
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,200
list of resources that a

559
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,279
restricted resource policy right know what

560
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,769
resources each user can access what

561
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,450
injections or internal servers is

562
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,789
protecting it against the server Side Quest

563
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,029
for Harry right then I  I did this have

564
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,919
some techniques Neto Validates

565
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,899
the entries to avoid your site with

566
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,210
the Forge plus a blocking of an

567
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,049
internal weight list or better still does a

568
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,090
white list of what can be accessed

569
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,609
This is where the requests that involve

570
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,600
the server side  ok,

571
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,910
i just say i could have avoided all this

572
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,010
headache avoided as well. And then

573
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,039
sometimes buy a test, you could use

574
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,530
some tools there from skandi S3 and

575
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,660
such and also find it's just not a

576
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,410
skill, right before it was hacked,

577
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,120
right, maliciously and  With the data

578
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,479
exposed,

579
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,070
I'm talking here then about the general law of

580
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,139
protection of personal data, right, since

581
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:56,999
we're in Portuguese Trek, right,

582
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,679
we're talking here in

583
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,710
Portuguese  a little bit about our law

584
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,230
in Brazil, right then, the general

585
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,639
data protection law says that in the

586
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,990
seventh chapter here, security and good

587
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,909
practices are the first 46 is the

588
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:17,070
security and confidentiality of data

589
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,230
processing agents must adopt

590
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,720
security measures  technical and

591
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,909
administrative afflicts to protect

592
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,169
personal data from unauthorized access

593
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:27,840
and from accidental or

594
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,169
unlawful situations of destruction loss alteration

595
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,179
communication any form of

596
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:37,529
inappropriate or unlawful processing is then the

597
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,119
processing agents must adopt

598
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,340
technical-administrative security measures

599
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,960
Africa or protect the data  personal, right

600
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,230
So, companies need to take

601
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,110
these measures, right, to avoid

602
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,070
unauthorized access, right

603
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,500
in accidental or unlawful situations of

604
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,450
destruction, loss, change, communication,

605
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,580
improper treatment, they are well explained here,

606
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,889
right. This Standard that we

607
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,899
are also responsible for protecting

608
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,120
information  is the company is the organization

609
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,590
it is responsible for a p

610
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,360
information protection

611
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,330
and me how to learn how to protect yourself is such a

612
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,809
great source of information there.

613
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,260
Today it's ASP so open web application

614
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,830
Security

615
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,380


616
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,380


617
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,860
Project  in the protection to

618
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,960
understand how to do

619
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,230
software security,

620
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,049
there is no application security and there is, for example, Astro pop

621
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:41,460
has one and 2017 here should also be

622
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,090
updated soon, but the

623
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,740
first ten of the most critical

624
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,960
web applications with this  here is the list

625
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,370
and we can't have

626
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,190
any rights, there are other numbers given,

627
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,980
but these are the top ones and we

628
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,320
also have to pay close attention.

629
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,929


630
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,559


631
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,750
broken authentication is exposure run

632
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,850
sensitive XML external and this right West

633
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,000
xz right another one of those broken

634
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,940
security errors cross-site scripting

635
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,799
secure sterilization using a

636
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,690
compo  nent with one of the acquaintances and

637
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,820
that we talk about, for example, here we

638
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,059
can say that here is the case with wix,

639
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,610
right, we bet instruments,

640
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,240


641
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,400
we can talk a little about America

642
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,050
here

643
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,300
security error ends up

644
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,110
coming in here a little, the issue of

645
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,610
human capital would be the issue of

646
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,250
configurations and all that

647
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,250
and presto, Astro pop teen is a list

648
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,740
here, it's not everything in organization, you need to

649
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,190
know, here's a tip for

650
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,070
us to do  a quick snack sometimes

651
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,010
I want to do a quick test, right using the

652
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,590
different attack vectors the

653
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,070
polyglot XS can help with that, so what

654
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,900
does it do to test the scripting process,

655
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,060
right?

656
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,730


657
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,520
there is one it is a concatenation

658
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,850
of several writings that break

659
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,700
different contexts the not interesting

660
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,880
for a quick test it is an application I

661
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,210
'll do a demonstration here so it

662
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,410
's worth  m we can do it

663
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,650
is a quick test here, right

664
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,780
and the 17 polyglot Only if you can

665
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,680
see it here on my screen

666
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,840
and if you can see it here on the screen

667
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,300
do the demonstration here

668
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,130
putting it like

669
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,020
this is this that the page had not

670
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,000
chosen, oh yeah  also not put in

671
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,670
the Live references so I can

672
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,250
take it and explore it here, look, you have a

673
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,570
personal page so you know that

674
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,150
the blinking kingdom page was

675
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,650
the air page watchfire is a

676
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,690
fake bank the fake bank of course  that was a

677
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,700
test page So it has one, it's full of

678
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,620
vulnerabilities, right so you can

679
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,210
play here, right, sometimes to learn.

680
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,700


681
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,330


682
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,900


683
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,340
to give a goal here I could

684
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,250
Jack a pap right it means it was

685
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,860
executed my are young people click here

686
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,090
right and here it's a written process so

687
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,830
an example exploration of crust script

688
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,740
right using so make polyglot it

689
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,140
's very  it's interesting, right then, as I said

690
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,640
that there were several contexts, it's inside

691
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,780
the PT ml there's inside a specific tag

692
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,150
, we can see

693
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,179
where it was placed, right

694
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,360
here, look, the results come in, it

695
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,780
was inside this tag here  It is

696
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,330
sometimes we have other contexts, right, and

697
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,190
then using polyglot success can

698
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,130
help to identify them.

699
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,530


700
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,010


701
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,340


702
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,230
identify

703
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,390
vulnerabilities in a quick tip,

704
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,049
right practical.

705
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,149
And now coming back here on the way, talking

706
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:57,619
a little about how it can also help

707
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,360
protect yourself through automation, right, I did

708
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,519
a little project, right,

709
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,739
right?

710
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:11,089
try to update it's the testing site,

711
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:13,790
right, so I do what I run a

712
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,159
series of call tools using the

713
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,199
docker right eee automatism a series of

714
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,418
tests ok so I'll give an example here

715
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,440
for you to take a look here

716
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,219
I'm coming back here in just this one tests

717
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,679
here that it does it ok I didn't pay

718
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,980
much attention to the somewhat buggy code there

719
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,199
but the intention is good ok it's

720
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,599
good so here what did the site here

721
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,500
tested, right  You can look here well he

722
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,000
has it so call me do some w Betty right

723
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,290
he he has there a series of of he

724
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,910
does the down site da then they

725
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,270
Chrome headless browser Below

726
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,770
the Cetam site anticipate it down

727
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,359
certificates on it make a  download the

728
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,329
pages he does the Beauty with w3tech

729
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,670
trying to identify

730
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,099
low onerability I turn I'm you give me a bad check he

731
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,609
to try to identify the furniture

732
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:26,089
he checks the certificate he tries to

733
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,280
download Page he makes see if there is

734
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,780
information in the fish about that

735
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,610
domain

736
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,230
and he has it  identify social networks it

737
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,060
runs ASP Zap there it can a

738
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,520
certificate analysis this series used this

739
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,790
analysis runs the enemy and trying to downloaded the

740
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,910
banners identified in Brazil

741
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,050
render us are Secret Hai  r he runs a

742
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,810
sqlmap doing Klein on the headphones and they run

743
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,660
a sqlmap on everyone for automatically

744
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,250
that's what he found he he does a

745
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,010
directory subsite with Sublime 3

746
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,260
does a sub witch inside depending on

747
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,670
finding hidden details he runs oh

748
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,700
Monique you give the title  found

749
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
reality of the server and and in the versions

750
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,520
used of the web server it

751
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,730
surfs also trying to find

752
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,610
territories the Gol Booster also

753
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,770
so and then it runs the south of the me and that's

754
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,589


755
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:34,249
good so a domain you were here

756
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:38,059
sunday basically will find

757
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:39,769
trying  find the

758
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,469
application actually delivering it to you, it's all in

759
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,479
it so you can later do a

760
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,969
more comprehensive test, right, the idea

761
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:50,960
is automation, there is code for you to

762
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,430
improve, but you can already take advantage of

763
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,469
something, ok guys, you run a

764
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:57,579
series of docker container  here and

765
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:59,779
tools that are already containerized

766
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:03,410
São José to try to do the

767
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,269
security tests in a more automated way

768
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:07,309
for this big res  results with a

769
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,410
folder that it creates a folder throw the

770
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,569
results to that folder so here

771
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,910
an exercise there that can help there in

772
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,390
reggae o Mouse there to find some

773
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,269
durability a site in the publication

774
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:22,819
find the subdomains other

775
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,329
hidden folders hidden directories is a help

776
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,200
here,

777
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
that's cool.

778
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,220
And then one coming

779
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,450
back to our presentation, right, automation

780
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,790
can help with this question,

781
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,180


782
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,349


783
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,119


784
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,970
right?  ok broken authentication

785
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,560
object level authorization break

786
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,390
there from excessive data exposure not

787
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,760
so much happens right lack of

788
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,680
resources access rate limit here

789
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,520
because of the best futile latest Mega

790
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,230
couldn't have had a

791
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,790
rate limit to issue access right  that could

792
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,090
prevent you from even pretending it right the

793
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,270
broken function level position right

794
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,380
mass assignment settings and

795
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,180
safe injection they have  own of

796
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,550
assets insufficient recording and monitoring

797
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,680
or there is a series of one the

798
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,940
name of the exit of ap cycles top ten

799
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,420
and then the as docker Top has right here it

800
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,360
also says docker here but it is also used

801
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,660
for other types of containers ok so it

802
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:43,740
's just for the docker  So

803
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,420
this guy who talks about

804
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,790
secure user mapping

805
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,530
pet management strategy network separation

806
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,680
Faro Padre one and safe and hardening

807
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,380
right harding right keep

808
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,080
security context protect Secrets protect

809
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,630
resources integrity container image source

810
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,030
went to grid

811
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,120
immutable climate  and Register here folks,

812
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,410
you should have to pay close attention to

813
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,150
this issue of integrity origin of the

814
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,760
Container Store right because you only public

815
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,920
container anyway you can have it

816
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,710
containing unsafe there are punishment

817
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,410
of container even Doc

818
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,060
specifically Smith you alone a

819
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,770
shot of  Server even compromise the

820
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,920
server in this

821
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,830
and from the container you can get

822
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,350
to the server d  and origin and compromised the

823
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,920
server So here are tips to defeat a

824
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,660
touch sneaker scam right I'll give a series

825
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,210
of tools there for that ok

826
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,350
and not protecting accounts

827
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,080
vulnerabilities right Yeah you can have

828
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,310
one to follow so too ooa Circle in

829
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,820
Rats check list ok  It's a series of

830
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,920
secure code practices that

831
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,750
interesting to protect applications

832
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,530
is I do input validation right, avoid

833
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,570
touching scripts a series of

834
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,850
vulnerabilities notification output

835
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,260

error handling security communication

839
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,090

management memory management and

842
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:30,000
general communication practice hospital swearing TV there are

843
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,640
four so here a very rich source

844
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
also explains how to test

845
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,920
vulnerabilities and type of test for

846
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,810
each type of vulnerability.

847
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,230
they founded travel the world, right? So there's

848
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,220
a field of  landing of

849
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,099
one what I have to test on the side of the

850
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,670
system the virus could be people

851
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:57,180
if from Mauer the files ok the poode

852
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,869
extension ok it's a valid extension

853
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,930
content check content right lie down there

854
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,530
with what is content So there you go  So where are you

855
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,900
guys? To store

856
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,540
this file aside, then the cloud for a

857
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,190
Cloud has a series of tests and so

858
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,869
for each download a series of

859
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:19,480
tests for each thing the series of tests

860
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,150
at the stinger hospital here was

861
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,670
recently updated to be able to

862
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,789
work new ones  versions

863
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:29,910
ok so training a lot right we have

864
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,079
the citieffe of hacker one next is

865
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,880
interesting for those who are starting right

866
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,989
then get in there and train cool sigef

867
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:42,599
of rock one is how to make

868
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,759
their Shark card you can reach a

869
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:47,759
score that generates  invitations to

870
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,709
private buggy Bahls So that's interesting,

871
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:53,309
right, it went from 26 points if you win invitations

872
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:55,339
to the private bucket bath, right?

873
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:57,859


874
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:01,009
it can help with that

875
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:05,429
and also helps to arrest ok Jackman

876
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,919
kidding right one will see the pen

877
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:09,900
there is a test walks Into A bar

878
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,650
radius he asks for a grab Order a beer

879
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,679
I ask for a code to test

880
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,599
skeleton injection Cross site scripting and

881
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,979
playing will not a  a joke here

882
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:23,609
just to find it there, right but it's because

883
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:24,740
we

884
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,290
stay Catarina from there invading systems

885
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,990
in this space the security of the systems

886
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,510
actually right, I slacker own systems right

887
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,119
folks don't misunderstand me and in the

888
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,100
end we enter the site and already  it starts

889
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,690
there it

890
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,640
's another normal search and suddenly it's

891
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,040
already breaking there to see if it

892
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,010
finds a vulnerability, right then

893
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,410
that's it This custom is a joke,

894
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,869
thank you very much for your attention I hope you
