1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,120
foreign

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,860
it's intimidating and I can hear my

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,819
voice

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,700
as well uh thanks so much Jane that's a

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,620
great introduction I feel important now

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,920
so uh thank you and I'm in somewhat

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,839
intimidated expecting like two people

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,119
here or maybe 10 but it's the four room

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,300
almost

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,880
reporting for the at guy you know you

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,760
you're an IT guy or I.T person I I

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,080
should rather say be a politically

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,779
correct here and um you minding your own

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,880
business doing all this interesting

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,880
geeky stuff and then bam

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,860
you have to dress up now for your Zoom

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,780
call and then report to your Manco or

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
your board

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,579
ah would you start

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,820
what type of report should you produce

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,039
uh especially for such an important

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,620
presentation

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,140
before we jump into it I would like to

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,239
step back and uh

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,180
say thank you to the sponsors especially

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,760
the major ones and without you this

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
important conference wouldn't be

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,159
possible

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,840
uh

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,320
big thanks to the organizers the Amber

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,780
Lake guys I mean as uh folks in the just

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,400
unbelievable job to put this thing

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
together and thanks to all of you local

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,520
folks visitors to joining us for for

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,380
this important conference and this

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,820
beautiful Island

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880
oh yeah and uh all the best jokes thanks

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,939
to Chad GPT uh I'll let you spot those

39
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,979
throughout the presentation and the

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,939
Funky Art Is by Dolly

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,880
um it's my take on the augmented

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,799
artificial intelligence you know so

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,659
don't judge it's work in progress

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,700
now uh

45
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,320
if your name is Vladimir these days you

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,119
have to come with a disclaimer isn't it

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,079
so I like to think I'm a good Vlad

48
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,659
I didn't bring any cookies though uh

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,399
James told me there's a plenty of food

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,100
here if it's not that you know blame him

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,720
um but I hope that I brought a little

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,799
bit of a

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,419
knowledge or or ideas on how to start

54
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,280
reporting to you Mancos or to your

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,500
boards or to your client boards for

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,420
example

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,900
so let's jump in

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,620
we started to get engaged about you know

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,239
two three years ago

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,940
and realize there's really no blueprint

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,280
of where to start there's so many

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,500
different best practices there's a lot

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,620
of information on Google University tons

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,780
of stuff that you can go through but if

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,819
you just starting that kind of stuff

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,180
where do you go and we uh we provide the

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,040
compliance and risk and entity

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,140
governance but with the introduction of

69
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,780
cyber security guidelines by a local

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,160
regulator

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,580
more and more were being asked to

72
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,400
provide board reports to Mancos or or

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
the actual boards or they actually

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,540
present to the board themselves

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,420
so we kind of start building slowly but

76
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,640
surely a little bit of a model that I

77
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,140
would like to share with you

78
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,300
is everyone these days

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,459
I thought like hey you know why don't we

80
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,239
run this by AI

81
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,519
and Chad GPT we come to help in this

82
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,239
case uh I just realized there is a

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,540
grammar uh issue it's not a GPT it's

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,220
mine you you notice by now that English

85
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,580
is not my first language so

86
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,700
Chad GPT was pretty much spot on if you

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
think about it like you understand the

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,340
audience uh that's very applicable to

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,440
all these different uh meetings but

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,959
especially for this cyber security you

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,700
really need to assess your board members

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,940
their expertise in technology how

93
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,620
patient impatient they are how much time

94
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,019
they can allocate for you uh it

95
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,280
certainly needs to be focused on

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,680
business you can't just report silent

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,560
specifically to technology you need to

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,299
relate back to the to the business

99
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,239
whatever that is risk uh Financial

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,260
impact regulatory reputational make the

101
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,720
story together with the business

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,879
provide the context absolutely anything

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,339
you present during the uh your

104
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,019
presentation or in your board pack

105
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,860
should be factualized should be based on

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,360
some sort of Statistics or some

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,600
inclusive included reports and so on

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,820
Simplicity is a key make it quite

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,300
presentable no noise uh I don't know use

110
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,440
a traffic light approach make it uh

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
don't use a lot of technical lingo

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
abbreviations make like you know play in

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
English

114
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,240
uh offer Solutions as well and then you

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,580
know maybe some short-term long-term

116
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,080
Solutions throughout your presentation

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,020
or your board pack and kind of uh

118
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
created just not just the state of

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
current state of affairs of technology

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
or what you have done so far create this

121
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
type of continuous Improvement uh flow

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
when you do the presentation and last

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
but not least

124
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,720
um

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,780
show the Improvement make the story do

126
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,979
not report

127
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,400
on segment by segment basis pick up from

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,259
the last report and continue that story

129
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,960
so your board start getting used to that

130
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,580
you're constantly improving and

131
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,620
hopefully that's the case

132
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,060
so where do we start first what type of

133
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,259
sections can you introduce to the board

134
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,240
report and we we should start with the

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,000
risk register and um

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,520
I mean I assume that you have a risk

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,380
register already if you don't

138
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,080
that's something you need to consider

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,479
and we suggest they start with three

140
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,120
different sections or segments I would

141
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,940
say just you bring the basic one

142
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,120
uh just to show your Row in residual

143
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,840
risks kind of and and use a traffic

144
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
light approach but in this particular

145
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,240
case ignore your

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,699
low risks okay chances are you're bored

147
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,199
there's already approved this risk

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,479
appetite and

149
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,460
there's no reason to show something that

150
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,960
is already approved and part of your

151
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,060
risk appetite and just concentrate on a

152
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,039
high and medium show the row and show

153
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,020
the residual one and hopefully kind of

154
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,120
give the board the subliminal messaging

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
that your controls are are working

156
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,160
and also include the ownership chances

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,720
are some of those folks that own those

158
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,300
risks are with you

159
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,759
on this board presentation so you can

160
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,199
actually allow

161
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,900
board to

162
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,360
redirect the questions to the owners of

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
the risk

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,780
and you can kind of get them more

165
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,759
involved so you can you know Chief

166
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,620
compliance officer chief operation

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,020
officer it can be part of your story

168
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,900
part of your team when you deliver them

169
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,419
and um

170
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,900
bring those high and medium details to

171
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,639
your presentation you can certainly

172
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,979
include the full risk register as a part

173
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,560
of the board pack but

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,380
include those details and I like to use

175
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,560
this as an example I'm sure local folks

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,940
remember when we

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,940
had to put the beneficiary ownership in

178
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,460
the formation into those USB keys and

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,800
someone have to walk to the uh

180
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,440
government building and deposit it so

181
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,319
it's a really good example you yours

182
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,060
your policy should dictate

183
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,479
probably no USB storage but in this

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,280
particular case as an exception and your

185
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
board has to approve it and this you

186
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,419
have an opportunity to explain that to

187
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,440
the board

188
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
as well as allow them to ask you

189
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,539
questions so they can actually accept

190
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,340
that type of

191
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,940
um

192
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,919
risk during the during the meeting

193
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,960
incident section is very important even

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,120
even if you don't have incidents just

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,520
include that section because your board

196
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,440
will start getting used to your

197
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
structure of the reporting they can

198
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
actually look and see they're expecting

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
the incidents and if they're not it's a

200
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,139
good sign just make it hey non and green

201
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,340
but also

202
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,039
not necessarily consider capturing only

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,800
material incidents

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,979
think about significant interest as well

205
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,020
there could be some

206
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,660
basic or some sophisticated whaling

207
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,220
email that goes to your CEO or you have

208
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,479
some sort of brand jacking is taking

209
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,759
place someone tries to impersonate your

210
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,800
website something like that could be

211
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,599
quite interesting for your board to to

212
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,580
know because it potential leads to

213
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,820
material material event

214
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,479
fan testing do you reward these days uh

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
so I think the regulator almost demands

216
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,839
it to be at least annually so certainly

217
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,660
should introduce to your reporting as

218
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,120
well and take

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,700
um some sort of reporting out of it and

220
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,080
uh same idea just do a highlight on the

221
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,140
traffic light kind of model and in this

222
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,420
case maybe introduce well maybe like a

223
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,399
hybrid of traffic light introduce the

224
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,140
low ones and maybe even informational

225
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,060
ones as well

226
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,100
simplified for the board so that they

227
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,920
can understand what the findings are but

228
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,519
also be ready to respond with the

229
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,680
remediation steps remediation statuses

230
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
because chances are they'll ask okay

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,339
well someone discovered our website is

232
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,200
not up to date

233
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,060
what did you do about it so you can you

234
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,640
should be proactive and include these

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,459
type of statuses and be able to uh

236
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,800
respond to them should you include the

237
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,320
detailed report on pen test uh it's

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,820
really up to you and that's kind of

239
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
comes with you understand your board

240
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,140
better than anybody else

241
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,640
and in this case

242
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,980
some of those pen test reports that

243
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,320
could could be quite technical so who

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,700
knows if they're going to be beneficial

245
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,480
for you board or not

246
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,820
training awareness

247
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
a very important one and again uh

248
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,060
hopefully your clients or your companies

249
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,279
are doing it as frequently as possible

250
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,519
so get something that is

251
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,100
uh reportable I mean there's so many

252
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,380
different products out there that can

253
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,920
give you a nice details back and now you

254
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,500
can start with the correct and incorrect

255
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,200
responses but we also suggest including

256
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,240
participation because that's where the

257
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,300
where the the importance

258
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,120
um of that type of measurement is nice

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,220
to the report back to the board because

260
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,839
if there are a lot of incorrect

261
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,000
responses that's something to do with

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,380
your training you really need to take

263
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,080
and understand what needs to be done the

264
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
people don't participate they ignore

265
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,220
your training that's a different story

266
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,500
and you know it's a good opportunity

267
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,540
should you include a report in this type

268
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,660
of stuff I don't believe so because you

269
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,700
don't want to kind of Shame and blame

270
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,040
all these employees that actually not

271
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
participating enough or they're not

272
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,579
really answering certain things

273
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,800
correctly but at the same time it gives

274
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,060
you a good opportunity to create that a

275
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,100
newsletter concept where you're advising

276
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,320
your employees hey we actually start

277
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
reporting that statistics to the board

278
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
so it's better your responsibility to

279
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
take this seriously and attend those

280
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,380
sessions or respond to those emails from

281
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,200
IT team and participate in those

282
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,540
trainings because eventually that data

283
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,300
will be accessible to your Senior

284
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,540
Management

285
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,019
protective Tech

286
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,160
there's so many different different

287
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
reporting capabilities I'm sure you're

288
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
both aware there is a firewall and there

289
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,820
is some infrastructure in place but how

290
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,940
much do they know and it's your

291
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,220
responsibility to

292
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,500
simplify that type of reporting for them

293
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,279
and make it digestible so in this case I

294
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,560
mean this is just the simple examples I

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,079
mean hopefully your firewalls or the

296
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,360
infrastructure you have in place has the

297
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,680
type of capabilities intrusion

298
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,480
prevention detection systems can give

299
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,220
you that type of details that you can

300
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,240
build a nice story uh you can show

301
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
attack statistics you can show the

302
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,339
malware that traveling through your

303
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,440
infrastructure is it being into you know

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
captured on the affordable basis so you

305
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,240
let it in to your quarantine with the

306
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
email and it's being dealt that way it's

307
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,079
a nice statistic to show to the board

308
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,040
and also just uh in general what type of

309
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,899
activity are taking place in your

310
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,720
ecosystem so there's other people coming

311
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,339
into Wi-Fi with dropboxes are they using

312
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,500
uh you know personal vpns are they using

313
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,240
bittorrents I mean are they impacting

314
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,920
your bandwidth by using some of the on

315
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,740
um unlisted in your policies

316
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,240
applications that

317
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,980
that's certainly nice to to consider

318
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,680
help desk

319
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
a lot of internal auditors

320
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,420
and The Regulators now looking for

321
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,800
evidence so

322
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,320
you need to capture

323
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,779
your activity with uit throughout the

324
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,800
help desk

325
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,200
and this one is quite interesting you

326
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,940
can start with something that is could

327
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,820
be as simple as a resolution rate

328
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,700
and you can move from that simple

329
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,160
resolutionary to something more

330
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,920
sophisticated where you can show the

331
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,959
statistics of which department is more

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
active with the support which

333
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
application requires more support and

334
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,600
then build up on that kind of stuff

335
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,519
going forward

336
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,820
I don't know fishing another important

337
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,880
aspect of it regular loves to see some

338
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,920
of that going on I think it's maybe at

339
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,079
least annually that should be performing

340
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,320
again uh start with the basic maybe

341
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,300
something you know open and clicked

342
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,399
would be enough for the board to

343
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,800
understand hey how many employees and

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,860
percentage and statistically would click

345
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,320
on the link should we improve our

346
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,420
training cyber security awareness

347
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,500
training

348
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,820
should you include a report with that uh

349
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,339
uh with that presentation again probably

350
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,380
not because you don't want to shame and

351
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,940
blame your employees you want to kind of

352
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,459
go through that nice process and again

353
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,200
show the

354
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,380
uh board a general picture and then at

355
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,579
the same time come back to your

356
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,160
employees and explain that this type of

357
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,959
stuff is now being reported to the board

358
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,959
so they have to take it more seriously

359
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,120
uh just by the way piece of trivia for

360
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,700
you when I try to get a joke from chat

361
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,160
GPT and I put the hey give me a joke on

362
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,680
about phishing the response I got is

363
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,540
phishing is a serious matter and

364
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,399
shouldn't be joked about so that's why

365
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,560
you got the regular fish joke

366
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
foreign

367
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,459
for you to show your improvement this is

368
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,380
probably one of the best way to show

369
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,300
because you have your Senior Management

370
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,459
present you have your ultimate board

371
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,240
present and this is really good time to

372
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,240
find a way to quantify

373
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,260
your uh progress hopefully

374
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,420
the you know beneficial progress that

375
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,600
goes from one uh presentation to another

376
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,399
and that's where you're building your

377
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,899
story as well and there's so many

378
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,880
different ways how you can do it and it

379
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,420
doesn't have to be a scientific

380
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,880
calculation of quantification from one

381
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,680
presentation to another you can just say

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,260
hey we've done third-party assessment of

383
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,300
two vendors in the previous reporting

384
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,860
and now we're going through the new one

385
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,440
that's an improvement we've done some

386
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,360
upgrades of the firewalls or some

387
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,180
infrastructure that's an improvement you

388
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,839
with all the asynchronous and work from

389
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,180
home models these days we introduce

390
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,360
additional supporting mechanisms and

391
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,459
cyber security mechanism through the end

392
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,199
of to the end notes of those users

393
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,380
that's an improvement try to quantify it

394
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,540
and same in the policies nowadays

395
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,720
regulator demands that you review this

396
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,940
policy not just to write it once and

397
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,579
present it uh you know once and that's

398
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,540
it you have to constantly mature your

399
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,339
policies going forward and that's a good

400
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,320
opportunity to say hey we've done the

401
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,060
two policies before and then four

402
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,160
policies now that's an improvement from

403
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,000
ammo point of view

404
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,540
there are so many sections that you can

405
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,660
introduce to your

406
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,300
um to your reports and when you start

407
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,839
with something simple you can go through

408
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
the various different best practices you

409
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,959
can evaluate your

410
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,079
board or your Manco and uh go with some

411
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,620
of this specific sections it could be a

412
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,720
budget specific one usually it's going

413
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,060
with the management report but in this

414
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,620
case you can include some of the stuff

415
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,259
in your presentation you can introduce

416
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,360
different

417
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,740
sections like uh uh industry events or

418
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,079
some sort of activities that cyber

419
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,819
security activities that happen in the

420
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,679
in the industry and that would be quite

421
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,020
beneficial for the board to see that as

422
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,199
well

423
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,959
I really hope that some of the

424
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,020
information uh was kind of beneficial to

425
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,599
you you picked up some of the good

426
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,640
points from here and not just the bad

427
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,520
jokes but Chad GPT and uh

428
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,080
if you have any questions some have

429
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,179
tried to answer but thank you very much

430
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,919
and I should get some sort of a prize

431
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,980
for finishing in 25 minutes

432
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,400
well you know absolutely I mean if you

433
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,440
guys any I'll try to answer some of them

434
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,039
but um

435
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,660
oh wow that's that's perfect I actually

436
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,679
don't like to answer questions

437
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,450
thank you very much guys

438
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:08,539
[Applause]

439
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,740
Vlad I do have one question did you put

440
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,760
the joke content into chat GPT or did

441
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,720
you say I just want jokes on

442
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,880
does it still work oh

443
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,880
um so yeah you just asked a question and

444
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,100
say like hey give me a joke for this

445
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,860
particular topic and boom I had to kind

446
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,780
of ask a few times because some of them

447
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,860
were

448
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,280
okay Beyond even for me it was it was

449
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,500
difficult to understand so yeah but yeah

450
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,179
it's quite quite interesting

451
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,179
Vlad I've got another question and I'll

452
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,380
let you go

453
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,080
um with your experience in the ball

454
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,600
reporting how do you keep it fresh so

455
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,320
you've got this information coming maybe

456
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,179
monthly quarterly to the board

457
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,280
they're kind of you know their eyes may

458
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
be glazing over the kind of traffic

459
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,940
light system and actually the underlying

460
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,039
kind of what you really want is like a

461
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,299
check and challenge of the Senior

462
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,799
Management at the CSO to kind of say

463
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,320
like what is actually how do you with

464
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,240
your kind of experience and gamifying a

465
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,039
little bit how do you keep that

466
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,720
how do you keep that dialogue fresh and

467
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,460
how do you keep them engaged like month

468
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
after month when it's often the same

469
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,020
topics and actually the dial is not

470
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,520
maybe moving as quickly as it needs to

471
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,059
be any tips absolutely it's a great

472
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,160
point and it's similar that we do with

473
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
our cyber security awareness uh training

474
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,380
as well so we we try to introduce some

475
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,299
of the activities that

476
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,580
I have taken place in the industry

477
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,039
something cool stuff like

478
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,520
a deep fake voice uh the other day maybe

479
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,100
a few years ago someone impersonated

480
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
with a deep fake and be able to transfer

481
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,860
35 million dollars in in Dubai uh but

482
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,200
it's simply uh impersonating someone

483
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,419
with a voice with a callback so some of

484
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,160
the stuff we kind of introduced in the

485
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,299
middle and some of those additional

486
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,520
sections and say hey uh this is what

487
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
really happened uh uh in the industry so

488
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
you're part of your procedure is called

489
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,179
back when someone requests the

490
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,880
transaction for example hey with the new

491
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
technology the defect voice now you can

492
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,900
actually impersonate someone so some

493
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,320
things that to to that to the extent

494
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
um you also mix and match some of the uh

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,120
reporting so for example you're

496
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,700
reporting on uh your protective

497
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,740
technology in one way and then you mix

498
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,720
it up a little bit to next time so you

499
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,580
can actually introduce uh maybe

500
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,640
additional specifics that you found uh

501
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,980
in the firewalls for example but make it

502
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,419
very simple uh you usually

503
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,240
when you engage in this case uh for some

504
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,500
of the clients you have an internal

505
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,480
audit that it takes a little bit of time

506
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,179
as well because uh once a year or so you

507
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,160
have to present on what the findings are

508
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,260
from the internal radar so that kind of

509
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,780
mixes up a little bit as well so and

510
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,760
that's at the end of the day it's really

511
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,220
it's really up to you uh it's difficult

512
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,400
so you we have uh boards that consist of

513
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
two people and have boards that consist

514
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,020
of six so you just you really have to

515
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,600
read your your room which I'm not doing

516
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,660
very well here but uh yeah but and uh

517
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,160
yeah so I actually it's really a good

518
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,280
point will someone actually compared my

519
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,320
initial training to a dentist

520
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,020
appointment or a colonoscopy so take

521
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,200
that I recover after this you know and

522
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
we did so it was it was it was pretty

523
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,820
boring in the beginning but we tried to

524
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,439
make it as interesting as possible

525
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,059
I should run away probably like you know

526
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,620
no I have a question thanks so much

527
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,949
[Laughter]
