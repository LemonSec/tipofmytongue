1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,360
foreign

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,860
before I get started I just wanted to

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,240
take a few minutes and say a few things

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,300
first of all I wanted to let you guys

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,400
know how absolutely fortunate you really

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,179
are

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,460
I have had the privilege of speaking at

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
b-sides conferences literally all over

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,619
the world from Barcelona to Texas to the

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,880
Caymans

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,460
you name it I think Toronto I think I've

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,820
done like 23 different b-sides and to be

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,019
honest

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
you know RJ if you haven't met him out

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,279
there please take the time to do so the

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,980
organizers here he asked me last night

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
what is my favorite b-sides and why and

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,820
the truth is it's this one

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,040
and it's not for the reasons that you

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,899
would think oh we'll get to that in a

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
minute

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,100
this in my opinion is probably one of

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,379
the most authentic b-sides that I have

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,780
ever been to this is truly Community

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,340
Driven

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,500
you know between James RJ Ozzie Diamond

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,300
you guys have put together in my opinion

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,140
one of the best conferences for an

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,479
actual Community Driven you know cyber

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,720
security event and I am honored and

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,340
grateful for the opportunity to come

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,200
back but you guys have done an amazing

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,320
job so quick Round of Applause for the

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,400
organizers and for besides

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,140
[Applause]

36
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,700
so having done that

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,900
let's have some fun

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,000
so thank you guys for coming

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,960
uh the title track for my talk today is

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,600
called synthetic identity

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,860
all right let's see if we can figure out

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,759
the fancy Clicker oh it works all right

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,579
so if you didn't catch me last year my

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,540
name is len no n-o-e so I am a technical

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,759
evangelist a white hat and a biohacker

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,119
for cyber Arc software uh if you're

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,340
wondering about the biohacker thing my

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,320
best advice is to actually look up my

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,420
talk from b-sides came in last year you

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740
can check that out

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,899
uh I've spent the better part of my life

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,538
actually as a black or a gray hat and

53
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,480
came to the security side of things kind

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,780
of in an unnatural way uh I basically

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,940
started having grandkids

56
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,739
and decided that you know if I don't

57
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,020
want to see have my grandkids meeting me

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,760
behind bars I needed to make some

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,020
changes

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,260
and in doing so it basically gave me the

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,300
opportunity to take the skill set that I

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,000
had Acquired and that whole think like

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
an attacker methodology mentality I

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,720
don't have to worry about trying to

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
think like an attacker because I am an

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
attacker

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm also one of as I said one of the

68
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,300
world's thought leaders in bio-humanism

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,160
or transhumanism

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
uh uh if you're not familiar what that

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,780
is I am actually an augmented human with

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,580
about 10 different microchips in my

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,280
hands that I use for offensive security

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,140
uh I'm extremely active on social media

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,720
uh I have all my contact information up

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
there feel free to reach out over

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
LinkedIn check out my YouTube My GitHub

78
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,379
and follow me on Twitter for additional

79
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,420
security related stuff

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,680
so

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,700
let's get into the nitty-gritty

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,260
identity

83
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,780
identity seems to be the big word in the

84
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,920
industry today

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,140
we hear about identity theft identity

86
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,659
monitoring identity validation identity

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,659
security everything is tied to Identity

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,060
and and with very good reason our

89
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,500
identities are the most valuable thing

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,080
that we possess it's our likeness our

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,420
voice our Behavior patterns it's our

92
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,239
friends our families our Hobbies likes

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,080
and dislikes it's what makes us us

94
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,720
but is it the physical us is it the

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
digital us

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
and is there even a difference between

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
the two anymore

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,640
you know I think it's a really good idea

99
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,019
for us to start with just a simple

100
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,819
definition so we can all be on the same

101
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,040
page for the purposes of this talk

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,920
according to the Oxford dictionary

103
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,060
identity is the unique set of

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,620
characteristics that can be used to

105
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,680
identify a person as themselves and no

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,780
one else and this is the context that

107
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,980
we're going to be using for the rest of

108
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,540
the talk today

109
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,280
when we look at all the data that we

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,199
actually just leak during our normal

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,358
day-to-day life we can see how quite a

112
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,738
bit of this information can actually be

113
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,139
weaponized against us and it's my hope

114
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,400
that by the end of this presentation

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,040
that we'll see that when we talk about

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,580
identity it's all encompassing and the

117
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,740
perceived lines that we've drawn to

118
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,180
separate the different facets of

119
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,160
ourselves simply don't exist anymore

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,919
so this brings us

121
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,139
to synthetic identity

122
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,520
you know so let's look at the bigger

123
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,320
scope for just a minute

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,020
we have our physical identities we have

125
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,300
our individual digital Footprints we

126
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,860
have computer identities and the

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,360
multiple accounts that encompasses the

128
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,820
full scope of Who We Are

129
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,919
with account sprawl as well as data

130
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,660
Harvesters basically in every single

131
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,259
application every purchase we do wants

132
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,139
you our email wants us to take a survey

133
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,800
The Human Experience is for sale and the

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,479
Market's good

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
fishing and targeted spear fishing are

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,199
becoming more and more effective due to

137
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,820
the availability of what we used to

138
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,699
consider pii that we're now just giving

139
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,160
away as part of eulas

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,259
we see targeted Advertising based on our

141
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,660
search patterns and data analytics we

142
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,520
see doxing in the public disclosure of

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
individuals for nefarious purposes in

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,440
the news pretty normalized these days

145
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,600
we have ai chat Bots that are in the

146
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,820
news almost daily now

147
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,500
we've been the commodity for quite some

148
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,380
time and I don't think people realize

149
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,580
just how valuable this type of

150
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
information is

151
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,600
what if we were to see the melding of

152
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Predictive Analytics combined with AI

153
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,699
used against all the information that

154
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,380
we're leaving behind

155
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,360
this is the synthetic identity that I

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,440
just mentioned

157
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,780
it's not an individual but more of a

158
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,580
collection of an individual's behaviors

159
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,100
mannerisms interests likes dislikes

160
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,820
posts essentially everything that we do

161
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,740
depending on the size of the data model

162
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,539
and the online activities of an

163
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,160
individual there's a very high

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
probability of analytical success from

165
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
that type of a data set

166
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,280
think about all the little nuances we do

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,560
when we're online things that nobody

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,060
else would notice

169
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,919
unless they were actually watching us

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,740
every single minute of every single day

171
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,419
we have the ability to interact with

172
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,060
that data in a user-friendly way now and

173
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,139
I'm actually going to be demonstrating

174
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,280
that to you before the end of this

175
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
presentation

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,160
so we live in a digital world let's look

177
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,960
how every aspect of Our Lives has

178
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
basically turned digital

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,100
everything from Smart TVs and the to the

180
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,300
cars we drive

181
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,560
everything has a username and a password

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
every service wants to know more and

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,400
more about you and your life

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,900
think about the last time you were able

185
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,780
to do anything without the need of some

186
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,900
tech stack behind the scenes

187
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,419
practically everything we do wants some

188
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,759
information from us as the user every

189
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,259
business or service wants to know more

190
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,300
about us do some you're going to go

191
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,340
grocery shopping get a loyalty card so

192
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,380
they can send you targeted coupons

193
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,500
want to buy a new car take the survey

194
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,900
need a doctor they want to know every

195
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,360
aspect of your life the requests for

196
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,400
your data are everywhere if you actually

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,259
stop to look

198
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,699
there are even some parts of our

199
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,800
national infrastructure that have

200
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,360
actually been converted to Smart devices

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
and there the this is the only way they

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,599
work now there is no way to do these

203
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,500
particular functions manually anymore

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,919
there are even everything is asking us

205
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,199
our physical identities to attach to

206
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
more and more Digital Services

207
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
every time we add a new app or a mobile

208
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,639
device another piece of software

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
is asking for permissions to reach

210
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
deeper and deeper into our private lives

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
and our individual beings

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,120
so

213
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,940
you know we've all seen

214
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,560
to look at our life very

215
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
compartmentalized

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,060
for example we see our work life very

217
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,400
different than our home or personal life

218
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,500
but the truth is there's so much overlap

219
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,819
we don't even see the forest for the

220
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,220
trees anymore

221
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,620
anybody that has ever been to one of my

222
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,759
talks before has probably heard me say

223
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,800
the days of keeping the bad guys out and

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
keeping them on the DMZ just doesn't

225
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,620
work anymore

226
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,958
not that we don't want the security but

227
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,279
we've moved into a different type of

228
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,500
Technology model this is a world where

229
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,479
corporate assets are not stored on

230
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,458
corporate properties anymore

231
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,260
this is a world where we are seeing more

232
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,240
and more business use on our personal

233
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,540
devices BYOD is essentially commonplace

234
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,180
we have more remote workers now post

235
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,420
pandemic than ever

236
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,860
yeah we do everything we can from

237
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,000
endpoint security anti-virus EDR xdr

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,260
BitLocker hell I could talk for another

239
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,000
three hours up here of different

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,339
security controls out there but the

241
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,680
truth is as soon as these devices leave

242
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,320
our environments we just gotta hope that

243
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,779
we've done our jobs correctly as well as

244
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,880
hoping that our end users remain

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,920
Vigilant in their efforts to keep the

246
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
company safe

247
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,760
you know we sit back and watch our

248
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,380
laptops and our mobile devices walk out

249
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,720
into the world that as we as Security

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,779
Professionals know is a digital war zone

251
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,279
what's the first thing that's likely to

252
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,839
happen when we take an asset out of a

253
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,820
company

254
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,200
anybody

255
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
what are we going to do with it

256
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,160
bingo

257
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,779
these assets are probably either going

258
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,399
to be plugged in or logged into a home

259
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,200
network

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
and let's be honest on our home networks

261
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,700
do we have this anywhere near the same

262
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,040
number of controls that we have in a

263
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,540
corporate environment

264
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,820
how many of us are doing patch

265
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Management on our routers our Nas home

266
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,860
Nas devices

267
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,720
and God help us if you've got a smart

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,700
house and you've got iot

269
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,899
you know

270
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,820
do you have a system for updates in your

271
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,980
for your home technology do you have a

272
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,080
life cycle management for your internal

273
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,160
devices

274
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,080
for the second time we're not going to

275
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,839
go down the iot and smart road but think

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,480
about it maybe we got to share your home

277
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,800
internet

278
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,839
here's one that should be relatively

279
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,180
easily recognizable

280
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,700
everybody here remember no Minecraft

281
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,560
oh yeah

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,420
maybe you're like me you got kids you've

283
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,640
got grandkids

284
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
some people may not be aware that

285
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
Minecraft is actually used to teach

286
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
computer science to elementary and

287
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,980
middle school children to try and get

288
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,440
them to understand code

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,300
but at the same time

290
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,860
depending on which version of Minecraft

291
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,079
you're running that is extremely

292
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,579
susceptible to log 4J

293
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,320
what if somebody in your household

294
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,440
is using the BitTorrent Network

295
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,700
you know currently the estimation is

296
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,579
what is it I think it's two out of three

297
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,980
binaries on the torrent Network

298
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,620
currently it contains some form of

299
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,519
payload be it a rat a Trojan or a virus

300
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,680
so our attack surface is literally

301
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,940
everywhere

302
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,160
and we haven't even brought up machine

303
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,959
identities yet

304
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,519
and how that can actually accelerate

305
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,980
account sprawl and overlap

306
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,320
how many self-service portals are using

307
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,300
the exact same questions

308
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,339
I mean if I'm using my mother's maiden

309
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,860
name for my Netflix is it that my mother

310
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,260
same mother's maiden name that I would

311
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,839
be using on my Office 365 self-service

312
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,760
recovery

313
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,220
do I have two mothers maiden names

314
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,959
and is this something that publicly we

315
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,380
could get

316
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,519
you know let's if we look at some of the

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
Digital Trends and the numbers

318
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,579
you know these this data was taken from

319
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,740
July of 2022.

320
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,019
the total world population around that

321
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,760
time was hovering right around 8 billion

322
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,019
globally

323
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,579
now let's use that as the comparison

324
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,800
point the total number of online users

325
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
at that same time

326
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,420
was around 5.3 billion

327
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,959
social media users at the same time

328
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,220
4.7 billion

329
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,959
e-commerce

330
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,480
4 billion users

331
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,060
you know I love numbers numbers don't

332
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,620
lie

333
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,740
then we can look at the AI

334
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,399
chat GPT actually set a world record for

335
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,839
1 million users in its first week

336
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,839
35 of all companies right now are

337
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,940
investing some type of capabilities or

338
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,800
investment into technology related

339
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
around AI

340
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
and 44 of the private sector companies

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,139
plan to invest in AI this year alone one

342
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,160
moment please

343
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,680
I've said it before I'm from Texas I can

344
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
handle Heat

345
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,579
but the humidity here is causing me to

346
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,920
melt like a Snowman

347
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,180
apologies

348
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,279
so

349
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,260
so these are the technologies that are

350
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,220
coming at us Fast and Furious

351
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,740
so I told you that today's talk was

352
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,320
about synthetic identity so how do we

353
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,459
create

354
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,579
a synthetic identity

355
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,019
we're going to start by talking a little

356
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,880
bit about oscent

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
if you're not if you've never heard this

358
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,980
term before osin stands for open source

359
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,380
information technology

360
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,940
and as defined by the United States

361
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,639
Public Law this is intelligence gathered

362
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
from publicly available sources that is

363
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
used to address specific intelligence

364
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,160
needs

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
the U.S Director of National

366
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,980
Intelligence and the Department of

367
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,380
Defense also cite this definition

368
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,480
according to Nato considering that's a

369
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,700
little bit broader scope oscent includes

370
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,899
information from publicly available

371
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,240
sources as well as other unclassified

372
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,220
information that is not widely

373
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,360
distributed

374
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,279
so basically this is public information

375
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,680
there's no hacking involved

376
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
that's one of the key points I want to

377
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,240
make about oscent this is not hacking to

378
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,279
get information this is just leveraging

379
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,680
information that is already there that

380
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,380
people may not be excuse me that people

381
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,320
may not know where to look to find

382
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,940
and this is the heading that the rest of

383
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,279
this talk is actually going to be under

384
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,660
we're going to start off by taking a

385
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,740
look at some of the bigger commercial

386
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,139
operations that are available for a fee

387
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,000
a couple of examples of these would be

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Checker been verified First Advantage

389
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
maybe you've used some of these services

390
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,320
in the past

391
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,079
you know then we have the open source

392
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,120
tools and for the purposes of today's

393
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,500
discussion we're actually going to be

394
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,620
going over three different ocent tools

395
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,779
iky which is I know you

396
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,360
spider foot and blackbird

397
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,699
each one of these tools will add a

398
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,800
little bit more information to our

399
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,779
synthetic identity

400
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,199
so let's go ahead and show you guys what

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
this actually looks like in real life

402
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,839
so before we get started into the actual

403
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,360
meat and potatoes of the video take a

404
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,639
look at this

405
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,180
for the sake of argument and in the for

406
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,220
the purposes of full disclosure I'm

407
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,300
going to tell you guys you're going to

408
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,399
find out some things about me today that

409
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,500
I if you guys were in the same position

410
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,440
you may not want up on this screen

411
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,720
but the truth is everything that I'm

412
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,579
going to show you today any single one

413
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,440
of you would be able to go out and get

414
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
the same information

415
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,820
but this is from a pay service called

416
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,740
been verified

417
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,680
this is on the header page of every

418
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,019
single report that you run

419
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,519
and if you look at what it says and I

420
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,660
know it might be hard to read from there

421
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,220
so I'm going to read it for you

422
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,860
please remember you are restricted from

423
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,779
using this information for employment

424
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,620
screening hiring of household workers

425
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,839
tenant screening for housing educational

426
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,720
qualifications credit or insurance

427
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,180
purposes or business transactions

428
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
initiated by an individual

429
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,820
so if you're not allowed to use this

430
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,360
information for any of those purposes

431
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,839
what is the legitimate use case

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,579
there isn't one

433
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,639
it's somebody just selling our data for

434
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,380
the sake of selling it

435
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,699
so let me show you what it actually

436
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,980
looks like

437
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,660
hello

438
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,440
thank you so this has been verified and

439
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm actually not going to obfuscate any

440
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,920
of this

441
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,800
because you can go to the same app run

442
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
the same report and find the exact same

443
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,220
thing

444
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,160
so there I am Leonard Keith no 48 years

445
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,620
old Austin Texas

446
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,660
so let's actually go ahead and run this

447
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,399
and show you the kind of information

448
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,880
that we are making monetizable

449
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,639
I'm 48 years old I was born in 1974.

450
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,160
that is my home address that is my phone

451
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,240
number

452
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,679
that is one of my email addresses

453
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,559
so social media

454
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,140
some of these are my social media

455
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,299
accounts

456
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,220
look at what the headers are there on

457
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,319
the left phone numbers email addresses

458
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,819
address history relatives name ancestry

459
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,780
names Associates Neighbors

460
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,939
jobs and education

461
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,740
I can even run criminal background

462
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,080
checks in here possible owned assets

463
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,860
that's my car

464
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,360
that's a truck that I sold four years

465
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,500
ago

466
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,419
that Jeep Wrangler I got rid of almost

467
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,419
15 years ago

468
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,520
so that Explorer sport track a long time

469
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,080
ago

470
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,460
we're starting to see a pattern here

471
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,960
I can look up DEA license weapons

472
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,559
permits professional licenses

473
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,780
you know I'm just running through here

474
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,400
how about Associates these are people

475
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,620
that are known to be affiliated with me

476
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,719
some of these are some of my ex-in-laws

477
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
you getting the point yet

478
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,320
how about relatives that's my wife

479
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
that's my daughter

480
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
this is my ex-wife's husband that's my

481
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,860
ex-wife

482
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,620
that's my ex-wife's current husband but

483
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,320
you also notice there are dates when

484
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
these are available

485
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,660
so that's my mom that's my dad that's my

486
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,980
brother that's my sister-in-law

487
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,780
pretty scary

488
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,980
and it's only going to get worse

489
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,500
there's my employment history cyberark

490
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,620
ADP westnet Technologies

491
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,660
education

492
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,520
there are some of the acloud guru

493
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,980
there's the college I went to New

494
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,520
Horizons

495
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,320
that's a lot of information

496
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,480
there's all the places that it knows

497
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,039
that I've lived in the past if we're

498
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
looking and get this one all the way

499
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,960
down here you see that one on Cowan Road

500
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,640
that was my first apartment when I was

501
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,299
19 years old

502
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,059
every single address that I've ever

503
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,080
lived at

504
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,400
with the exception of when I lived in

505
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,720
Puerto Rico

506
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,620
is on that list

507
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,020
so you have family members relatives

508
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,780
previous addresses

509
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,020
and that was the commercial stuff

510
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,620
what about went back went too far

511
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,020
what about the open source tools that I

512
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,559
was telling you about

513
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,880
so I'm gonna let's run those

514
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,059
I'm gonna fire off all three tools and

515
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,220
we're going to show you iky we're going

516
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,840
to show you spider foot and we're going

517
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,660
to show you Blackbird iky is an email

518
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,799
scanner

519
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,100
Blackbird is a username scanner and

520
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,559
spider foot is basically the ultimate

521
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,160
Swiss army knife for searching

522
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,440
and we're going to fire up all three so

523
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,780
this is iky

524
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,299
we're gonna fire off spider foot and all

525
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm going to put in here into iky is my

526
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
business email

527
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,700
.no at cyberark.com

528
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,980
we're going to let that run

529
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,160
anybody that knows me knows that I go by

530
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,220
a hacker handle of hacker213

531
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,200
so we're going to use Blackbird and

532
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,940
we're going to search almost 600

533
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,039
websites for the existence of an account

534
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
named hackery213 and we're going to go

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,720
into spider foot and we're going to do a

536
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,840
full web scan for the individual name of

537
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,039
Leno

538
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,660
and then we're going to see what type of

539
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,600
stuff we can come back with

540
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,820
spider foot will actually let you do

541
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,880
email addresses domain sub domains

542
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,140
IP addresses users reverse phone lookups

543
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,820
pretty much anything that you could ever

544
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,380
imagine

545
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,059
so

546
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,460
as these do take a few seconds to run

547
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,340
keep in mind when we see these I do not

548
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,160
own every account that is hacker213 I

549
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,160
own a lot of them but not all of them

550
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,860
so let's go back to iky and remember

551
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,740
this started with just my business email

552
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,960
account

553
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,160
found my industry found my company

554
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,600
if you look over on the left here you'll

555
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,399
see an email reputational details

556
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,260
down on the lower right the leak graph

557
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,299
from any leak Maps

558
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,880
social media accounts

559
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,400
social user scan

560
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,740
then we get down it found an Eventbrite

561
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,200
page from one of my previous talks where

562
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
somebody signed up

563
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,799
and now we're going to get down into the

564
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,500
Yandex and the actual web searches

565
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,120
let's see what we find

566
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,799
because I'm a public speaker and I've

567
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,500
done a lot of interviews podcasts

568
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,360
there's a lot of information out there

569
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,340
on the web about me

570
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,559
you know so it's going to actually give

571
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
you raw data as well as analyze search

572
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,580
results

573
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,020
and through all of this information

574
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,360
we're still going

575
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,820
possible other usernames hashtags I've

576
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,200
been Associated let's go into profile

577
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,760
keep in mind this is my work email

578
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
address wow it found the places I've

579
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,400
lived other possible emails found my my

580
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,320
actual phone number

581
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,179
and this is just off of my business

582
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,280
account

583
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,559
found a bunch of the social media tools

584
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,320
that we use at Cyber Arc

585
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,059
the every one of these that are green

586
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,480
there is an account named hacker213

587
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,580
again I don't own all of them

588
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,200
but if you want to try and find the

589
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
attack landscape and actually try and

590
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,919
get to me

591
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,179
you just found a bunch of information

592
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,679
I bring this up

593
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,080
this here is a LinkedIn profile that I

594
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,900
found about two years ago

595
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,179
that's not me

596
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,159
and what I find really really troubling

597
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
about this is look how many followers

598
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,880
there are

599
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,700
and that is not me

600
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,280
that is a counterfeit

601
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,980
I knew about this one remember I we

602
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,679
kicked off that uh Spider foot scan and

603
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,299
said scan the entire internet for

604
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,539
anything that's related to Leno

605
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,520
this is what I found When I Was

606
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
preparing for this talk if we go under

607
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,720
social media presence

608
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,700
I actually came down here went what the

609
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,980
hell is this

610
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,360
this

611
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,760
is another counterfeit account

612
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,799
that I had no idea was even out there

613
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,419
so it becomes very very easy

614
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,280
to manipulate

615
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,919
so now that we've seen a little bit of

616
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,860
what I can do from just a commercial and

617
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,299
people finder as well as like some

618
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,700
opengnu tools but we haven't even talked

619
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,799
about the companies that we have to

620
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,380
divulge pii to in order to even access

621
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,940
their services

622
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm going to talk about the big tech

623
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,780
companies that we have integrated into

624
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,000
the fabric of our lives in order from

625
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
worst

626
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,760
to the best

627
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,299
when it comes to data collection

628
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,580
what do you think is the largest what

629
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,500
big tech company is the one that's

630
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,480
collecting the most on us anybody throw

631
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,980
it out

632
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,659
Facebook wrong

633
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,320
Google

634
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,260
tops the list and collects 39 different

635
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,780
types of data from its date users daily

636
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,780
across all of its products and services

637
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,580
stores everything from domains including

638
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,080
a lot of private data like browser

639
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,539
history location history user activity

640
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,000
on third-party apps Your Health Data

641
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
from Google Health it also stores every

642
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,000
single email from your Gmail account

643
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,740
for fun

644
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,140
if you're a Google Android User you want

645
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,760
to know how deeply Google is ingrained

646
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
into your life

647
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,780
go look at your Google timeline

648
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,120
you take a picture it'll geo-locate it

649
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,340
and put it on a on a nice little chart

650
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,000
that will tell you the time location

651
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,940
metadata you can't get away from it

652
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,100
who who do you think the next one worst

653
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,820
is

654
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,340
somebody come on throw it up

655
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,320
who's who's the next worse data

656
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,678
Harvester

657
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,220
Twitter

658
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,380
Twitter collects 24 different types of

659
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,720
information from its customers

660
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,299
and the thing is if you actually look at

661
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,760
Twitter's privacy policy

662
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,299
it says write in their privacy policy

663
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,400
everything you post on the platform is

664
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,840
available to third parties through

665
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,580
programming interfaces

666
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,380
this allows businesses to comb through

667
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,480
Twitter and analyze your data to learn

668
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,460
as much about you as possible so that

669
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,260
they can do targeted advertising

670
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,340
directly to you

671
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,940
next

672
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:03,440
yeah Amazon sorry

673
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,679
Amazon comes next

674
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,299
23 different types of data and honestly

675
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,980
Amazon in my opinion is one of the ones

676
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,860
that scares me the most

677
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,779
Amazon can collect your name addresses

678
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,880
searches recordings when you're

679
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,039
interacting with your Alexa all of your

680
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,940
orders content you watch on Prime

681
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,900
contacts if you've enabled the email

682
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,740
feature as well as cookies

683
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,020
you know according to Amazon it's for

684
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,360
personalization

685
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,220
and that's just big Tech speak for using

686
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,480
your data improves your online

687
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,860
experience

688
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,320
but you may not realize it can reveal an

689
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,779
absolute ton about you for example if

690
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,779
you use just Amazon's retail store

691
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,720
or via the website or an app Amazon will

692
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,700
collect data such as the purchase dates

693
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,279
payment and delivery information and

694
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,260
according to Rwanda Felding who is the

695
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,700
director of data protection and

696
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,640
consultancy Miss IG geek from that

697
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,100
information alone Amazon can work out

698
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,460
where you work where you live how you

699
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
spend your leisure time and who your

700
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,820
friends and family are

701
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,340
just from ordering on Amazon

702
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,679
and at the same time Prime video and

703
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,080
Fire TV information about you they can

704
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,080
figure out potentially your politics

705
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,840
religion culture and economical status

706
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,580
just based off of what you're you're

707
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,600
viewing on Amazon

708
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,220
Facebook come Facebook comes in fourth

709
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,279
with 14 different types of data

710
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,200
Believe It or Not apple is the most

711
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,419
privacy conscious of all of the big Tech

712
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,179
they only are nice enough to collect 12

713
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,700
different types of data

714
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,760
account information device footprinting

715
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,360
payment info transaction information

716
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,279
fraud prevention data usage data

717
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,740
location health and anything shared

718
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,539
directly with apple under your Apple

719
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,100
account

720
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,080
you know these are the ones that we have

721
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,080
to basically give up a lot of pii in

722
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,880
order to use their services

723
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,740
but we haven't even talked about the

724
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,419
wonderful things that we'll sign up for

725
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,440
things like classmates or ancestry

726
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,580
and if you're not familiar with

727
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,440
classmates because it's an older site

728
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,820
that doesn't get a lot of you know

729
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,260
notoriety anymore

730
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,720
this is essentially a social media site

731
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
that allows you to stay in contact with

732
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,860
people you went to elementary school

733
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,320
with Junior High School high school and

734
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,179
college

735
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,760
if you haven't figured out yet where

736
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,380
we're going with this talk

737
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,120
we've kind of talked about a lot of

738
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,039
things that might be self-service

739
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,620
recovery question answers aren't we

740
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,840
so if we take a look at the actual data

741
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,220
science

742
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,620
it shouldn't come as a surprise that

743
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,500
hacking and data science they both have

744
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,480
a lot in common despite being on

745
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,059
opposite sides of the legality

746
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,640
you know we have everything from

747
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
utilizing

748
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,500
AI for

749
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,620
targeted spear phishing we see AI being

750
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,559
utilized to create new types of malware

751
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,539
and ransomware that we've never seen

752
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,840
before

753
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,340
you know and I believe the reason that

754
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,380
it's happening is because we now have

755
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,240
access to these types of services that

756
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
we never had before

757
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,200
AI was typically reserved for

758
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,740
universities and governments now when we

759
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,480
see we have open AI we have things like

760
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,419
mid Journey we have Google AI

761
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,539
uh chat GPT is being integrated into the

762
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,000
Bing search bar we're putting this stuff

763
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,700
everywhere

764
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,100
cyber Arc Labs even was able to use chat

765
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,340
GPT to create polymorphic malware

766
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,159
you know and if AI isn't such a scary

767
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,559
thing why is it that the government is

768
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,179
looking to actually create regulations

769
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,980
around it

770
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,380
you know we talk about real world

771
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,539
threats this was actually a public

772
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:58,740
service announcement that came out in

773
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,980
2022 stating that

774
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,200
people were uh Bad actors were actually

775
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
trying to get remote I.T jobs

776
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,200
using stolen pii

777
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,720
these are actually two identity markets

778
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,039
off the dark net

779
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,179
if you look you can get an American

780
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,100
passport for as little as two thousand

781
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,080
dollars

782
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,299
I wanted to show you this one

783
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,760
order process after buying an ID or

784
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,380
passport send us a message with your age

785
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,820
and gender so we can find a matching

786
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,320
data set

787
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,279
where do you think they're getting the

788
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,480
data sets

789
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
it's all of our stolen identities

790
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,299
we're seeing AI use in the wild we see

791
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,179
police and governments using AI for

792
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,760
predictive models for crowd control in

793
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,260
different scenarios

794
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,679
we have new companies like syntelx these

795
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,419
if you look at their website they

796
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,700
specialize in intelligence and law

797
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,960
enforcement

798
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,980
we can even now get a master's degree in

799
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,140
criminal justice data analytics

800
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,419
so this is now going to be a very big

801
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,760
part of the our future so let me ask you

802
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,679
guys the questions after seeing all the

803
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,299
kind of things that I just was able to

804
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,039
pull you think I could figure out what

805
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,779
street you grew up on

806
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,159
what about your the elementary school

807
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,480
you went to

808
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,220
your first car

809
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,080
how about your relative's birthday

810
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
maybe your mother's maiden name

811
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,980
even your first job

812
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,960
realistically anyone with LinkedIn we've

813
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,520
turned our LinkedIn profiles into a

814
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,740
living resume

815
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,299
so let me set the stage for you guys

816
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,740
here

817
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,020
I took all of the information that I was

818
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,480
able to get from been verified as well

819
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,760
as all of my osent searches

820
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,840
I shoved them all into chat GPT

821
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
and then I said

822
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,220
let's see if I can interact with this

823
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,200
so here we go

824
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,520
tell me about Len no

825
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,559
well Len is a technical evangelist and

826
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,960
white hat for cyborg oh gee this kind of

827
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220
looks more or less just like one of my

828
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,960
BIOS that I would put out for one of my

829
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,220
talks

830
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,380
not really impressed

831
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,659
I mean it worded it nicer than me

832
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,820
tell me more about Leno

833
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,620
okay let's see what it comes up to this

834
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,580
time

835
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,320
lenza technical evangelists pretty much

836
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,760
the same stuff that we had in the first

837
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,860
paragraph not oh wait

838
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,140
one unique he's a biohacker or a

839
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,340
transhumanist

840
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,620
uh oh he's also appeared on various

841
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,480
podcasts okay we're starting to get some

842
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,760
information out here

843
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
tell me about Len's family

844
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,080
this one shocked the hell out of me my

845
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,700
parents Leonard Keith and Donna Fey

846
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,299
Brothers Tracy and Trevor is Grant

847
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,640
granddaughters oh what his grandkids

848
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,059
call him Robo Papa which is true

849
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,559
it took my my relatives from one scan

850
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,600
took a quote that I made in a podcast

851
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,640
and was able to correlate the fact that

852
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,260
my grandkids call me robo Papa

853
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,940
here I said tell me about what Len did

854
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,419
last year

855
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,620
so it's gonna it went out and found all

856
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,779
the different things that I did in terms

857
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,140
of presentations during 2022.

858
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,779
if I had a larger data set

859
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,880
imagine what we could do with the same

860
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,039
type of Technology

861
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,120
so the in closing we're down to the

862
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,980
point where we have to ask

863
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,279
Ai and chat Bots identity business

864
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,340
identity home identity they're all the

865
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,179
same

866
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,179
there's no lines separating them anymore

867
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,159
so is this new technology that we're all

868
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,600
putting our faith in New Friend or Foe

869
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,159
because I just made it look like it

870
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,260
could be weaponized against us

871
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,779
honestly I guess that's what it depends

872
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,059
on who's asking the questions and what

873
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,340
controls they're currently in place to

874
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,559
keep those answers within a proper set

875
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,240
of parameters

876
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
I know there's been a ton of controversy

877
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,140
around the new this new technology and

878
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,000
everybody's got an opinion on it

879
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,919
everything from targeting individual and

880
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,080
threats of ruining personal users

881
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
careers to not providing correct answers

882
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,220
during live demonstrations for chat Bots

883
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,659
you know there's been conversations

884
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,960
about AI chatbot ethics morality bias as

885
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,580
well as any number of additional topics

886
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,440
and these are all things great

887
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,119
conversations that I can see happening

888
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
in the relatively near future

889
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,399
but the truth is we need to realize that

890
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,960
this is technology is still technically

891
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,719
in its infancy and we need to proceed

892
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,080
with caution because we don't know what

893
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,719
we don't know

894
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,119
so

895
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,820
we leave digital artifacts everywhere

896
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,280
and we need to realize the truth of the

897
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,379
matter these are all different types of

898
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,000
data that we're just leaving behind

899
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,500
and if we don't the problem is once it

900
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,080
hits the web it's there forever

901
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,179
so what do we do

902
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,699
we start looking at ourselves and

903
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,739
applying that same zero trust

904
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,839
methodology that we've all gotten so

905
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,300
used to in terms of our Digi

906
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,000
yeah I know I know

907
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,500
I got five minutes I know

908
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,720
that's okay I am the tsunami

909
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,260
so as I was saying we are the product

910
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,339
and we are our personal information

911
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,260
that we're using on things like Netflix

912
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,140
you know you saw the questions is your

913
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,660
the street you grew up on in Netflix the

914
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,160
same street you grew up on in o365.

915
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,740
you know so the call to action is

916
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,540
actually two-fold

917
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,180
just like back in the late 80s early 90s

918
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,640
when we had to learn not to click on

919
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,339
links in emails we need some behavioral

920
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:48,900
modification

921
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,119
you know when it comes to physical

922
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,460
identity security

923
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,160
access your home infrastructures update

924
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,500
your patch management realize that what

925
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,900
goes on in your corporate life is the

926
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,220
same type of things that would be going

927
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,240
on in your D your personal life

928
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,000
look at what's being asked

929
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,300
does this entity need this information

930
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,180
if you're going and to say an electronic

931
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,280
shop to buy a new computer do they need

932
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,660
to know where you live do they need to

933
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,000
know you know what your spending

934
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,640
patterns are you're buying this computer

935
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,800
if you're at a grocery store do they

936
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
need to know about Who Your Friends Are

937
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,599
everybody wants more

938
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,720
assess the situation and realize what

939
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,980
you're giving them

940
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,440
do they need it

941
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,599
slow down when it comes to social media

942
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,520
realize that a lot of these stupid tests

943
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,619
that'll give you your rock star name or

944
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,200
whatnot are actually personality quizzes

945
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,579
and they're meant to actually get

946
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,940
information for to map you out as a

947
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,780
person

948
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,700
they're trying to decrypt us as

949
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,619
individuals

950
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,420
look at the apps that you've loaded on

951
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,099
your mobile device I mean how many

952
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,020
people aside from me

953
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,960
actually look at the permissions that

954
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,940
are being asked before you install an

955
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,320
app

956
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,900
why would a notepad need access to your

957
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,660
contacts your camera and your microphone

958
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,339
think about it

959
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,760
as far as our digital call to action

960
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,079
adaptive multi-factor Authentication

961
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,000
Here I Am the tsunami

962
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,300
but look at adaptive multi-factor you

963
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,740
know take you can look at some of my

964
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,180
other talks there is not a single

965
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,920
biometric authentication that hasn't

966
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,040
been bypassed compromised or or spoofed

967
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,099
so all we really have is the ability to

968
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,700
lock it down with multi-factor

969
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,520
adaptively and for the love of God I

970
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,720
personally think two-factor

971
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,579
authentication should be considered a

972
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,200
profane word and we should never speak

973
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
it again

974
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,280
MFA does not mean two it means multiple

975
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,040
two is the minimum

976
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,720
username password

977
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,980
OTP

978
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,440
UT printed device

979
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,960
different protocols if you're online or

980
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,480
if you're off land is it coming from a

981
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,400
region that I know is safe if it's

982
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,380
coming in from China at 3 30 in the

983
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,540
morning it's probably not me

984
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,880
zero trust like I said everybody

985
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,500
understands zero trust from an

986
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,480
architectural model when it comes to

987
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
digital Solutions we need to apply those

988
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,099
same concepts of trust and verify to our

989
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,020
individual identities because the idea

990
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,640
that something that happens in my

991
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
personal life not

992
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,380
Following over into my work life

993
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,780
not a guarantee anymore especially when

994
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,060
we have so much work being done on

995
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,980
mobile devices if you're on a mobile

996
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,240
device and I compromise your mobile

997
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,099
device and you're on a VPN guess what I

998
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,599
can probably ride your VPN right into

999
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,980
your Enterprise

1000
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,339
verify your users verify your devices

1001
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,960
single sign-on

1002
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,859
we've seen how I can pull almost every

1003
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,819
single recovery question

1004
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,160
if we know that these particular answers

1005
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,079
are available through open source

1006
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:07,980
searches

1007
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,079
don't use those answers

1008
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,000
come up with something else

1009
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,740
if it's your mother's maiden name maybe

1010
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,740
spell it backwards do something that me

1011
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,660
as the attacker or the guy looking you

1012
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,280
up isn't going to be able to find and

1013
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,380
just stick right in

1014
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,240
think about it

1015
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,540
password managers also with single

1016
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,040
sign-on you will reduce the number of

1017
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,859
Self Service recovery portals that you

1018
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,260
will need the limit the number of times

1019
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,660
those particular passwords or answers to

1020
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,640
questions could be utilized

1021
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,380
IDs

1022
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,599
Next Generation firewalls privileged

1023
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,640
access management Network Taps and

1024
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,000
actually security security orchestration

1025
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
with that at the end of the day what

1026
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,339
does identity security mean we have one

1027
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,380
definition that everybody seems to

1028
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,060
understand when it comes to a digital

1029
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,160
perspective we need to make sure that

1030
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,500
they those same principles follow over

1031
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,780
into our normal physical lives because

1032
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,119
there is no line anymore

1033
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,400
so with that

1034
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,140
I would like to say open it up for a

1035
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,060
couple of quick q a and I thank you guys

1036
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,380
very much for attending my session

1037
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,359
[Applause]

1038
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,760
okay I are I hate to do this but I

1039
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,619
already promised she's got the first

1040
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,859
question

1041
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,300
as soon as she shuts off the Tsunami

1042
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,540
alert

1043
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
oh actually go ahead

1044
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,660
we'll let the mic whoever wants to ask

1045
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,820
the actual first question raise your

1046
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,740
hand and then our mic Runner will bring

1047
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,300
you the microphone anybody with a

1048
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,980
question raise your hand

1049
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,420
make sure that we speak into the mics

1050
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,060
because of the live stream on this so

1051
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,900
um

1052
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,820
kind of

1053
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,060
a funny first question so true

1054
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,119
um I watched your presentation on being

1055
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,400
a trans human just

1056
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,119
so as a person whose fiance and now

1057
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,800
husband was

1058
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,420
um subject to

1059
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,040
intense

1060
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,660
um

1061
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,740
uh uh

1062
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,660
um what's the word as searching by the

1063
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,480
TSA in the New Orleans airport oh yes

1064
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,540
for a Wrigley's chewing gum wrapper in

1065
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,160
his pocket

1066
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,260
uh I wondered how you get through the

1067
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,740
TSA or other that is the one question I

1068
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,480
get more than any other I will

1069
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,300
demonstrate how I walk through TSA ready

1070
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,160
I want you to see this because this is

1071
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,540
very complicated

1072
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,339
this is how I walk through TSA

1073
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,339
they've never found me

1074
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,320
number one there's not enough metal in

1075
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,700
my implants to actually trigger a

1076
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,140
magnetometer number two they're actually

1077
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,000
inside my body so if I'm in within the

1078
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
United States I have the law the HEPA

1079
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
laws that are protecting me and they're

1080
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,760
considered Medical

1081
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,200
so

1082
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,839
you realize when when in airports the

1083
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,520
magnetometers women can walk through

1084
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,320
with earrings and a necklace on they are

1085
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,720
not set that sensitive honestly most of

1086
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,980
the stuff that's in my implants is

1087
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,440
biomembranes and silicone the only metal

1088
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,079
is typically copper on The Wire antennas

1089
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,180
and the titanium and the iron in the

1090
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,680
magnet in my pinky

1091
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,480
so they they've never they've never

1092
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,220
caught me they've never asked and I've

1093
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,339
never been questioned

1094
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,759
any other questions

1095
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,520
about those people who are harvesting

1096
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,619
your data where do you see Microsoft in

1097
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,760
that list

1098
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,700
Believe It or Not Microsoft came in

1099
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,980
lower than Apple and the reason that

1100
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,079
apple and Microsoft came in so low on

1101
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,599
the data collection was because they are

1102
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,260
not as dependent on advertisements for

1103
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,260
Revenue they have actual product so

1104
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,599
typically Apple Microsoft are pretty

1105
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,180
much the same they keep enough data in

1106
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,400
order to maintain the account but they

1107
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,380
don't do a lot of overreach like your

1108
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,700
social media because they're actually

1109
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,839
gaining their revenue through

1110
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,859
advertising streams

1111
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:07,560
uh thank you very much yeah I love your

1112
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,200
presentation eye-opening but aren't we

1113
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,260
already all

1114
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,980
trapped

1115
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,160
aren't we already what and we all

1116
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,440
already trapped yeah I mean within the

1117
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,839
system yes in terms of what you shared

1118
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
in the latter part of your presentation

1119
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,800
yeah to do it's already out there and

1120
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,319
that's why I was saying if we know that

1121
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,000
these particular

1122
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,099
answers to these questions are out there

1123
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,200
these are still the standard questions

1124
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,240
for a lot of self-service recovery

1125
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,640
portals so if now that you know I can

1126
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,380
figure out your mother's maiden name or

1127
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,420
the street that you grew up on this is

1128
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,000
where we as enlightened Security

1129
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,980
Professionals go okay if they can let's

1130
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,500
say my mother's maiden name was Jones

1131
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,859
if that's the recovery question maybe I

1132
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,099
spelled Jones backwards maybe I

1133
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,020
put something in front of it like Mother

1134
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Jones you know don't this is where now

1135
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,400
that you understand that this type of

1136
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,579
information can be actually harvested

1137
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,079
modify those answers because a lot of

1138
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,040
times they're not going to let you

1139
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,960
create an account without those recovery

1140
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,980
questions

1141
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,560
so don't make the answer something that

1142
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,500
I can find through public information

1143
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,460
you know modify it you know and to be

1144
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,200
honest this is one of the reasons why I

1145
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,180
under our mitigation strategies this is

1146
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,800
where password managers that you can

1147
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,900
actually rotate the passwords on on a

1148
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,839
daily basis single sign-on lower the

1149
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,300
total number of

1150
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,460
actual recovery questions and portals

1151
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,280
that you need to utilize uh look at

1152
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,920
identity security products you know

1153
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,000
adaptive multi-factor uh possibly pki

1154
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,579
style certificates you know get away

1155
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,460
from what we're using and if you're

1156
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,380
forced to use it use it with the

1157
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,880
knowledge that these types of answers

1158
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,099
can be actually harvested and modify the

1159
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,900
answers so that you're the only one that

1160
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,520
actually knows what the answers are

1161
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,180
anyone else

1162
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,619
okay

1163
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:11,660
oh one more in the front all right

1164
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,579
yes okay so um I did

1165
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,640
a part of our ministry's work has also

1166
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,800
been to pass legislation in the Cayman

1167
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,460
Islands that is going to create an

1168
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,079
identification register and the

1169
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,440
possibility for a digital ID system that

1170
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,400
is

1171
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,880
um using the estonia's x-road system so

1172
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
I wondered if you would comment a little

1173
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,060
bit on

1174
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,859
govern the relationship of government

1175
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,400
and ID and how it just seems

1176
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,040
increasingly like

1177
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,780
all the information you've given is is

1178
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,900
our own ID and this Nexus between us and

1179
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,700
the Digital World

1180
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,619
um

1181
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:06,480
no system is going to be perfect no

1182
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,300
there isn't and and as much as I hate

1183
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,280
this I got to give some props to my one

1184
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,040
of my my companions that cyber Arc he

1185
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,200
actually gave me the greatest and worst

1186
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,700
explanation of a layered security

1187
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,819
concept that I've ever heard if every

1188
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,920
one of our security controls is one

1189
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,420
piece of Swiss cheese

1190
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,760
there's not a single security control

1191
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,859
out there that doesn't have some hole in

1192
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:29,880
it

1193
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,740
so if I put one slice of cheese up here

1194
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,880
I can get through

1195
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,500
well I put another slice of cheese up

1196
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,700
here the holes are there but they may

1197
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,920
not be in the same places and if you put

1198
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,420
enough controls in there there's no

1199
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,760
straight pass through anymore and that's

1200
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,619
honestly the unfortunately that's the

1201
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,140
answer is there is no one silver bullet

1202
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,819
and you need to look at things from an

1203
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,400
actual layered security approach

1204
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,060
so that you have that complete coverage

1205
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,079
identity security privileged access

1206
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,960
management Network taps with Sim

1207
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,720
integration uh data analytics against

1208
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,380
your Sims uh Security orchestrations

1209
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,000
based on if there's something detected

1210
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,420
in the Sim you know maybe it detects a

1211
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,880
logon of a privileged account

1212
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,980
domain administrator that during an

1213
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,400
irregular hour from an unknown Place

1214
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,180
automatically through security

1215
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,700
orchestration take that particular host

1216
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,500
move it into a different non-author

1217
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,020
interactive OU and prep it for digital

1218
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,599
forensics and incident response you know

1219
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,000
we're never going to be in front of the

1220
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,220
eight ball you know I I was asked a

1221
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,200
question and I'll close with this you

1222
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,720
know is a threat really a threat if it

1223
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,780
hasn't made it into the wild yet and I I

1224
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,200
think the answer is it's individuals

1225
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,440
determination of their own risk as to

1226
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,660
where you go with this but as long as

1227
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,819
you have enough controls you will

1228
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,460
security is a state of mind it is not a

1229
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,800
state of being you know for you to

1230
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,740
actually say I am safe I feel bad for

1231
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,200
you if you say I have put enough

1232
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,619
controls and security measures in front

1233
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,560
of my systems that if somebody gets

1234
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,960
through my dwell time will be minimal

1235
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,160
I'm more about detection and mitigation

1236
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,660
those are the people that I think are

1237
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,359
going to do well because every single

1238
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,000
day there's new zero days found and as

1239
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,500
much as we're trying to secure things

1240
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,119
there are other individuals out there

1241
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,099
that are trying to tear it apart and

1242
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,800
they have a much greater desire than we

1243
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,640
do just based on the financial gain

1244
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,160
any other questions

1245
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,839
thank you guys so very much I know it

1246
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,579
was early I hope you enjoyed it I will

1247
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:39,780
be available out in the back if you're

1248
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,520
one of those types like I was used to be

1249
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,540
where you're like I don't want to ask a

1250
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,819
question in front of a bunch of people

1251
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,440
um hit me up I'm a really approachable

1252
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,780
guy and thank you guys very much for

1253
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,040
taking the time to come and listen to My

1254
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,660
Big Mouth this morning

1255
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,160
enjoy the rest of the conference
