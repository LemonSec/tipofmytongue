1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,540
oh

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,339
hi good morning well so everyone can

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,779
hear me

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,059
uh like she said I'm will Baggett I'm

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,500
here to discuss

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,360
uh the

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,099
first time actually speaking live in a

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,160
while so here we go

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,960
first before we get too deep into this

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,420
is anyone working digital forensics show

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,279
hands one

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,359
okay

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,640
we'll keep it introductory level then

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,500
we'll bag it uh used to work for the

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,320
government I did human collection cyber

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,640
collection

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
uh director of digital forensics and

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,100
advanced technology use for Operation

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,980
Safe Escape we provide the domesticated

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,520
domestic abuse victims a means to sever

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
digital ties with their abusers

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,360
sometimes it could be as simple as

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,760
turning uh switch up on the iPhone where

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,379
you're sharing your iMessages for my

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,020
being located or returning your

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,840
Siri off on your iPhone or even and I

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,219
don't need to start this beach I really

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,199
like this topic I can go pretty deep

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,659
into it but uh just showing how simple

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,280
it is to turn things off so you're not

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,720
stocked and hacked we do a lot of

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
forensic work with that

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,260
I'm a cyber threat intelligence manager

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,299
at a very well-known place if I'd

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,560
mentioned who I was I'd have to get

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,420
corporate concurrence legal and all that

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,220
and take several years so we're not

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,540
going to mention it

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,000
one bit of corporate advice is if you do

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
work digital forensics it's necessary

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,200
for your mental health to rotate out do

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,759
something different because of what you

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,740
see whether it's fraud theft crime

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,439
murder abuse terrorism

45
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,060
it's not healthy to see that every day

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,799
so right now I'm doing cyber threat

47
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,280
intelligence

48
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,820
there is an American sports coach

49
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,979
and Nick Saban and he says he won't

50
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,020
discuss politics because half of his fan

51
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,640
base is going to disagree with him so he

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,020
stays very neutral

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,360
when it comes to discussing U.S voting

54
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,399
laws elections and voting machines I'm

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,780
taking the very same approach here

56
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,680
because you need an impartial Observer

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,479
down here I realize football is football

58
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,360
not soccer as we call it back in the U.S

59
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,758
we can all probably spend an hour two

60
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,919
hours three hours day two days

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,080
discussing how a blown call by

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,360
biased referee cost our team a spot in

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
the playoffs whether it's NCAA football

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,739
whether it's World Cup whether it's

65
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,940
hockey

66
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,340
we've all seen that so we've got to be

67
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,080
accurate so in digital forensics when

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,660
we're examining voting machines we also

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,239
want to be impartial report what we see

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
report what we don't see

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,680
and

72
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,140
the reason why we didn't know this we're

73
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
working at Defcon and when they say

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,379
voting Village

75
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,420
it's not you know collection of houses

76
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,519
and Roads you know they're not throwing

77
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,260
flowers out there there's not chickens

78
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,239
it's a freaking conference room in a

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,040
hotel suite

80
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,900
so you've got just a suite of random

81
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,760
machines that have been purchased

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,400
people come in they look at them

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,220
they start doing forensics they see them

84
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,720
it is

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
anyway the conference report as I start

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
to examine this

87
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,140
2.5 billion people read the forensic

88
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,760
write-up and Analysis of what we did

89
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,519
after 2019.

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,260
there was a lot of discussion but there

91
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,000
wasn't discussion about we handled it

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
improperly that's a bit of a point of

93
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,739
pride

94
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
and this hits home we thought that one

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,440
juror resilient ticket for an incident

96
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,040
of one possible intrusion by quackbot or

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,080
a ransomware gang got 87 views on the

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,300
corporate blog and the manager is happy

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,599
2.5 billion people read this

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,420
and didn't find fault so that's not bad

101
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,640
we need to have impartiality so enough

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,599
of the legalese

103
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,780
did I skip a step here

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,640
believe I did

105
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,200
I just killed it there we go

106
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,580
more legally sorry

107
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,220
so these voting machines we go through a

108
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,500
process where Harry Hearst he's from

109
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,239
Norway

110
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,459
he's working with the US government also

111
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,060
working for voting Integrity groups

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,159
he'll buy the machines on secondary

113
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,560
markets uh government auctions in the

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,780
U.S you'll buy them from eBay

115
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,220
there's one that he purchased for want

116
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,660
to talk later on about the voting

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,940
machine prototype from China

118
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,300
which seems absolutely bizarre but there

119
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,759
is a presidential candidate's family who

120
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,220
want to help get more accurate voting

121
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,600
results

122
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,300
so they put their name on the voting

123
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,240
machine Hari actually managed to get the

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
device we've looked at that at Defcon

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,820
that's what the bulk of this talk is

126
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,840
about

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,699
none of the devices are procured

128
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,340
illicitly if we did find something that

129
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,840
was

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,300
improper and want to go forth with it

131
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,940
but it had been stolen misleaded however

132
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,740
is legal term to Fruit of the poison

133
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,259
tree we couldn't do anything with it

134
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,040
now theoretically speaking

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,620
magic right theoretically speaking

136
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,139
say you find the voting machines in use

137
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,639
at Defcon at the uh the loading dock

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,139
and you decide to prove that your

139
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,419
candidate was robbed of the election and

140
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,580
you steal the voting machine

141
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,240
in Vegas

142
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,699
you know where you've got security

143
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,139
cameras

144
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,960
every few feet walking your step from

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
the front door

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,919
to the loading dock carrying this box

147
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,960
out and then a few minutes later you

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,820
show up on the news of oh I found proof

149
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,699
that this election was stolen

150
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,500
there's all the facial recognitions

151
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,240
you've not proven your case was

152
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,960
fraudulent you've actually just

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,220
committed a failing now you're going to

154
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,660
jail the FBI is not interested in you

155
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,800
for uh

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
being the national hero you've just

157
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,020
committed a pretty stupid crime

158
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,699
not that that happened that didn't

159
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,979
happen in 2022 in August didn't happen

160
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,400
at all

161
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
theoretically speaking so everything

162
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,360
we've done is above board machines you

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,740
can actually buy them on eBay if you

164
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,860
want to but why would you want to

165
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,419
touch on that in a second do these

166
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,719
things are

167
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,259
say old it's just we'll see

168
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,139
so 2017 I left the government I'm doing

169
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,539
independent Consulting I'm in Las Vegas

170
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,660
for digital recovery e-discovery case I

171
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,720
have my full toolkit with me

172
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
and

173
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,940
it's uh blacklight digital forensics kit

174
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,660
for iOS iPhone

175
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,340
you can't do some windows I have magnet

176
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,440
Axiom I have a probably about fifteen

177
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
twenty thousand dollars of gear on me

178
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,380
you don't leave it in your hotel room

179
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,060
even here at the conference I've got my

180
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,100
presentation laptop here because it's my

181
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,080
freaking laptop I don't want to lose it

182
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,180
same thing in Vegas where

183
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,880
crime is rampant so I keep it with me

184
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,340
I was walking past the room I saw okay

185
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,199
here's these voting machines I've got my

186
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,600
kit of course it's always the last day

187
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,039
of the conference I walked up to Hari

188
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,639
and said I have this equipment not many

189
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,979
other people at Vegas Defcon had it out

190
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,919
of thirty thousand attendees

191
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,419
he had a machine that hadn't been

192
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,940
touched by other people which is key for

193
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,100
the forensic process and I sit down and

194
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,600
started examining it

195
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,780
things got really familiar

196
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,479
the machine he gave me it was about

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,819
I want to say 128

198
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,919
Meg of a hard drive

199
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,780
it had been put in service in 2000 2001

200
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,620
is running unpatched Windows XP

201
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,160
the voting software itself was a 1997

202
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,560
Microsoft access database

203
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,660
hard drive is unencrypted

204
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,720
USB ports no security on those

205
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,460
whatsoever

206
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,699
so this is in 2017 this machine could

207
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,099
drive

208
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,240
it could be in high school be a senior

209
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,919
this is an old machine that's never been

210
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,900
touched

211
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,900
that's good and that's bad

212
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,220
it's never been connected to the

213
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,539
internet it's only been used for one

214
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,460
purpose

215
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,819
is that unsecure I don't know

216
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,680
start looking and the first thing I did

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,780
was go to the log so

218
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,520
ah they tell me this machine's never

219
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,020
connected to the internet but there's an

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,199
FTP log you can see there WS underscore

221
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,539
FTP log

222
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,360
so I pull strings

223
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,940
and I can see that the files have been

224
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,159
sent them

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
access database files have been

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,260
transmitted to FTP infocom.com

227
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,000
that's interesting for a machine that

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,020
never connects to the internet

229
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,580
where are these files going

230
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,019
so like a bad episode of American

231
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,260
reality TV I phoned a friend

232
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,480
uh one of my he's no longer there now

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,519
but he worked at CNN as a researcher

234
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,920
we looked up infocom or heated bandwidth

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,300
there is terrible because they don't

236
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,100
want you on your phones in Vegas they

237
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,440
want you downstairs playing

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,420
slot machines so they want you gambling

239
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,560
they want you drinking and partying

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,060
spending money not just sitting in your

241
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,779
room

242
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,000
scrolling on Tick Tock or whatever so

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,339
cell service is terrible my friend sends

244
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,140
me this back

245
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,860
infocoms of company based out of Canada

246
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,459
here's their IP address

247
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,420
here's all about them but they don't

248
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,680
mention they have anything to do with

249
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,540
the voting system this is pretty

250
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,279
interesting

251
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,279
I get Hari the manager the leader of the

252
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,899
voting Village the room supervisor

253
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,360
and this ends up going in the

254
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
Congressional report on the conference

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,980
ends up going in uh New York Post so

256
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,140
there I am going just working with an

257
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,060
entertainment company they didn't pay me

258
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,100
I'm not bitter about that working for an

259
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,839
entertainment company

260
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,459
to being interviewed by the New York

261
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,019
Post for digital forensics I wasn't

262
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,720
expecting that

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
so the next year

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
we realized okay this got a lot of

265
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,620
attention this could go badly

266
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,560
if we don't do this right

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,540
we actually put a process in I don't

268
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,100
like process even though I've had a

269
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
career in government I don't like

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
process all that I'm more of

271
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
not a government employee really so

272
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,580
we worked out a

273
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,279
workflow terrible grammar I'm sorry

274
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,500
we had examined the machines before the

275
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,899
general public would come in

276
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,060
they brought inscribes to document this

277
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,860
from Georgetown law undergraduate

278
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,839
students looking to work in government

279
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,260
policy space we had very formal handling

280
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
procedures on the machines

281
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,920
I'll show you why in a minute now you've

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,660
seen this part of it on the news the

283
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,220
other part of what we did with the

284
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,320
infocom log

285
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,760
that wasn't on the news

286
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,860
our process just like any other digital

287
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,079
forensic process collection examination

288
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,540
analysis and Reporting and from that we

289
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,000
pivot back to see here's what we found

290
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,920
what did we miss on the other machines

291
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,040
uh Carson Schumer he's a name dropping

292
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,959
to give him recognition a university

293
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,420
Professor from Copenhagen was here he

294
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,540
found that on the raw base image of the

295
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,060
wind vote machines there is an mp3 from

296
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,440
China for the voting machines were

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,820
manufactured

298
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,040
he recovered the MP3 of that Chinese

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,839
machine we didn't find it anywhere else

300
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,180
in the other machines but one but we now

301
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,740
had to Pivot to say okay this is an

302
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,079
anomaly is it been replicated the

303
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,019
machines were from

304
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,220
dozens of states that wasn't just one

305
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,200
machine out of one Precinct

306
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,980
and we'll you know see this but um

307
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,959
the principle the perpetrator will bring

308
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,519
something into a crime scene and leave

309
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,980
with something from It generally

310
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,399
so there was and I feel

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
it's part of this but I feel ridiculous

312
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,579
saying it

313
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,160
there was a conspiracy going around that

314
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
there was a satellite controlled by the

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,839
Italians that had

316
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,839
read write access to voting machines and

317
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,579
that's how they were changing votes

318
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:06,779
y'all

319
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,680
there is no chip in a Windows XP from

320
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,180
2000.

321
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
that has satellite comms with the

322
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,540
Italians that's just not even freaking

323
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,519
possible that

324
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,560
but people get spun up and believe this

325
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,120
so you would actually see where the

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
software was installed you'd see the

327
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,360
physical chip the conspiracy theories

328
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,640
fall apart it's an old Windows machine

329
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
so if someone comes in to upload

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,560
software you're going to have the date

331
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
time stamp of when the USB drive was

332
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
inserted you're going to have the virus

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,360
or the virus the software malware

334
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,040
spyware ransomware whatever you want to

335
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,940
call it you're going to see where that's

336
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,440
applied that's not there

337
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,860
even on the Apple iOS I had every file

338
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,480
on the fort Cree is numbered so you can

339
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,100
see if you know file number here here

340
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,720
this one's missing there's that well

341
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,399
what's missing your software you can

342
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,920
undelete files or you can find was this

343
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,560
file missing

344
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,800
first pillar of forensic processing

345
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
you don't change the evidence to be

346
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,139
blunt that

347
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,540
the whole justice system falls apart if

348
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
the law enforcement agency can change

349
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,019
the evidence to make it read what they

350
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,860
need to for their case

351
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,300
also going back you don't

352
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,579
upload pictures of riftcastley and have

353
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,980
uh the Rickroll video

354
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,899
and claim that was only that's easy to

355
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,839
show so people would do that

356
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,779
if you have to examine this device you

357
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,040
have to be competent either through

358
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,260
experience through training whether it's

359
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,700
through a Sans training course whether

360
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,339
it's through vendor training course

361
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,260
corporate training there has to be some

362
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,120
modicum of training on this and you have

363
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,160
to stay current before the pandemic

364
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,959
we called it dead box forensics you

365
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,760
would get a USB drive in the mail you

366
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,260
would get a hard drive in the mail or

367
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,600
you'd fly out I missed that you'd fly

368
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,940
out to go image the device on site to

369
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,279
see all the uh Hardware software issues

370
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,740
were and fly back to your lab to go look

371
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,540
at the evidence

372
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,220
now with modern software you can

373
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,480
actually have endpoint whether it's

374
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,820
crowdstrike or druva remotely access the

375
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,200
machine pull the registry and look to

376
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,300
see what's changed but you have to know

377
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,320
what you're doing to be trained well

378
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,100
with this otherwise it's just code

379
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,959
there needs to be an audit trail of what

380
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,339
so happened

381
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,639
so when you image this device I validate

382
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,980
the hash everything is

383
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,740
copacetic

384
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,420
you need to be able to say if you're on

385
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,860
the prosecution team the defense should

386
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,120
be able to replicate the evidence you

387
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,680
have there to prove that yes this came

388
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
down a good example going back to

389
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,639
Operation Safe Escape is whether it's

390
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,920
Google takeout or whether it's Apple's

391
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
data recovery for you have all your

392
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,639
iMessages or all your Google data

393
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,260
literally Google takeout keeps

394
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,820
everything

395
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,620
as much as I hate that from a

396
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,199
Libertarian privacy point of view that's

397
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,360
fantastic because it shows you know my

398
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
client received these harassing text

399
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
messages from this number

400
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,579
that can be downloaded from Google

401
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,860
that's an authoritative source

402
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,260
as opposed to yeah here's a printout of

403
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,940
a screenshot that can easily be

404
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,399
photoshopped and manipulated that's a

405
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,720
big thing on Twitter to have funny

406
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
exchanges or reddit's anti-work or know

407
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
your boss of all the things that never

408
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
happened this never happened the most

409
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,600
but pulling the chat logs down from

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,260
Apple Google

411
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,820
and having opposition look at it or the

412
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,899
work we're doing at the voting Village

413
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,000
to see where everything matches up it's

414
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,320
authentic that's the goal we need

415
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,880
lastly the person in charge of the

416
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,740
investigation whether it's Hari Hearst

417
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,079
overlooking the entire voting Village or

418
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,240
whether it was me running the forensic

419
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,199
effort

420
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,420
we have responsibility to make sure that

421
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,040
okay this device we're going to image

422
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,620
has just been returned by this group of

423
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,500
attendees who are examining well that's

424
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,199
not following proper handling procedures

425
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,880
they can have it they can look at it

426
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
what we need it for

427
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,639
is no longer valid

428
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,279
because we would arrive at Defcon early

429
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,699
before the crowds enter the Boating

430
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,839
Village

431
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,959
we would image the device

432
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,320
I would damage it make a copy

433
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
another person image it make a copy

434
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
would validate the hash codes to make

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
sure that these are accurate the hash

436
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,260
codes

437
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,139
y'all familiar with hash codes yes no

438
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,019
maybe I don't know

439
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,019
it's a digital signature of the file and

440
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,240
it's fairly Impossible on higher level

441
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,860
hashes to have identical it's like

442
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,660
having identical grains of sand from the

443
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,160
beach it's just not going to happen as

444
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,899
long as these are identical

445
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,579
the copy I'm working with you're working

446
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,899
with and you're working with are all the

447
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,139
same results should be similar

448
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,839
we only work on copies of the backup so

449
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,339
if we did find something that was truly

450
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,800
damning The Originals off to the side

451
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,540
another backup is here work if you're

452
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,220
not third and fourth versions of the

453
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,079
copies just in case because you never

454
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,839
know what you're going to find

455
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,940
so the processing again this is vendor

456
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,100
agnostic because as the military says

457
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,980
two is one one is none I've had cases

458
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,380
where I'd image the hard drive the phone

459
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,020
with black light and then image it with

460
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,959
Axiom and then paraben

461
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,740
and then run a 79 tool just on Lark from

462
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
the Apple store and find recovered text

463
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,339
messages that the big programs can

464
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,079
recover

465
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,760
so unless you've given it a better

466
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,900
picture you don't know what evidence

467
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,400
you're missing if you're only using one

468
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,380
tool the better vendors will tell you

469
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,000
validate our results with another tool

470
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,700
large corporations would say we have one

471
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,080
tool that's all we're paying for that's

472
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,039
the one you don't want to work for

473
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,360
because if you can't validate the

474
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,220
accuracy of your work you don't need to

475
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,840
sign that document legally to say I put

476
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,940
my name my reputation online saying this

477
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,220
is accurate if I can't validate it

478
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,500
we would do three things we'd write to

479
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,140
DMG file on a Mac if this was what I was

480
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,179
teaching uh cyber

481
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,880
issues to NATO's facial forces

482
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,440
we would stop here we'd actually go

483
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,880
through the steps on how to create a dng

484
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,240
file in a Mac a virtual hard drive in

485
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,460
Windows of course copying the external

486
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,720
media that

487
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,100
I think that's probably going away now

488
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,299
it seems like external media is

489
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,320
Vanishing

490
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
but we would do this that way we can

491
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
copy

492
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,260
the containers to the media and then

493
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,480
have it shared easily whether you're in

494
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
the war zone sharing the files or just

495
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
sharing the Defcon it's a good standard

496
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,179
practice everything is made in a

497
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,740
read-only format

498
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,880
we use these tools autopsy blacklight

499
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,240
and magnet axing for data analysis

500
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,100
we'd use black lights and acquisition

501
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,620
ftk imager to acquire the files to image

502
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,960
it in redripper to go through the

503
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,340
registry to see the last files open

504
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,440
what's been loaded that we didn't we're

505
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,980
unaware of in disk drill was a fairly

506
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,660
inexpensive program it does file on

507
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,120
deletions it's recovered better data

508
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,140
than

509
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,220
a lot of the five figure programs

510
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,020
so here you can see we're actually using

511
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,760
black light before they're purchased by

512
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,700
celebrite and they went for 700 a year

513
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,500
of a license to thirty thousand dollars

514
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,940
it's not worth it

515
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,200
I don't think y'all are watching but

516
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,799
it's not worth it

517
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
so we would copy it

518
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,820
and this is why we had the hard

519
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,559
standards and controls this is what you

520
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,860
see on the news CNN Fox news CNBC BBC

521
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,299
whatever

522
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,860
oh wow they hacked no you didn't

523
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,200
freaking hack it you copied Rick Astley

524
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,760
from your thumb drive and put it on a

525
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
machine that's not hacking it's Ctrl C

526
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,000
that's control V that's more thread into

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,860
I shouldn't say that either

528
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,120
that's

529
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,840
why we have standards and controls

530
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,720
after we damage it this is what disc

531
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,340
drill looks like it shows all the

532
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,900
deleted files we look and see if there's

533
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,460
anything unique in there

534
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,160
one of the common things now from

535
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,900
nist.gov is they have salt files you can

536
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,640
go through they've collected all the

537
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,440
common files for the operating systems

538
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
the hash values so you can remove the

539
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,419
known good files and only look at the

540
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,900
anomalies

541
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,940
and this is also why we have to do it

542
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,980
properly this is the end result that

543
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,720
they didn't look at how the sausages

544
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,039
being made they didn't look at the

545
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
forensic evidence they didn't look at

546
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,580
the proper handling we see there's all

547
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,020
the Glorious computer science we were

548
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,640
doing

549
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,980
they went for the meme which okay

550
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,280
whatever

551
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,539
a friend sent me a screenshot that we

552
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,299
actually made the last

553
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,260
Defcon before covid hit

554
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,840
we actually ended up there

555
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
this is why we have hard rules

556
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,520
going through this a little bit you can

557
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,140
see we actually have to crack the hard

558
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,940
drive apart these are not machines I

559
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,679
mentioned earlier theoretically that if

560
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,760
you're going to take one and walk

561
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,320
through a casino

562
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,940
you're not smuggling this in your

563
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,559
backpack that's a huge machine

564
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,580
also Imaging takes a while so I think

565
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,400
two iced coffees and a Mountain Dew

566
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,340
Express with extra caffeine to try stay

567
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,799
awake through the process

568
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,780
this looks like it came out of the set

569
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,299
of Mandalorian or 1977 Star Wars on a

570
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,340
sandcrawler

571
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,500
buddies this is still in Houston Iowa by

572
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
the way it has a 10 horsepower motor

573
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,360
to pull the paper

574
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
why you need that much horsepower to

575
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
pull sheets of paper for not making

576
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
experiment I don't know but that's what

577
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,799
they've got you have a waterproof port

578
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,539
for dhcd programming why I don't know

579
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,580
the entire hard drive is written in a

580
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,020
the operating system is written a

581
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,539
variant of a Blackberry operating system

582
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,760
all clear text

583
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,520
so again once you actually found the

584
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,559
adapter to go zip disk to something you

585
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,900
could actually read

586
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,360
wasn't too bad but finding these

587
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,860
esoteric Parts you feel like you're

588
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,639
going back in time

589
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,940
most of them rely on compact flash cards

590
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,440
the one boat machines you've heard about

591
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,659
a lot on the news

592
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,700
the data is written here

593
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,679
so this is it this is what people say

594
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,600
has been hacked it's a flash card

595
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,159
when's the last time

596
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,140
are maybe all still using compact flash

597
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,000
cards

598
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,600
no

599
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,940
and Beyond compact flash cards they were

600
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,559
just flash cards which are different if

601
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,000
you put a compact flash card in a

602
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,919
flashcard reader you're going to destroy

603
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,080
the reader Source trust me

604
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,460
there used to be a large electronic

605
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,960
store in Vegas fries before Amazon

606
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,200
killed it we'd have a shuttle going from

607
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,179
Defcon to fries to pick up the parts we

608
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,340
need for these ancient machines

609
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,700
so this is another windows

610
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,520
XP NT system running on a compact flash

611
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,658
card that we would image

612
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,780
put in your school sticker on a laptop

613
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,940
on a voting machine is also not hacking

614
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,559
by the way it's

615
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,480
vandalism especially for a South

616
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,039
Carolina sticker

617
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,740
things that we found after we imaged the

618
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,480
machine username and password because of

619
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,860
Sunshine Law in the United States those

620
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,080
were available online the admin name and

621
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,520
password for the machines those are

622
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,260
available online

623
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,020
this is compliance with state law

624
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,539
don't think I agree with that one

625
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,659
so the altered files

626
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,880
after we image that device with a little

627
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,740
honey bear and the big cry and the

628
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,580
Defcon logo

629
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,539
still ran

630
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,400
again

631
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,500
hard to break the old habit of being an

632
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,919
instructor

633
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,360
if we had laptops in front of you I'd

634
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,940
say pick a state pick a country

635
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,559
find the voting machine used in the

636
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,640
state

637
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,740
look at the username password for the

638
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,240
machine is that hacking or is that just

639
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,720
o sounds

640
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,220
so this bad boy

641
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,140
the premier voting machine

642
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,760
after we image it we turned it on we

643
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,780
actually want to see what we're working

644
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,640
with the two Google searches we found

645
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,260
the username password the security name

646
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,679
and password

647
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm not

648
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,780
notable of memorizing

649
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,120
hash value for every single file and

650
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
machine

651
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,020
that I wouldn't be here I wouldn't be in

652
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,460
Vegas I'd be on Wall Street actually I'd

653
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,780
probably own the island that would be

654
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,400
something phenomenal be able to memorize

655
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,220
things like that and track trends

656
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,559
the premier voting machine

657
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,000
prints

658
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,659
56 pages of hash values for every you

659
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,960
can't download it it prints

660
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,940
how you're going to validate there's no

661
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,000
virus there's no malware

662
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
so we ran experiments we got the Scribe

663
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,740
over from Georgetown we validated what

664
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,480
we were going to do

665
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,620
okay

666
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,939
we copied the logon user ID the file

667
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,799
change it to my friend's avatar from his

668
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
website

669
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,980
it loads

670
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,480
you get a warning that something has

671
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,340
changed so there is a hash validation of

672
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,840
the file there is some camper detection

673
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,720
we were surprised to see that

674
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,820
this is what made CNN this is what made

675
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,678
Fox News it's not that hard work okay

676
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,400
the Chinese voting machine this came up

677
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,140
because of code I don't know if y'all

678
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,299
have heard but there's a virus from 2021

679
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,159
to like the end of time that stopped a

680
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,140
lot of things

681
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,059
so the first true voting machine Village

682
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,600
we had was in 2022 last year after the

683
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,779
pause

684
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,760
the voting machine itself we'll talk

685
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,039
about this seven thousand dollars it's

686
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,900
150 pounds

687
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,580
you think about the poll workers who set

688
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,799
up the voting machines they're usually

689
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,620
elderly retired

690
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,059
maneuvering a 150 pound Behemoth for one

691
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,520
machine is tough doing that to set up an

692
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,220
entire room good luck with that

693
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,620
so this is the Prototype that a

694
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,419
political family

695
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,500
is endorsing

696
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,240
we actually found the specs online

697
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,980
we're concerned about data security and

698
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,159
people hacking into it so this one has

699
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,039
a camera so they can watch you as you

700
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,320
print for facial recognition

701
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,240
it scans your driver's license your ID

702
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,580
card to make sure it's truly you a

703
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,020
fingerprint reader

704
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,720
has Bluetooth 4G and Wi-Fi and speakers

705
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,760
why I don't

706
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,980
I'm not voting to listen to music I'm

707
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,480
not listening to Jimmy Buffett and

708
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,460
Island band I just want to freaking vote

709
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,360
and go home

710
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,880
I believe the phrases insecure possibly

711
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,659
so you actually have the machine here

712
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,559
from their website

713
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,880
it is the idea of having facial

714
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,799
recognition fingerprint capture and your

715
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,360
ID captured when you vote does that make

716
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,340
anyone feel warm and fuzzy does that

717
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,100
seem and have Bluetooth

718
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,679
and cell service connection to it

719
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,419
so as much as I don't like having a

720
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,400
Windows XP box that I might be voting on

721
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,080
it's still a little bit better than

722
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,400
knowing this device is on I don't know

723
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,020
who's accessing it while voting is

724
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,320
occurring

725
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,480
foreign

726
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,620
so where do you get the device manual

727
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,158
from for this

728
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,940
to the chat Channel Through Alibaba the

729
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,400
manufacturer no your Precinct voted this

730
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,620
machine they would send you a PDF

731
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,600
ready to get your software updates

732
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,760
direct custom patches and updates for

733
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,740
you there's no open source validation

734
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,240
from the community there's no

735
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,039
examination it's just

736
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,720
here's a file just for you no one else

737
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,980
can look at it

738
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,460
from China one of our adversaries

739
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,220
this doesn't seem like a positive step I

740
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,960
don't know I've only been doing cyber

741
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,700
security for a few years

742
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,760
so we actually got the device we had to

743
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
discuss with the unions we had to get

744
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,779
several people a hand truck

745
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,059
this is the device as it arrives

746
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,620
in the voting machine Village you can

747
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,320
see this thing is not small 150 pounds

748
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,880
it arrived we got it cleared because

749
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,799
we're not allowed to actually move the

750
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,059
material because of rules and

751
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,140
regulations

752
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,240
we get it

753
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,400
and that night we have to leave the room

754
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,260
again rules and regulations Fire Marshal

755
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,120
code so we had to leave it so we wanted

756
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,679
to do something called trapping anyone

757
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,600
familiar with that term it's not a

758
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,419
it's like a Honeypot token

759
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,240
I took video of this

760
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,080
can't pause it

761
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,340
can you play the video please

762
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,699
thank you

763
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,179
we took note of all the unique locations

764
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,580
where

765
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,100
things come together on the video

766
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,380
where tape for the metal tape comes

767
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,559
together

768
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,840
I took note of it we didn't advertise it

769
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,179
we didn't discuss it

770
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,940
we noted for the hinges were that way if

771
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,679
the machine had been opened overnight

772
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,080
and broke the seal literally the seal

773
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,940
the chain of custody we would know the

774
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,899
machine had been altered overnight

775
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,100
during a

776
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,220
before we could come back into the room

777
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,100
we use a high speed load drag tool to

778
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,580
open the box

779
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,260
and then we get this thing

780
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,059
first thing we did because it is Defcon

781
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,399
we don't have 100 chain of custody 100

782
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,440
control of our environment

783
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,299
we removed the power cord we want to

784
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,559
make sure this machine is accurate it's

785
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,240
a seven thousand dollar machine it's a

786
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,080
beast

787
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,779
came from China China

788
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,640
so remove the power cord cover that with

789
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,899
a sticker so someone couldn't just plug

790
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:50,399
it in to see what it does thereby and

791
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,299
doubting the results

792
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,039
most of the machine actually sits on a

793
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
repository for the paper ballots are

794
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,539
printed and stored

795
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,159
so if you've ever submitted a corporate

796
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,140
expense receipt report

797
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,880
and the thermal printer you know how

798
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,200
great those are after about a week

799
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,700
they're blank they're white right you

800
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,960
can't read them you can't use them you

801
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,799
have to go back to the vendor get

802
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,659
another one to try to get reimbursed

803
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,399
that's why all the votes were printed on

804
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,719
is thermal paper

805
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,900
we open the box up

806
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,640
[Music]

807
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,419
and I'm sorry

808
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,340
okay I should play this again there are

809
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,440
two printer rolls that the printer rules

810
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,520
run out of paper The Machine's

811
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,418
completely offline

812
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,860
and of course someone wants to help by

813
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,240
unplugging everything before we can

814
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,039
document it that that's not helping

815
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,779
that's making it worse that's making it

816
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:49,980
much worse

817
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,840
so you can see this is not a standard

818
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,220
machine this isn't your traditional

819
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,179
computer that you're getting

820
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,600
we saw that okay

821
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,700
this could be a problem

822
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,559
we're also the group of us were

823
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
experienced in I don't want to say

824
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,140
mature I don't like that word but

825
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,720
experienced enough to know there's

826
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,520
examining and tinkering we went further

827
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,179
we would tinker

828
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
one person had fantastic idea he took a

829
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,580
photo of the unknown circuit board

830
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,260
ran it through Google image searches

831
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,720
Yandex and tenai to see if there's any

832
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,980
other circuit board like we found

833
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,620
identical ones as an Android board

834
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,919
and we checked there were no visible

835
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,140
anomalies on the board it looked like

836
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,000
this should be what the circuit board

837
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,440
should be there's nothing special there

838
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,140
in the same conference hall there's the

839
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,539
internet of things where they do drones

840
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,700
the different sensors the Alexa's all

841
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,860
that good stuff

842
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,440
I walked over and said we have this

843
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,299
we don't have the equipment to image it

844
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,419
can you help of course they

845
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,460
love the chance they did a chip off

846
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,320
extraction mean they put leads on the

847
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,940
circuit board

848
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,000
cloned the device

849
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,279
it was slow took overnight we actually

850
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,100
had to hide the machine

851
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,320
keep it from being touched while this

852
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,360
Imaging occurred overnight 128 101

853
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
123.8 gigabyte file it doesn't seem like

854
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,000
that big until you're sending to someone

855
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,720
that's massive

856
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,260
again going back to instructor mode I

857
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,940
brought my right blocker toolkit with me

858
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,380
in the yellow Pelican case

859
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,600
and I realized the entire case relied on

860
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,059
the USB 30 type A to type B cable

861
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,640
without that one specific cable

862
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,200
everything else out there didn't work

863
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
and when TSA was inspecting my luggage

864
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
that cable got crushed they were able to

865
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,700
rehabilitate the internet of things but

866
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,700
Point here maybe not so much for voting

867
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,380
machines about forensics in general if

868
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,059
you have limited access to a targeted

869
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,799
device plan for the worst assume it's

870
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,720
going to fail the sooner you're going to

871
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,620
need to use your backup

872
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,500
so again

873
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,059
I would say your tax dollars from out of

874
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,679
the country your tax dollars taught me

875
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,960
this your primary image alternate image

876
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,399
so if the one image 123.8 file fails we

877
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,320
have a backup not only do I have a

878
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,220
backup

879
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,500
I gave a copy to Hari a copy to someone

880
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,179
else to mind playing hate to say it went

881
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,640
down I wasn't single threaded I didn't

882
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,140
have the only copy two other people on

883
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,059
two different planes had it just in case

884
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,140
because we didn't know what we were

885
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,120
working with

886
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,220
the media is unreliable

887
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,039
the higher the case sensitivity the more

888
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,419
high level attention you have the

889
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,760
greater the chance it's going to die

890
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,260
and of course my mandatory Star Wars

891
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,460
quote would you like to know the odds of

892
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,200
failure they're high very high

893
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,000
so we finally get the image

894
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,919
we don't know what we have first thing I

895
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,740
do is connect it through a write blocker

896
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,380
after I've cloned my four images of it

897
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,360
and I use grep and Linux to see okay

898
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,580
what version and we see what flavor of

899
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,200
Linux is running now I can pivot from

900
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,740
that into my tool I can go to nist.gov

901
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,719
download the Android

902
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,399
files that are known and good and then

903
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,080
remove those from my forensic processing

904
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,980
this is a dope scope I feel weird saying

905
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,940
that again out of the country has

906
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,859
nothing to do with dope it's just a cool

907
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,619
little name wardollar.com it's a defense

908
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,020
contractor in Virginia

909
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,480
it's a Kali Linux monocle so you can

910
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,699
look to see the Wi-Fi addresses the

911
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,619
Bluetooth networks so when you're doing

912
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,119
an on-site inspection of whether you're

913
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,859
doing Red Team whether you're doing

914
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,839
sensitive site exploitation

915
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,480
drug rate whatever

916
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,679
you can look to see all the different

917
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,020
networks oh there's actually an uh Apple

918
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,239
backup server

919
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,739
stored in the storage bin we can see

920
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,200
it's emanating here through this Mac ID

921
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,020
that's not being picked up anywhere else

922
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,359
Nick Gadget didn't need it bought it

923
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,580
anyway but we use this to see is this

924
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,200
activate the Wi-Fi on the voting machine

925
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,240
is what network is this creating same

926
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,660
for the Bluetooth

927
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,680
so the bottom line

928
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,200
we didn't find the dozens of the

929
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,579
machines we investigated over five years

930
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,680
no foreign interference

931
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,900
no domestic interference bad foreign

932
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,280
design the Chinese sewing machine I

933
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,920
wouldn't trust for anything the way it's

934
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
designed right now we haven't found

935
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,460
malware

936
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,800
there's no security updates there's no

937
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,780
internet connectivity and it's such a

938
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,640
diverse

939
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,579
mesh of devices that you wouldn't have a

940
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,220
single point of failure like when uh

941
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,839
Facebook's

942
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,240
their Border guard files were corrupted

943
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,560
they lost their DNS entry and Facebook

944
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
went offline about a year ago they

945
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,260
thought it would tie to Russia Kremlin

946
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,180
or Russia Ukraine I believe

947
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,460
there's no failure because there's such

948
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,260
a

949
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,820
mismatch of machines

950
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,339
even if one voting Precinct was

951
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:00,720
corrupted it wouldn't affect the entire

952
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,520
nation that's a good thing

953
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,320
I definitely didn't care for there's no

954
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,240
encryption of output all the the voting

955
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,599
machine files are written to vote.txt on

956
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,940
a removable USB drive

957
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,680
I have heartache with that

958
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
everyone votes on the admin account I

959
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,400
also have a problem with that

960
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,800
the USB drives are accessible you can

961
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
see where every time I mouse and a

962
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,820
keyboard have been connected or monitor

963
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,200
you can see just the logs

964
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,619
however in the voting machine area

965
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,780
you've got a poll Watcher you're on site

966
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,180
you don't have time to pull USB drive

967
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,060
out load it reboot the machine load your

968
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,440
malware

969
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,540
and get off the X before people have

970
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,740
noticed that you've done something

971
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,299
malicious it's just not

972
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,140
I don't want to say it's technically

973
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,480
possible but it's not humanly possible

974
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,560
because the chances of being caught

975
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,720
doing a level of Espionage like that are

976
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,099
very high that'll be a nation state

977
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,020
incident a lot of blowback

978
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,880
the probability is very small the

979
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,220
greater threat is

980
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,859
the non-encryption of output so no

981
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,720
offense if I give you the USB drive from

982
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,160
the voting Precinct you don't like how

983
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,480
they look you stop on the side of the

984
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,400
road you have on the just have your

985
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,980
laptop use 51 votes for candidate a 49

986
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,480
for B well we're going to change that

987
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,079
100 for a zero for B there's no stop get

988
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,520
measure to add that corruption

989
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,820
so get a little bit ahead of myself

990
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,560
if you have just something as simple as

991
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,020
a lock bag from a bank they're 11 from

992
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,000
Amazon put the loading drives in there

993
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the USB drives lock it give the key to a

994
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,020
deputy

995
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,480
party a is a vaccine the sheriff's car

996
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,160
party B's in the back seat you have

997
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,800
three sets of eyes watching the locked

998
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,560
envelope it's technically encrypted I

999
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,020
mean it's not accessed so you know

1000
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,119
you've got a good output from the voting

1001
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,800
Precinct

1002
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,780
to the headquarters so they tally the

1003
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,099
votes together that would actually be

1004
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,420
far better

1005
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,640
in a very low cost win for a lot of

1006
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,160
local governments again no firewall no

1007
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
anti-virus programs no audit Trail we

1008
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,820
didn't find any voter information on

1009
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,160
this that was a good find

1010
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,020
but again these machines were so old we

1011
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,400
don't see any tampering with them

1012
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,660
because

1013
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,940
writing exploit for a Windows XP a

1014
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,079
Windows 98 machine good luck with that

1015
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,780
another thing if you have

1016
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,660
a software that was the hammer and

1017
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,280
sickle or something like that they

1018
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,839
claimed is on the

1019
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,339
voting machines that can remotely

1020
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,500
include selections

1021
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,359
if you have something like that you're

1022
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,480
not going to have that on 100 machines

1023
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,300
in a classroom at a church where you

1024
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,619
pull them out once every two years

1025
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,540
because somebody could find the evidence

1026
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,579
that there's something corrupt on there

1027
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,260
and again that software if it's removed

1028
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,880
you're going to find it's been removed

1029
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,339
through forensic programs so that's also

1030
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,700
not realistic

1031
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,460
so the short version we haven't found

1032
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,160
evidence of voting machine tampering we

1033
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,839
also don't touch the voting rules we

1034
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,359
don't touch the validation of the ID we

1035
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,859
don't touch that process we don't touch

1036
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,540
what happens after we only look at the

1037
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,400
machine itself

1038
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,859
they're old

1039
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,440
but it's working

1040
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,060
they probably they're probably

1041
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,359
vulnerable to every cve from

1042
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,880
2000 to today but if they're not

1043
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,960
connected to the internet and they're

1044
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,240
only used for voting doesn't matter

1045
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,740
so this actually flew by any questions

1046
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,279
yes

1047
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,579
could you repeat that on a microphone

1048
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,820
please

1049
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,440
um I just had a Curiosities about the

1050
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,599
FTP logs that were identified

1051
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,099
okay from earlier in the presentation

1052
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,660
could you just elaborate kind of on the

1053
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,040
context of that in the background a

1054
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,940
little bit more

1055
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,460
it was a

1056
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,700
log file that looking at a new machine

1057
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,460
or new machine for the village that had

1058
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,800
been Untouched by anyone

1059
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,300
they said the machines had never been

1060
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,220
connected to the internet ever ever's a

1061
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,359
big word

1062
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,760
so when looking at the uh

1063
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,099
Logs with time crunch

1064
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,200
we saw that the machine had been

1065
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,660
connected at some point to the internet

1066
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,940
maybe when it was being

1067
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,040
image not image maybe when it was being

1068
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,839
uh cloned

1069
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,420
for creation but we did see that it had

1070
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,240
been connected and sent files to the FTP

1071
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,820
server in Canada why we don't know

1072
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,339
but we'd seen that replicate on it's

1073
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,900
again so we pivoted from that okay we

1074
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,180
have this WS FTP log

1075
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,640
on this machine we start looking and see

1076
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,040
that on multiples of the same wind vote

1077
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,880
machine

1078
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,619
so we think it was just the setup

1079
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,859
however it was still violates the all if

1080
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,599
the manufacturer said

1081
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,339
it was connected to the internet being

1082
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,040
set up being imaged being cloned okay

1083
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,540
yeah that happens when you're creating

1084
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,460
that many drives at once

1085
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,960
that's an understandable thing and never

1086
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,820
connected ever since okay

1087
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,740
but it was that use of the term legal

1088
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,380
term ever that's what raise the Reds

1089
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,119
like for us

1090
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,200
absolutely thank you

1091
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,359
all right

1092
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,480
you guys aren't a very talkative Bunch

1093
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,060
so I'm just gonna fill in for you so

1094
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,220
um I've

1095
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,980
seen how complex our government's

1096
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,500
procurement process is here

1097
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,300
rightfully so

1098
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,520
um it's a small community and you know

1099
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,800
lots of inbuilt mechanisms to make sure

1100
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,820
that

1101
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,280
the right

1102
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,680
Protocols are followed and things so how

1103
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,380
do you know how decisions are made in

1104
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,160
local state county

1105
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,000
um federal government as to how these

1106
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,339
machines are obtained and I'd say this

1107
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,640
from in 2008 I helped with my dad's

1108
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,520
election campaign in Montana

1109
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,200
um so I got to see a lot of that side of

1110
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
it um and the machines that were used

1111
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,380
then were kind of like what we used to

1112
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,359
take the Iowa Basics like a fill-in

1113
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,400
circle kind of thing yeah so I'm sure

1114
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,839
that there's like lots of trade-offs

1115
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,820
being made about like efficiency and

1116
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,500
accuracy and

1117
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,599
um you know overvotes and all these

1118
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,700
things that figure into it is there

1119
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,160
protocol is there is it just like the

1120
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,900
city council saying we're gonna get this

1121
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,599
one or it comes down to budget once you

1122
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,000
have the main vendor you stick with them

1123
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,800
another piece thank you for reminding me

1124
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,040
is the vendors charge per software

1125
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,800
update per machine so it becomes cost

1126
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,720
prohibitive for them to if even if they

1127
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,900
want to load the latest service patch

1128
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,480
that cost escalates to where the local

1129
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,220
government can't afford it I'm not

1130
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,780
saying nationalize it but there's a

1131
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,460
definite issue there

1132
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,680
budget it's always budget

1133
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,819
thank you

1134
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:18,839
um actually

1135
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,420
I was interested into digital forensics

1136
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,280
just kind of getting into it I was

1137
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,440
wondering if you had any suggestions on

1138
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,900
the tools standards or just general

1139
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,260
education that I could pursue

1140
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,920
I'm not paid by them it's a free course

1141
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,300
um

1142
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,000
Charles Stewart s-t-u-r-t University out

1143
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,280
of Australia has free online Master's

1144
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,560
certifications so you can take a digital

1145
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,800
forensic Master cert in that it's

1146
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,880
we still recording

1147
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,280
okay your connection's broken don't

1148
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,040
listen at home it's four tests open book

1149
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,980
tests but it's good material so it's for

1150
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,920
90 minute classes uh

1151
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,540
it's a good way to get your foot in the

1152
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,339
door to say now it gets a overview of

1153
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:06,359
what it is

1154
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,180
good software program would be for

1155
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,339
Imaging would be go to Magnet or magnets

1156
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:16,260
they keep they making cutesy names but

1157
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,960
magnet forensic.com has a good Imaging

1158
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,839
tool as well as ftk's Imaging tool and

1159
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,740
then it's cluji but autopsy is a

1160
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,780
freeware open source Community tool

1161
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,760
that's a good entry level point for

1162
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,160
digital it's what we taught over at NATO

1163
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,339
because you know some countries can

1164
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,380
shouldn't because how I feel about

1165
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,660
pricing but some countries don't want to

1166
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,099
spend thirty thousand dollars per

1167
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,280
license per Examiner

1168
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,260
other countries do have the funds so we

1169
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,579
settled on

1170
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,859
autopsy it's a free one you can build it

1171
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,759
to make it what you want but

1172
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,720
it wouldn't hold up in a court of law

1173
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,240
because it's so customizable however to

1174
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,160
understand how things work okay if you

1175
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,720
understand the basics then you can

1176
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,280
understand the push button forensics of

1177
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,200
loading the device get your output and

1178
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,839
just scroll through for whatever PDF so

1179
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,420
bottom line of

1180
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,400
Charles Stewart SD York University

1181
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,220
that'll get you a master's search it's a

1182
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,460
very easy serve and then I'll open the

1183
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,420
door to

1184
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,920
you need the two pieces of the

1185
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
acquisition tool and they need autopsy

1186
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,359
tool

1187
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,020
thank you very much

1188
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,140
another thing to look at not to

1189
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,099
monologue here with look at druva druva

1190
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,960
it's more of what we used at some of the

1191
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,160
corporate engagements where you connect

1192
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,200
to the endpoint it can actually pull

1193
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,940
down the key files so if somebody was

1194
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,980
manipulating that the team would ever do

1195
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,839
it during the pandemic but manipulate a

1196
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,060
receipt for visiting a doctor's office

1197
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,099
and providing eighty dollars of pastries

1198
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,339
as an office visit to 800 in embezzling

1199
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:54,599
money

1200
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,339
that's something you can find quickly

1201
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,020
through instead of Imaging the entire

1202
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,540
hard drive from the user's computer

1203
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,099
not that anybody would ever commit

1204
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,720
stupid fraud like that working for a

1205
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,040
pharmaceutical company during the

1206
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,640
pandemic but

1207
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,540
don't deal with stupid stuff

1208
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,140
thank you

1209
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,959
[Applause]
