1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,820
foreign

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,200
everybody uh welcome to my talk

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,639
um I'm the thing standing between you

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,840
and lunch

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,219
so you're either going to have an early

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,440
lunch or a late one depending on how

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,260
many questions you ask at the end

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,199
um we detectives call that a hint as to

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,699
how many questions you should actually

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,480
be asking at the end eating in to your

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,060
own time

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,940
um as the introduction said uh I've

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,160
moved from a round building in

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,079
Cheltenham where there's five thousand

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,780
people working on a daily basis with a

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,399
team of about

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,760
70 to a very small team some of whom are

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,500
sat in the front row

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,579
today

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,440
they were they were the ones whipping

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
and hollering

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,820
um thank you for the Applause you might

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,719
not want to upload at the uh at the the

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,039
end of this

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,040
so I lead a small team we mostly do

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
digital forensics but we also

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
investigate cyber crime as it's

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,740
committed across the island

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,340
and for those of you who work with um

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,320
are in companies you'll probably

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,820
recognize that the weakest link to any

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,100
um cyber security measure is the is the

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,180
individual

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,979
so I thought I'll show you a

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,400
representation about what it's like

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,020
when you're trying to tell somebody to

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,039
not click the link

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,619
I know it's easy for your mind to wander

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,880
it often feels like that's what we do

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
when we try to sell somebody to not

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,060
click in the link their attention just

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,700
goes monkey plays symbols in the head

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,500
even the monkey eventually says listen

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,460
to what you're being told

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,899
so our day job is the extraction and

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,640
Analysis of electronic devices

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
the assisting the investigation of

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
cyber-enabled crime so those are crimes

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,720
that can be committed on the street

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
um not necessarily just with a computer

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,760
so frauds

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
um that type of thing we assist the

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,260
Cyber investigators with it

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,660
uh we investigate cyber dependent crimes

55
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,220
those are crimes that can only be

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,160
committed by the use of a computer so

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,500
that'd be hacking uh Etc

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,060
um this is a marvelous machine we use

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,980
for all our investigations this was

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,560
purpose built designed by ourselves

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,800
very high spec system

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
it's a glorified gaming machine if you

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,660
like because of the data processing we

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,640
have to do it has to be high quality

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,900
stuff

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,560
we get our exhibits to come in through a

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
chain of custody we have to ensure that

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,720
the the chain of custody is correct

69
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,180
um and these are just very quickly for

70
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,680
those who weren't at the workshop

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
yesterday

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,220
um some of the software we use to

73
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,180
extract data this one's from phones

74
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,659
um we use Tableau devices which are read

75
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,560
only

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,280
because we need to ensure the uh the

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,739
quality and the Integrity of the

78
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,360
evidence

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,540
foreign

80
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,860
to go through

81
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,080
investigations we've actually done so

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,299
these are these were actual

83
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,620
investigations

84
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,720
uh hopefully

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,120
with somebody from data protection in

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,580
the audience hopefully I've redacted all

87
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,379
the details

88
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,680
um that are personalized

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,780
so this came in from our colleagues in

90
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,400
the Cayman Island Bureau of financial

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,480
investigation so this particular victim

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
thought he was on a trading platform

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,340
ffxtrader.com

94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,079
he was told his account would reflect

95
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
the Investments he had made

96
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
um screenshots were provided which I'll

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
show you

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,780
um the website was in fact controlled by

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,360
a fraudster and figures shown within

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
user accounts corresponds to real world

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Investments so there was a lot of money

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,419
going through this web page

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
um and my colleagues from Cayman Islands

104
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
Bureau of financial investigation

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Pacific followed where the

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
cryptocurrency was going and I

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,979
concentrated on the web page itself

108
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,580
so this was the victim's screenshot

109
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,139
showing the amount of money he'd

110
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,020
invested in this company

111
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,419
so that's a lot of money it's certainly

112
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,180
a lot of money to me

113
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,940
and this is one of the things he got um

114
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,860
sent from them

115
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,699
um

116
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,100
showing the profit he had made that day

117
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,880
which of course wasn't profit

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,919
so what we do with that is we take the

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,660
information that's given on there and

120
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,400
investigate to see if we can find out

121
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,380
who's responsible for this particular

122
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,840
website

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,960
Alex Larson

124
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,820
PhD well that's pretty impressive isn't

125
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,759
it he must be a good guy he's got a PhD

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,680
although most people with PhD call

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,900
themselves Dr Alex Larson rather than

128
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,060
PhD

129
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
so we looked to see if we could find

130
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,840
anybody who is Alex Larson if online

131
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,820
setting is just not going to achieve a

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,979
great deal if you're putting Dr Alex

133
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,020
Larson you get a lot of doctors all over

134
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,199
the world so I didn't go on to use by

135
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,000
the some of the tools that lamb was

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,520
talking about yesterday simply because I

137
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
have no idea who this person is and it

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,060
would be really difficult

139
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,639
to trace after them and follow through

140
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,900
there

141
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,840
seven New Gate Street however we did

142
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,780
check up on its uh a premises where you

143
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,620
can register your company at

144
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,419
and that's it

145
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,580
the telephone number itself we looked

146
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,199
into

147
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,100
and it's everybody has this telephone

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,460
number used in various different frauds

149
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,319
um I think it was an O2 number it was a

150
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,060
mobile number

151
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,419
this company FXX trading which is

152
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,520
dealing in hundreds of thousands if not

153
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,819
millions of stolen funds daily use a

154
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,259
mobile phone

155
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,319
highly unlikely

156
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,539
and when I looked at the page cells

157
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,360
itself uh the webpage sorry the page is

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,680
pulling down stuff from tradingview.com

159
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,919
basically that was live market feeds

160
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,539
that the company were pretending with

161
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,220
theirs in fact they were just bringing

162
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,440
it down from another company another

163
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
legitimate company

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,960
uh these were the times and conditions

165
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,280
so the company is registered in the

166
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
Marshall Islands which is another

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
offshore

168
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,139
um Financial operation

169
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,780
operated by Bond local Consulting from

170
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,520
Bulgaria

171
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,380
neither of these places a law

172
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,940
enforcement friendly so there was little

173
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,699
Point going after them

174
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,220
uh I did a check at company's house with

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,380
a company found this particular company

176
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,199
as you can see it's been dissolved

177
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,180
the the gentleman who was the director

178
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,699
was Bulgarian he was born in 1958 and

179
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,259
that was the only data I could get

180
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,259
um and that was the the final notice

181
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,819
um so the graduated for the company it's

182
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,620
quite common before us does the register

183
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,940
a company

184
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,440
um and after the first year when they

185
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,419
don't file reports then companies have

186
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,139
strike them off

187
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,840
um but the financial conduct Authority

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,500
in London had already put out warnings

189
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,060
about them

190
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,880
so they were on the radar in the UK but

191
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,539
they weren't here

192
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,680
um

193
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,379
oh so I've got to go back one the the

194
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,139
basics of this was we we didn't get very

195
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,479
far in finding out who the Cyber

196
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,000
criminals behind it were

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,339
so the alternative and what we do a lot

198
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,799
of is disruption so I had the web page

199
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,200
taken offline so nobody else could fall

200
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,919
victim to this particular fraud

201
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,500
um I think the financial Bureau managed

202
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,240
to

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,019
um get quite a lot the funds held and I

204
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,040
think it's still going through the

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,779
process of the victim getting that back

206
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,240
but it's a long complex process because

207
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,240
of where they were held

208
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,480
so the next one

209
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,800
um this was an email sent to government

210
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,019
employees

211
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,519
yes unfortunately even government

212
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,320
employees click the link that's why I

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
showed the Homer thing to begin with

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
um so info facts at gov dot KY

215
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,980
pertaining to come from an internal

216
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,399
address in fact as you can see it's SSD

217
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,980
multi-state

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,100
um

219
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,440
audio0485 which is what the person was

220
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,620
asked to play was in fact an HTML link

221
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,779
it wasn't it wasn't an MP3

222
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,220
um

223
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,459
so I looked at the the HTML document

224
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,320
um ignored a bit in blue that was that

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,240
was highlighted an error it's about I

226
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,680
want you to look at is a bit with the

227
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,240
yellow box around it

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,140
which is the the web page of

229
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,140
the the link was going to go to

230
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,060
generally speaking with this what I do

231
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,980
is I copy and paste the URL put it into

232
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,080
a browser and see what it actually is so

233
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,320
I did that and got this

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,640
which was just weird

235
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,620
um this is a legitimate Microsoft site

236
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,959
this is a legitimate Microsoft login

237
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,420
so I had no choice but to click on the

238
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,980
link itself to see where it was actually

239
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,380
going to do

240
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,060
um it wasn't on the government system

241
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,820
before anybody starts to think it was uh

242
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,760
it was on Cali I think I used it

243
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,500
um but what I did when I was doing the

244
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,260
password is I do I did a network capture

245
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,540
at the same time so I captured the

246
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,519
network traffic from the web page as I

247
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
was putting the password in

248
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,899
um and this is where it turned up

249
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,000
so the reason it was sending me to

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Microsoft login page is it already got

251
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,380
the data itself and had an immediate

252
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,800
sending out so if you see the Top Line

253
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,200
which one's a pointer so this oh sorry

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
this top line here where it posted my

255
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,459
password

256
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,380
but then immediately brought up the

257
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,399
Microsoft page

258
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,839
and uh I hope you liked the password I

259
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,579
used

260
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm not sure if the actors liked it too

261
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,540
much

262
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,500
um

263
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,880
again

264
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,260
there was

265
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,019
very little we could do with this it was

266
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,060
another and if you've been involved in

267
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,480
any of these types of Investigation

268
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
I wish that the pound for a dollar if

269
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,579
for every time this was a GoDaddy

270
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,880
registered namecheap held web page this

271
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
one was as well they are very on law

272
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,579
enforcement unfriendly

273
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,339
so we can't send legal orders on them

274
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,200
but my experience tends to be that

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,980
they're not that good

276
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,959
um hmm

277
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,480
so this one

278
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,120
this one with I this one really annoyed

279
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,579
me you'll find out why in a moment

280
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,220
so this was a company who were claiming

281
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,920
to assist people who'd been victims of a

282
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,500
Ponzi scheme so these people had already

283
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,220
lost money to a Ponzi scheme

284
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,040
I think this one was dolphin trust which

285
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,360
been dealt with about the German

286
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,860
authorities

287
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,700
so people had lost had already lost

288
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,620
tens of thousands of dollars in this and

289
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,540
this company is saying oh by the way we

290
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,060
can get you your money back

291
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,380
and

292
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,760
we won't charge you for it

293
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
now

294
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
once you registered with them you got

295
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,220
this second email which came was

296
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,779
supposed to come from the fraud desk

297
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,360
investigation department of the royal

298
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,060
Cayman Islands police force

299
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,339
we are not a police force we are a

300
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,500
police service

301
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,899
attached is a place to order for refund

302
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,000
and this is what was attached

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,820
uses our badge

304
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,639
signed by my commissioner thinks that

305
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,160
that's not your signature

306
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
and it states that the the money was

307
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,620
being held in a

308
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,019
an account in the Cayman National Bank

309
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,279
um obviously it's not an actual account

310
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,079
um when I spoke to the people involved

311
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,700
um about the victims who'd gone a little

312
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,760
bit further in them the the company says

313
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,740
that okay so we're going to charge you

314
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,320
about ten thousand for us to access this

315
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
Cayman National Bank funds

316
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,120
once we've got the ten thousand we'll

317
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,160
return it to you um together with the

318
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,860
money that you lost in the dolphin

319
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,380
um dolphin which one was this there's

320
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,200
two of them

321
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,420
uh yes sorry

322
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,000
um and I knew we'd seen this one before

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,740
and there was another one now this

324
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,519
claimed to be for the rofx scam again

325
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,500
that was another Ponzi scheme where

326
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,440
people had lost money

327
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,060
these criminals are talking to people

328
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,519
who've already lost money and they were

329
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,380
making quite a lot of money about from

330
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,399
it

331
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,800
so again we disrupted them and took the

332
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
web page offline so there was no day I

333
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,200
was gonna fall victim to this

334
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,360
foreign

335
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,300
[Music]

336
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,199
signature but I've seen it often enough

337
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,779
to know it wasn't

338
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,880
um the people involved

339
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
um in this and we got all the names

340
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,139
they've got all the details

341
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,540
um just no Trace number whatsoever the

342
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,579
company wasn't registered anywhere

343
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,180
despite the fact it says that it also

344
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,220
actually had a YouTube

345
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,420
um page

346
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,519
where there was all these nice Souls on

347
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,459
there saying oh this is a great company

348
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,860
except another actually mentioned them

349
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,000
by name

350
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
there was people who worked for them

351
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
saying oh we're really good we're really

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,279
brilliant at what we do

353
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,079
um and then there was people who said oh

354
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
I've used this company they were all

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,620
Australian for some reason I could use

356
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,060
this company and I got all this money

357
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,959
back

358
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,579
and they were really great but they

359
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,440
never actually mentioned this company by

360
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,779
name so they were fraudulently put in

361
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,120
reviews on YouTube for people to think

362
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,100
well this is a legitimate company

363
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,660
if I was also taken offline

364
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,019
this is the one I've dealt with most

365
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,860
recently

366
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
um

367
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,100
sorry go back to these

368
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,079
so this was the related to that FFF

369
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,699
Global and again the used

370
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,339
um a mobile phone

371
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,560
there's a contact details

372
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,500
I do phone these numbers up and

373
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,279
it's nobody ever answers

374
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,620
um miter passage North Greenwich is

375
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,959
actually a really poor premises and a

376
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,339
contact with them but they didn't have a

377
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,620
company registered at their address

378
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,740
I was really shocked and surprised

379
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,660
uh

380
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,839
so this one is a little bit one of the

381
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,540
more technical ones we did again it was

382
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,680
a phishing email that came into

383
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,620
government addresses

384
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,380
studio

385
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,240
um.com

386
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,180
um the good news was if you know to

387
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,519
understand what these terminology means

388
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
three or two means that it didn't get

389
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,399
there

390
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,620
so I was quite relaxed already because

391
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,199
the the web page didn't open in fact

392
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,240
when you go on to it it says straight

393
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,180
away that it was that it was closed

394
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,940
this is a screenshot of the

395
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,180
investigation we did where we took the

396
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,220
um the host of the past one of the

397
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,899
people who'd open the email

398
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,419
we took the host put it onto a forensic

399
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,579
system and downloaded it so I can find

400
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,679
the actual email that was sent to the

401
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,419
person

402
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,400
um and from the email I can find the

403
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,760
malicious link or the malicious file

404
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,099
uh the the reason we do that is to see

405
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,780
what it does

406
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,699
so I initially

407
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,540
um in Linux just carted it to see where

408
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,580
it was

409
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,720
um it's JavaScript

410
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,860
another knock knock joke about

411
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,539
JavaScript but we'll probably leave the

412
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,120
jokes for another time

413
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,100
um not the easy thing to reverse

414
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,080
Engineers it didn't bother a great deal

415
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,660
the interesting thing for me

416
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,780
was this part here

417
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,600
so the first thing it was bringing down

418
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,400
was a version of jQuery 1.9.1

419
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,520
I think jQuery is about

420
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,260
3.8.7 now

421
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,740
so the actors were using such old script

422
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,660
that they had to pull down

423
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,360
an older version of jQuery to make the

424
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,980
damn thing work

425
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,360
and in fact it didn't work anyway

426
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,760
the reason it didn't work is the

427
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,039
JavaScript was was was

428
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,820
um was not enabled properly code the

429
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,900
error code

430
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,039
it relates to VBS script

431
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,760
um

432
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,700
and I think it was 2019 Microsoft banned

433
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,400
VBS script from its systems

434
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,039
so it was never going to work

435
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,720
it was

436
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,539
um a close Escape but it shows you the

437
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,700
The Perils of

438
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,380
being involved in these type of things

439
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,179
are just going to catch up with my notes

440
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,919
oh

441
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,260
so that's the types of Investigations we

442
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,059
do because that's the type of crime we

443
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,799
pick up on that's the type of crime

444
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,419
that's reported to us I'm going to talk

445
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,340
more about that in a moment

446
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,559
and somebody asked Laura earlier about

447
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,059
how many data breaches have been

448
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,919
reported to the Ombudsman I can tell you

449
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,480
how many have been reported to us and

450
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,280
that's zero

451
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,200
I know some I know that happened because

452
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
I've read about them on the ombudsman's

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,340
report but nobody ever reports on to us

454
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,860
I don't know why

455
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,399
them

456
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
so

457
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,380
the world economic Forum has recently

458
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,740
published it's 2023 risks

459
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,960
at number eight

460
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,940
in the next two years

461
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,179
and in the next 10 years

462
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,280
widespread cyber crime and cyber

463
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,340
security are non-risks they're

464
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,059
anticipated risks this is not some group

465
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,500
who have got no idea what they're

466
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,120
talking about this is a world economic

467
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,640
Forum one of the most senior people in

468
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,700
the in in the world determine what risks

469
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,860
there are

470
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,059
unsurprisingly in 10 years most of the

471
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,600
bigger risks related to climate change

472
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,720
what they said about cyber crime was

473
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,480
alongside the Horizon cyber crime so

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,160
it's going to happen

475
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,760
attempts to disrupt critical

476
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,419
technology-enabled resources and

477
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,820
services will become more common

478
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,080
quite a few risk threat companies are

479
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
saying for this year and probably next

480
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,640
year we're going to see an increase a

481
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,220
decrease in in ransomware attacks but an

482
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,740
increase in really serious attacks

483
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,000
designed to take down your

484
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
infrastructure completely

485
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,120
um technology risks are not solely

486
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,340
limited to Rogue actors sophisticated

487
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,100
analysis of larger data sets will enable

488
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,620
the misuse of personal information so

489
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,059
they're talking about the threat from

490
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,500
soluble criminals they're also talking

491
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,140
about Insider threats

492
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,000
that's the thing that's going to be a

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,860
threat in two years and in ten years

494
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,960
we are almost uh

495
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,900
war with cyber criminals

496
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,360
and if anybody's

497
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,820
ever had any military training you

498
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,320
probably recognize

499
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,260
the center of gravity

500
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,160
it's been around since the

501
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,480
18th century

502
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,940
um one of the best and most influential

503
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,039
journals of all time said

504
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,020
it's the Hub of all power and movement

505
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,380
on which everything depends

506
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,400
so this talk is about looking at how the

507
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,919
cyber security community of Cayman can

508
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,659
work with law enforcement

509
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,440
so it refers to those sources of

510
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,240
strength and balance

511
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,520
it is that characteristic capability or

512
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,559
locality from which the force derives at

513
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,900
Freedom of action physical strength

514
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,020
although it will to fight

515
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,120
it's a common practice in the military

516
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,520
to say that the easiest way to take down

517
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,860
an enemy is to take down the center of

518
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,720
gravity

519
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,360
and so the military tried to do that but

520
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,860
they also tried to protect their own

521
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,360
center of gravity

522
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,159
so if we look at this in relation to

523
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,340
cyber criminals what characteristics do

524
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,900
they have

525
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,700
well the very money orientated

526
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,460
and they really don't give a about

527
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,140
who the Target and for what

528
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,380
um

529
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,720
if you think some of the some of the

530
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,000
jobs I dealt with I dealt with or

531
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,059
investigated when Hackney comes so we're

532
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,440
ransomware then they were taken

533
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,360
completely offline in the middle of the

534
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,120
pandemic

535
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,980
the effect on them and the community was

536
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,080
huge cyber criminals didn't give Adam

537
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,020
about that all he wanted was the money

538
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,580
that's what characterizes them that's

539
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,100
what they do

540
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,500
capability

541
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,820
well that's huge

542
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,220
um they can get into most if not any

543
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,900
infrastructure if they're determined to

544
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,400
do so

545
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,580
the locality the worldwide which for law

546
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
enforcement makes it really difficult

547
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,179
because it's quite difficult for us to

548
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,280
track them down

549
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,559
if they're in law enforcement on law

550
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,440
enforcement unfriendly countries

551
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,140
where to fight they've absolutely got a

552
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,580
wealthy fight and the reason for that is

553
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,620
they're making a lot of money

554
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,299
and they'll continue to make a lot of

555
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,340
money

556
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
so protection starts with the idea of

557
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,419
attacking the enemy center of gravity

558
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,220
while protecting your own there's three

559
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,659
phases to it

560
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,080
critical capabilities what are cyber

561
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,840
criminal capabilities we just discussed

562
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,860
that

563
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,440
what are requirements what resources do

564
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
they need

565
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,960
but they've all must get limited

566
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,299
resources now and the reason for that is

567
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,860
because the amount of money they can get

568
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,240
and the amount of money they can pay to

569
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,799
people and the amount of infrastructure

570
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
they can get

571
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,559
so the FBI run the thing called ic3

572
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,559
which is internet Center for cyber crime

573
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,620
I think but they report figures so

574
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,679
this is for the last five years and then

575
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,520
obviously 2022 been the last one

576
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,559
so this is the losses that have been

577
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,059
reported to ICC and as I talked about

578
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,260
earlier we all know there's a huge

579
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,000
amount of Under reporting so I think

580
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,980
this figure is nowhere near what the

581
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,100
actual figure is not even close

582
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,620
the interesting thing for me

583
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,620
was the the number of complaints has

584
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,179
actually dropped

585
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,860
but the volumes have increased

586
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,539
significantly

587
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,780
the most costly one you'd be unsurprised

588
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,919
to hear was

589
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,860
um BEC business email compromise that

590
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,740
was 2.7 billion in 2022

591
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,659
and critical vulnerabilities what are

592
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,240
cyber criminals vulnerabilities those

593
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,760
aspects are components of critical

594
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,559
requirements are deficient or vulnerable

595
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,960
to attack or indirect attack

596
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,179
I'm not sure they've got that many to be

597
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,659
honest with you

598
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,919
um when I worked for the ncsc we did

599
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,900
take down a lot of infrastructure we

600
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,000
took down trickbot twice I think and it

601
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,460
still came back

602
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,740
um because they're not that vulnerable

603
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,500
and and we are not allowed

604
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,559
to attack them technically

605
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,840
so what's my team's center of gravity

606
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,460
so

607
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,559
we have the ability to disrupt to

608
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
protect the community I think most

609
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,220
people in here probably

610
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,080
from companies that'll probably get

611
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,940
really good cyber security you've got

612
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,440
really good infrastructure behind you

613
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
and a lot of people the people out there

614
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
the people who are losing money don't

615
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,980
and it's my job to protect them as best

616
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,960
we can

617
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,600
so we do disrupt where we find I think

618
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,039
from memory I think we took down 25

619
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,100
fake wealth management websites last

620
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,120
year

621
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,439
I think it was up at 25.

622
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,059
um we have the resources and capacity to

623
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,820
disrupt and as I said have done so quite

624
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,520
successfully so far

625
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,299
critical vulnerabilities

626
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,679
intelligence is our critical

627
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
vulnerability

628
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,179
we don't know what's happening out there

629
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,240
because no one tells us no one says by

630
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,460
the way John we had this fishing attack

631
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,980
this is what we did about it

632
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,159
I don't know is it reputational damage

633
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,039
or it's just no cyber crime happening on

634
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,779
this island at all

635
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,059
I would like to think it's a second I

636
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,059
think it's more the first

637
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,880
as I've shown we can take these websites

638
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,559
down in fact if you've got enough money

639
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,120
you can subscribe to a company called

640
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,460
Netcraft and they'll do what I do for

641
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,419
you

642
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,460
because it is time consuming it does

643
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,000
take a while

644
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,799
um what I can get done quite quickly now

645
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,460
is when we get some fishing links and I

646
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,320
can normally get that page flagged as

647
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,120
malicious quite quickly and then work to

648
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,419
get it taken down a little bit later

649
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,640
so the visual representation of what the

650
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,380
center of gravity actually looks like

651
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,419
and this is important because this is

652
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,279
where you're likely to be attacked if

653
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,320
you like these are the things that are

654
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
most likely to cause your organization

655
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,580
to fall

656
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,460
it's where the Cyber criminals are going

657
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,919
to attack us so it's I'll explain how it

658
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,900
is in cyber security because it is

659
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,539
militaristic leadership

660
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,419
for me personally leadership means the

661
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,400
government systems so I work very

662
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,100
closely with the um the office of the

663
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,900
Seesaw in the government

664
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
um Palm Green

665
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,520
to investigate incidents that happen to

666
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,080
them with a view to protecting them

667
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,700
because if the government system goes

668
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,860
down we're in trouble

669
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,200
I guess if your system goes down you're

670
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,820
in trouble as well so leadership is

671
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,559
really

672
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,779
um your network if you like rather than

673
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,059
the individuals themselves

674
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,360
system Essentials uh the software that

675
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,799
you would use to protect your system

676
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,200
attack that you're very near the center

677
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,700
of the attack

678
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,640
infrastructure

679
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,799
we look at the infrastructure and came

680
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,720
on

681
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,559
um

682
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,980
we desalinate water

683
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,960
is there a computer involved in that

684
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,059
operation

685
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,039
cuc

686
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,260
we import a lot of stuff I think I saw

687
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,679
Leon here is

688
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,200
um we we import Goods what happens if

689
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,360
the supermarkets lose the ability to

690
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,760
import Goods what does that do to our

691
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,559
national infrastructure

692
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,900
population is where it says field and

693
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,120
Military uh are probably you guys you

694
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,700
guys ever see seesaws are involved in

695
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,100
cyber security you're actually at the

696
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,720
outside of the Ring they consider that

697
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
attacking you is probably not really

698
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,279
going to do a great deal because if they

699
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,080
if they attack you they'll just get

700
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
another one that's what it means on the

701
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,980
battlefield

702
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,539
killer Soldier another one comes along

703
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,220
one of the vulnerabilities I talked

704
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,899
about was

705
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,580
um nobody tells us anything and I

706
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,320
appreciate it's not that easy to report

707
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,559
stuff like this to us so working with

708
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,559
the office of the sea so this is going

709
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,960
to be coming out very soon it's in beta

710
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,220
at the moment and we've got a few more

711
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,740
tweaks but it's the ability to report a

712
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,600
cyber incident to his direct to come

713
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,880
straight into my office

714
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,820
now that could be uh

715
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,940
uh uh text you get could be a phishing

716
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,380
email you get it doesn't really matter

717
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,419
send it to us and we'll take the

718
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,860
infrastructure down

719
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,940
I know a lot of people aren't that I.T

720
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,360
friendly

721
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,100
um but I just need somebody who is ID

722
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,799
friendly to use the form and report it

723
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,659
to us and then we can protect the

724
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,340
vulnerable people out there who are not

725
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,120
I.T friendly I can get that link flag is

726
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,679
malicious really quickly so if anybody

727
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,299
does click on it there's nothing bad

728
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,220
going to happen to them

729
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,260
in addition to that

730
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,580
um some of the other things we've got

731
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,919
planned for this year is we're going to

732
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,399
reform the cset

733
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,860
um we can't call it that because Hazard

734
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,740
management have copyrighted the terms

735
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,380
out for here and then personally I would

736
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,179
like to thank Hazard management for the

737
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,760
alert this morning

738
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,159
I had to turn my phone off in the end

739
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,559
Aubrey said you know there's another I'm

740
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,120
fed up acknowledging and it's still

741
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,460
going off

742
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,179
um

743
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,640
so we are we're going to get some

744
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,039
critical people together to do that to

745
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,600
support that we've reached out to the

746
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,580
ncsc and they've agreed to help us do

747
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,380
exercising and we're hoping to expand

748
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,899
that wider to the community

749
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,480
we're looking to get on the NCS these

750
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,279
early Warner system that's providing

751
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,720
them with

752
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,860
um

753
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,380
critical infrastructure IP addresses

754
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,659
which they can keep an eye on and say oh

755
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,460
by the way we've seen this bad thing on

756
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,740
this IP address it's not going to work

757
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,600
as well as it does in the UK because of

758
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,880
how our system works but it's better

759
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,679
than nothing

760
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,919
uh we're also going to be working with

761
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,700
ncsc's active cyber defense team

762
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,860
and I mean know these guys at their

763
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,260
conference in in Belfast

764
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,120
haven't worked there I know the

765
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,820
capabilities and it's something I'm you

766
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,700
know I don't mind I do reach out to my

767
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,559
old colleagues wherever they are so I'm

768
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,000
going to work for dartry some of the

769
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,100
work for some other places I've got a

770
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,840
really good network of people who can

771
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,320
help us

772
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,260
so

773
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,520
the key questions

774
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,640
the key questions I want everybody who

775
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,000
works in cyber security in here

776
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,179
to consider is

777
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,279
um

778
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,380
this isn't a machine I must have added

779
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,419
it yesterday

780
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,960
um so the US finds itself Finds Its

781
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,159
center of gravity in the fight against

782
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,840
Ransom but I didn't think of this the

783
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,640
the US has of course have already done

784
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,899
it

785
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,880
and they have formed the ransomware task

786
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,440
group

787
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,539
and their job so this is about

788
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,279
ransomware but I think the message is

789
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,559
behind it are equally valid for what

790
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,720
we're doing now victim support ensure

791
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,340
the victims of ransomware incidents

792
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,279
receive the necessary report support to

793
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,020
restore services

794
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,020
and minimize damage

795
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,720
I can tell you uncategorically oh sorry

796
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,580
I can tell you categorically

797
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
that if you if your systems are hit by

798
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,340
ransomware you are going to have to call

799
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,500
in a Circ

800
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,620
um computer incident response team

801
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,860
because we haven't got the capability

802
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,159
to properly investigate that because

803
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,340
these guys are very intrusive these

804
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,799
attacks are huge and I've never dealt

805
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,419
with the series ransomware attack and

806
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,000
I've dealt with a lot of them and these

807
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,279
are major companies even semantic and

808
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,600
softballs had to bring in the cir

809
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,120
company because that that's what they do

810
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,039
because if you don't get rid of the

811
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,080
actor they're still going to be doing

812
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,700
you

813
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,919
so we do want to to provide victim

814
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,299
support and that's one of the reasons

815
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,580
we're forming the cset as well to look

816
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,200
at individuals

817
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,360
um around the cyber security Community

818
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,580
who can respond quite quickly in those

819
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,059
early days that's not going to negate

820
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,359
the need to do uh a ciar company

821
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,359
unfortunately

822
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,239
collecting data and metrics will improve

823
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,540
the cyber cyber Securities communities

824
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,699
Collective understanding of ransomware

825
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,500
and as I said it's not just ransomware

826
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,780
it's cyber attacks in general

827
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,899
but we work in silos books we work in

828
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,879
silos we get the stuff that comes in you

829
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,500
get fishing emails I know you get

830
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,480
targeted people try to go at your

831
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,760
vulnerabilities I know they do that

832
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,000
that's just life online

833
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,099
if you don't want that there's a little

834
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,839
plug at the back of it with a blue or a

835
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,460
yellow cable just pull it out and you'll

836
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,899
be fine you won't be getting any more

837
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,659
cyber attacks until then you're gonna

838
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,760
get them

839
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,540
um

840
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,060
but where's the data collected so a lot

841
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,699
of the regulatory bodies

842
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,160
um have got licenses for our threat

843
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,099
intelligence company that we upload and

844
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,240
speak to each other we're hoping to

845
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,400
extend that further out

846
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,500
partner engagement that's what I'm

847
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,880
trying to do I'm trying to engage

848
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
partners and say hello

849
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,800
um continuous Improvement

850
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,780
learning from lessons

851
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,400
intelligence and integration I'm going

852
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
to run through this quickly because I'm

853
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,760
running out of time uh campaign

854
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,619
coordination

855
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,780
so the US have decided that this is

856
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,060
their center of gravity but to protect

857
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,760
companies and businesses in the US

858
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,720
it's a presidential LED campaign because

859
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,839
it was Mr Biden who started it

860
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,660
foreign

861
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,079
as a community what is our center of

862
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,579
gravity and this is what I want you to

863
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,740
consider for your own organizations

864
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,540
what are your critical capabilities

865
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,280
and more importantly for us as a

866
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,780
community what are our capabilities to

867
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,400
work together

868
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,980
what are requirements what resources and

869
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,780
means exist to enable a community

870
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,820
critical capability to become fully

871
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,440
operational while the stumbling blocks

872
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,640
doing it

873
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,500
and what are our vulnerabilities

874
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,000
um I think having talked about water

875
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,440
food

876
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,780
electricity

877
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,579
um I personally have a view of what our

878
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,380
most greatest vulnerabilities are

879
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,359
so we have to look at capabilities and

880
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,280
you might say John

881
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,339
is there even a problem does a problem

882
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,020
actually exist

883
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,460
and to do that you have to do a

884
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,800
capability audit

885
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,020
which is test the measures to the

886
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,119
current system against the problem a

887
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,160
threat I've explained what this writer

888
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,220
is what capability audits do you do

889
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,260
and if you carry out a capability audit

890
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,060
you end up thinking the problem is

891
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,220
bigger than we thought it's getting

892
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,619
bigger than we would like

893
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,359
our current answer to the problem is

894
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,220
getting smaller and the timeline is

895
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,980
shorter longer than the plan for

896
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,160
I can tell you that if you do get hit by

897
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,079
ransomware if you do have a data breach

898
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,640
the problem is much bigger than you

899
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,140
thought

900
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,140
imagine going into work tomorrow to your

901
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,880
to your offices to your businesses

902
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,579
wherever and you do not have a computer

903
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,339
system at all

904
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:26,040
I spoke at this last year and I think I

905
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,740
told this story the one of the very

906
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,359
first conference calls we held with

907
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,920
Hackney Council

908
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,760
um

909
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,619
they said oh it's great we've got we've

910
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,740
got a plan for this where's your plan

911
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,000
oh God it's on the computer

912
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,859
took the month to restore the services

913
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,400
month

914
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,060
so this is where we sit with our little

915
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,220
balance of center of gravity

916
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,040
it won't take much to ruin the center of

917
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,940
gravity and if we think it's not local

918
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,820
this is this is um some kits and Nevis

919
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,740
who were hit by ransomware in January

920
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,279
this year

921
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,200
they said we can't afford to pay the

922
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,420
ransom and they probably couldn't

923
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,339
and didn't

924
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,839
and they couldn't run their essential

925
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
government services because it was a

926
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,040
government Network that was taken down

927
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,200
and that's why I do what I can with the

928
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,640
Seesaw to try to protect the

929
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,160
government's Network

930
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,280
our leadership but you guys can fill

931
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,320
into that by providing it with

932
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
intelligence that's right so we really

933
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,680
understand what is happening because

934
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,380
this is real

935
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,720
two weeks ago the data appeared on the

936
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,579
dart web

937
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:46,260
and there's a lot of it and it's named

938
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,060
tells you exactly what the files are

939
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,880
I don't know if they have I don't know

940
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,680
if they've got data laws Laura but I

941
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,940
think they might be having to reported

942
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,599
to their own movement

943
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,099
so in closing

944
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,460
to go back over the center of gravity

945
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,680
refers to those sources of strength of

946
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,660
balance

947
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,660
it is our characteristic capability or

948
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,640
locality from which the force derives

949
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,460
its freedom of action

950
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,940
physical strength or will to fight

951
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,540
what is our will to fight against cyber

952
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,500
attack

953
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,380
to help protect the Cayman Islands

954
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,440
thank you any questions or suggestions

955
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,839
I'm open to suggestions

956
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,240
and hope the suggestions probably it's

957
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,119
lunchtime but I've got the big red sign

958
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,099
that says time's up

959
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,839
but thank you very much for your

960
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,119
attention hopefully it's been

961
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,520
educational if nothing else

962
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,759
foreign
