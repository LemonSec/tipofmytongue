1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,340
thank you

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,040
good morning everybody thanks for the

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,480
introduction

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,180
um that's taken about half of my

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,900
starting off points away so

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,779
um as was indicated I'm actually a

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,779
lawyer so you may be wondering what

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,640
exactly I'm doing here because most

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,080
typical lawyers don't really know

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,500
anything about it and I noticed as

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,840
Andreas was speaking I have the proof of

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,540
that because I have Bits of Paper for my

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
speech and he had a laptop so I think

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,579
that points out the difference

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,940
um what I am here to do is

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,379
um tell you about some of the

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,899
consequences I've dealt with as a result

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,600
of data breaches and to actually

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,739
andreas's Point

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,760
um

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,820
in interacting in those situations with

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,060
all the techie Folk there was very much

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,040
a learning curve from their point of

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,100
view as to what I was getting asked and

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,260
also a learning curve for me as to where

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,180
they're coming from how they've set

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,880
things up and all that kind of thing so

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,299
I really think this intersection of

29
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,200
policy and in my particular Focus

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,439
consequences is super important when

31
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,979
you're putting the whole thing together

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,960
um and as Andreas commented on one of

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,759
the questions at the end it's kind of

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,000
you know it's the lawyers here and you

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,579
know the Cs people and the coders here

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,799
and we just need to get a lot closer

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,100
together so the point of this

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,100
talk is is really to sort of run through

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,920
the consequences but also some of the

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,220
reporting requirements to show you how

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,159
kind of what the guys in the trenches

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,200
with the actual sort of coding and

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,939
computers

44
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,759
um what's going to be important so the

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,740
first thing I did when I was asked to do

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,800
this talk was try and figure out like

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,780
what is the difference between cyber

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,760
security and data protection and kind of

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,099
where do they interact

50
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,000
um

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,900
so basically cyber security covers

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,080
safety against cyber attacks and date

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,180
protection covers a set of issues

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,180
related to data storage management and

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,560
access

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,459
the access part of it is largely

57
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,180
um

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,760
about where the cyber security comes in

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,860
because it's unauthorized access that

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,739
cyber security is basically targeted

61
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,120
against

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,760
so cyber security has a stronger focus

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
on protecting the system itself

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,140
and the data protection legislation and

65
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,720
the policies that have to be put in

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,300
place to comply with the legislation are

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,160
all going to be aimed at safeguarding

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,099
personal data which is stored in that

69
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,720
system

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,019
and it's all going to be driven by

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,440
various regulations so you've got HIPAA

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,099
in the US you've got gdpr in Europe and

73
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,080
here in Cayman we've got the data

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,019
protection Acts

75
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,220
so let's start with what data are we

76
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,739
protecting and when you're designing a

77
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,720
system you've obviously got to know what

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,739
is it I'm trying to actually ensure is

79
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,360
is going to be

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,440
um properly protected and what it is is

81
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,920
personal data which is a super wide

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,920
super wide category it's basically

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,879
information about an individual

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
um couldn't really get much wider than

85
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,280
that and to give you some examples it's

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,340
employee files your email histories the

87
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,599
history of the post to your favorite

88
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,959
social network record of your bank

89
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,879
transactions more seriously your medical

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,040
records and also some personal data is

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,299
actually said to be sensitive so that is

92
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,060
actually even more important

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,238
um and the consequences for it getting

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,919
out to the bad guys is even more

95
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,180
important and sensitive data is probably

96
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,220
what you might imagine but it's genetic

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,220
and Health Data information on Race

98
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,560
racial or ethnic Origins political

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,020
opinions religious or similar beliefs

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,540
sex life and commission or alleged

101
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,820
Commission of offenses

102
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,139
so that is what we are protecting

103
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,020
um so what are we protecting it against

104
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,020
um well the goal of data protection is

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,380
to protect the privacy of the

106
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,380
individuals concerned but also strike a

107
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,180
fair balance with the legitimate

108
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,639
interests of the entities who need to

109
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,340
use the personal data

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,199
um and

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,780
there's a lot in the legislation about

112
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,000
the word processing and processing in

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,280
its broadest term is holding data and

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,080
using it in any way that's going to mean

115
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
the data Protection Law applies which is

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,300
a bit kind of circular but

117
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,120
you know just really obtaining recording

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
and holding data is processing it

119
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,560
carrying out any operational set of

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,160
operations on it is processing it

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,900
organizing it adapting it altering it is

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,820
processing it retrieving IT consulting

123
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,639
it or using it is Con is processing it

124
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,460
disclosing is processing it

125
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,600
etc etc so pretty much if you have some

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,740
information on people and you hold it or

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,699
you you know use it to do payroll you

128
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,380
are processing data

129
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,720
so the data protection principles and

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,639
and these data protection principles

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,500
these are the ones that are in the data

132
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,620
protection act in Cayman but they come

133
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,919
out of and are are sort of common with

134
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,560
the European and the UK standards so

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,259
gdpr and now the

136
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,919
um England has left the EU they've got

137
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,960
their own legislation but it's basically

138
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
gdpr and our data protection act was

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
based on

140
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,360
um the UK law before gdpr it's not

141
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,639
massively different the principles are

142
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,780
the same

143
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,060
um there's just just a few little things

144
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,220
that we're talking about so there are

145
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,680
data protection principles are fair and

146
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
lawful use purpose limitation data

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,220
minimization data accuracy storage

148
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,919
limitation respect for the individuals

149
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,500
rights security integrity and

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,660
confidentiality and then International

151
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,520
transfers

152
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,220
you'll be very glad to hear that all

153
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,560
we're going to really focus on today is

154
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
the security integrity and

155
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,020
confidentiality that is obviously

156
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,319
or the most obvious way I should say

157
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,020
that cyber security comes and interacts

158
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,199
with data protection uh legislation and

159
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,860
requirements in any organization and I

160
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,620
should just say that

161
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,560
who has to comply with this is basically

162
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,360
everybody

163
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,880
um and that's governments that's

164
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
organizations that's not for profits

165
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
pretty much the only person who doesn't

166
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
is you on your little home computer

167
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,919
anybody else pretty much you do

168
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,720
um and when I say on your home computer

169
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,319
home computer you know sending emails to

170
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,060
your friends doing things on a personal

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,120
level not working from home

172
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
um

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,800
so

174
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,560
I had to put this slide in because

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,020
um data protection policy this is the

176
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,720
three three monkeys with the See No Evil

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Hear no evil speak no evil and

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,319
um it's kind of kind of a summary of a

179
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,780
data protection policy but obviously

180
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,800
it's going to have to be a little bit

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
more detailed than that

182
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,479
um so looking at

183
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,520
security integrity and confidentiality

184
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,340
principle what is it that you are

185
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,940
actually required to do in terms of

186
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,458
protective measures

187
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,899
um and this one a little goes a little

188
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,419
bit into what Andreas was saying in

189
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,039
terms of you know risk meets

190
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,080
um uh

191
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,899
a sort of ability to comply cost of

192
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,920
compliance Etc and what the legislation

193
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,300
uses is the word appropriate you have to

194
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,180
use appropriate Technical and

195
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,700
organizational measures

196
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,279
um against unauthorized or unlawful

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,360
processing of personal data and against

198
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,220
accidental loss or destruction of or

199
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,279
damage to personal data

200
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,860
so there's a few different aspects to

201
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,680
the principle there's the organizational

202
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,380
measures staff training policy

203
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,420
development there's the technical

204
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,959
measures physical protection of data

205
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,959
I can't say this word

206
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,040
pseudonymization say it slowly

207
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,980
encryption

208
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,860
um and then also securing ongoing

209
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,959
availability

210
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,360
integrity and accessibility you know

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,560
backups that sort of thing so again you

212
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,459
know

213
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,980
cyber security meets data protection

214
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,140
when you come into the technical

215
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,360
measures this there's an element also of

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,279
obviously when you're designing a system

217
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,200
you want it to meet you want to make

218
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,880
sure that what you've got on there is

219
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,360
going to be is going to be kept there in

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
it in the form that it was originally

221
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,620
given to you

222
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,440
um but you know we can't we classically

223
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,560
think of cyber security

224
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,180
um protecting the data from the outside

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,160
so what measures are actually going to

226
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,399
be appropriate

227
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,779
um well you're going to have to review

228
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,839
the personal data you hold the way and

229
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,000
the way you use it and you're going to

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,640
have to assess how valuable sensible

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,100
sensitive or confidential it is now

232
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,440
remember we had that um sensitive

233
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,200
personal data how much of that have you

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,839
got if you are a hospital pretty much

235
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,459
everything's going to be sensitive

236
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,300
personal data if

237
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,880
you are something like a not-for-profit

238
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,519
you may just hold addresses names email

239
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,860
addresses that's personal data but it's

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,620
not necessarily sensitive personal data

241
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,500
so that's going to feed into what are

242
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,260
your appropriate measures that you're

243
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,820
going to be taking

244
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,800
you're going to need to take account of

245
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,980
factors such as the nature and extent of

246
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,380
your organization's premises and

247
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,079
computer systems the number of Staff you

248
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,720
have the extent of their access to

249
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,399
personal data

250
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,860
and

251
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,920
um whether you have anybody that is

252
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,620
actually doing data processing on your

253
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,300
behalf

254
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,279
um there's Concepts in the legislation

255
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,779
which you're not going to go into in any

256
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,339
detail but you've got the data

257
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,620
controller who is really the person who

258
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
originally has the data and then you

259
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,720
have data processing which is anybody

260
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,120
who's actually doing something with the

261
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,240
data in accordance with the slide those

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,480
might be two three or more people the

263
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,519
data controller is actually responsible

264
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,980
for all the data processing even if

265
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,860
that's going on in a third-party vendor

266
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,740
or something like that so what is

267
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,959
appropriate has to take that sort of

268
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,940
thing into account as well as of course

269
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,820
what information you're looking at as

270
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,060
well

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,140
so

272
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,620
what is a data breach

273
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,800
a data breach or a personal data breach

274
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,579
it's a breach of security leading to The

275
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,940
Accidental or unlawful destruction loss

276
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,500
alteration honor authorized disclosure

277
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,959
of or access to personal data

278
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,519
transmitted store to otherwise processed

279
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,980
um now what's interesting about this

280
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,459
again is there are scenarios that you

281
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,139
can think of you know we're all

282
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,120
classically thinking about the hackers

283
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
have come into the system they've stolen

284
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
all the data you know maybe they're

285
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,360
holding you to Ransom otherwise it's all

286
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,760
going up on the Internet something like

287
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,260
that but equally it's the breach if your

288
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,720
backups fail and it's all gone

289
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,139
equally it's a breach if somehow it all

290
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,779
got corrupted and everybody's date of

291
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,720
birth got changed by five years

292
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,579
equally it's a breach if

293
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,800
um you Loft it for a bit but then you

294
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,040
got it back so you know let's let's say

295
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
back up from last week failed but you

296
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,779
managed to go back a month and all that

297
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,480
data was the same you would have lost it

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
for a bit even though you'd actually

299
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,139
managed to restore it all these things

300
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,339
the data breaches

301
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,638
foreign

302
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,560
what's what's going to happen or what

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
what it what do you have to do then so

304
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,019
you've got a duty to report all personal

305
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,100
data breaches to the onwards button and

306
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,779
this is in Cayman the Ombudsman in

307
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,720
Cayman is the

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,360
um regulator for the data protection act

309
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,880
it does other things but um in this

310
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,680
particular

311
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,380
um context he is the person to whom

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,200
reports are made the Ombudsman actually

313
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,660
has a really good website the forms for

314
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,560
reporting are on that website and

315
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,839
um lots of guidance about what you need

316
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,980
to do when you need to do it Etc

317
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,360
um

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,779
but the other thing about this is you

319
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,519
know you might be expecting okay there's

320
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,019
going to be a regulator we're going to

321
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,399
have to report through regulator that

322
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,440
makes sense but actually you've also got

323
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,320
a report to the individual whose data

324
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,639
was breached

325
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,519
and that is often actually the more

326
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,279
sensitive issue for organizations most

327
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,959
people are like hey we report to

328
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
Regulators all the time no no worries

329
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,579
but you mean I've actually got to go out

330
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,519
and tell my best client that I revealed

331
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,440
you know their Bank Account Details to

332
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,139
somebody that's where people go oh do I

333
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,000
really have to do this

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,940
um the other thing about this to know

335
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,360
and this is very important to

336
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,060
communicate to the techie teams you've

337
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,000
got to do this within five days this is

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,940
not five working days this is five days

339
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,160
now one of the interesting things is

340
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,699
Hackers know this so it is not a

341
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,639
coincidence that you tend to get your

342
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,279
you know we've got your data it's all

343
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,860
going on the internet unless you pay us

344
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,199
a gazillion dollars

345
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,240
um on a Friday evening

346
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,300
because they know you know you've got to

347
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,220
scramble you going into the weekend

348
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,959
you've got to call the whole team in

349
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,519
you've got to figure out what the hell's

350
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,100
going on here and you've got to get your

351
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,839
lawyers on board or whoever it is you

352
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,820
use for reporting and you've got to get

353
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,399
all of this done in five days it's

354
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,420
actually worse than some other

355
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,519
jurisdictions because it's 72 hours so

356
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,019
count yourselves lucky and came and

357
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,240
you've got five whole days

358
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,079
um

359
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,660
and there's a lot of stuff you actually

360
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,019
need to know in order to do your

361
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,760
reporting

362
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,260
um you've got to provide the Ombudsman

363
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,959
and the individual

364
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
um with all the information about the

365
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,660
breach

366
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,760
um but also you've got to provide them

367
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,320
with the information about the measures

368
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,300
you've taken and the measures you

369
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,839
recommend any individual to take and

370
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,480
indeed because five days is not normally

371
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,339
long enough to get your arms around the

372
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,380
whole problem the measures that you

373
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,040
intend to take the ongoing addressing

374
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,139
what you've not been able to find out so

375
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,660
far what you will report further when

376
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,160
you will report it

377
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,500
etc etc etc

378
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,940
so all that to say you need robust

379
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,300
detection investigation and internal

380
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,060
reporting procedures in place and this

381
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,279
goes back to

382
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,140
I really think what Andrews was talking

383
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,599
about which is you've got to build that

384
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,720
into your system I think

385
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,919
um if your system isn't geared up and

386
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,780
and the people who design the system

387
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,400
didn't know what you were going to need

388
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,959
to know when you were going to be

389
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,480
reporting is going to be quite difficult

390
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,079
to kind of reverse engineer that in my

391
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,240
experience it's like oh yes we can get

392
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,040
it but it's going to take us 10 days you

393
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
know that's and and you can report that

394
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,419
but

395
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,360
um it's not terribly satisfactory

396
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,600
the things that you have to report when

397
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
you when you fill in the form you've got

398
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,440
to provide a description of the nature

399
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,380
of the personal breach so you know what

400
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,299
is it was it was it lost was it

401
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,580
destruction was it

402
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,400
um unauthorized access those specifics

403
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,160
you've got to provide the descriptions

404
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,700
the consequences of the breach

405
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,580
um has this appeared in public has it

406
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,500
simply gone to

407
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,559
two or three people is it a ransomware

408
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,900
situation

409
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,980
um

410
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,160
the measures you proposed or already

411
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
taken to address the breach so you know

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,820
this is

413
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,860
you know oh we just changed a few

414
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,500
passwords and that's going to do it or

415
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,320
is you know there are a whole bunch of

416
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,360
have you have you had to go and employ

417
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,780
you know detectives and crawl agencies

418
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,820
to try and find you know where the

419
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,280
stuff's gone to and all that kind of

420
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,740
thing so

421
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,620
um there's an awful lot believe me

422
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,620
there's an awful lot to get your arms

423
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,700
around to understand from you know your

424
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,160
technical people and you know what you

425
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,280
have typically in this situation is you

426
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,179
know you see CEO your CIO your lawyers

427
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,000
and a bunch of computer people sitting

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,780
in a room none of them speaking the same

429
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,340
fundamental language all trying to

430
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,260
understand

431
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,840
um you know what's happened how can they

432
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,340
stop it

433
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,039
you know and and what's happened is

434
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,100
often super difficult in itself to

435
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,419
figure out

436
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:26,520
so so yeah that's that's one of I think

437
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,299
you know my major messages really from

438
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,500
my experience is if

439
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,620
you have these conversations before

440
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,780
something happens how are we going to

441
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,160
know this how are we going to know the

442
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,860
other it's just going to be super

443
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,679
helpful when you actually come to the

444
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,220
reporting

445
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,000
there is

446
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,179
there is an exception to reporting

447
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,940
um and it's what I like to call the uh

448
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,299
no harm no foul exception

449
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,460
um and it's it's what's referenced on

450
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,620
the slide here where the breach is

451
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,860
unlikely to Prejudice the individual's

452
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,100
data rights and freedoms

453
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
um that was the seven principles we

454
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,660
talked about earlier

455
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,000
um and then just by way of an example

456
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
one of the things that most commonly

457
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,880
happens which is the data breach is

458
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,940
you send a document

459
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,000
um to the wrong email address or you

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
send an email which includes somebody

461
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,559
who's not really supposed to have got

462
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,080
the email

463
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,799
um

464
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,740
wanna you can reach out if you reach out

465
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,799
to the person who received it and they

466
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,520
can you can get a confirmation that

467
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,500
um they will destroy it they didn't take

468
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,240
any copies

469
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,240
etc etc usually that will fall into the

470
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,960
kind of no harm no foul principle

471
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,320
um that's really common you know I I am

472
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,799
my firms came in data champion and I can

473
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,660
tell you I probably get asked that three

474
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,179
times a week at least

475
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,059
um another example

476
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,799
um is about

477
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,260
um deletions so

478
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,780
the example that I sort of copied out of

479
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,919
somewhere

480
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,260
um the university

481
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,059
experience is a breach

482
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,880
because somebody's accidentally deleted

483
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,780
all the alumni contact details

484
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,760
as I mentioned before the date the the

485
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,400
details are later we created from the

486
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,419
backup

487
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,179
that's actually unlikely to affect any

488
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,000
individual's right to have their data

489
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,240
process fairly to have it minimized to

490
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,120
have it deleted upon requests Etc so

491
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,559
that's the kind of breach that doesn't

492
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,120
need to be reported and believe me this

493
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,280
is not entirely a plug for my profession

494
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,580
but I would say if in doubt do ask

495
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,620
somebody to give you a professional

496
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,919
opinion on it because as we'll come on

497
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,500
to consequences of breach and

498
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,480
consequences of failing to report a

499
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,140
breach even more are are pretty serious

500
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,020
um

501
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,520
so

502
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,640
just quickly I might be sort of teaching

503
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,400
everybody to suck eggs but

504
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,179
um

505
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,860
really we're focused I'm focusing on you

506
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,380
know the malicious data breaches that

507
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,299
are going to re lead to a reporting

508
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,980
requirement I'm not really going to

509
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,260
focus on the no harm no foul I mentioned

510
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,419
it to be complete but that's that's not

511
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,460
really what this is about

512
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,919
you know so and it's because malicious

513
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,440
data breaches mostly result from cyber

514
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,020
attacks hence cyber security to prevent

515
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,299
us from cyber attacks

516
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,760
um and as you probably all know you know

517
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,900
what we're really talking about here is

518
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,120
fishing

519
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,220
um The Brute Force attacks and malware

520
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,320
um and I probably don't really need to

521
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,840
go very much into that with this sort of

522
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,539
audiences to what exactly those things

523
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,460
are

524
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,220
um but essentially trying trying to stop

525
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,440
all of those things happening

526
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,679
is cyber security

527
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,760
unfortunately most people would now tell

528
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
you it's not going to be

529
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,100
if you have a successful Cyber attack

530
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,900
and a data breach it's going to be when

531
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,340
and you need to report that breach nine

532
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,820
and a half if not 9.9 times out of ten

533
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,919
if it's a Cyber attack you're going to

534
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,200
be reporting it it's very hard to come

535
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,580
up with a situation where there's no

536
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,679
harm no foul there

537
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,620
um and as we've said you're gonna need

538
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,539
to do it quickly

539
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,720
and so this is where your security

540
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,640
systems should ensure that they totally

541
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,240
enable that to happen

542
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,140
um

543
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,640
so the last thing I'm going to talk

544
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,200
about is kind of does this really matter

545
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,520
um

546
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,200
so yes on very very very many levels so

547
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,880
we've all

548
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,480
you know had

549
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,179
in the news you know people like

550
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,539
um Uber and Equifax and so forth and

551
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,059
I'll talk about a couple of examples of

552
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,460
fine situations

553
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,720
um at the end

554
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,280
but you know for a business organization

555
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,919
obviously a data breach

556
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,200
um can have devastating effects on the

557
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,960
reputation and on the financial bottom

558
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,280
line I read some statistics that the

559
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,100
average cost of

560
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,520
um just investigating reporting a data

561
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,020
breach

562
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,080
um on any sort of sizable organization

563
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,600
which I think was 100 staff and above is

564
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,640
something in the region of 4.2 million

565
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,720
dollars so it's it's not cheap

566
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,320
um and that must feed into when we were

567
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,659
talking earlier about what is

568
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,100
appropriate

569
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,640
you know your CFO if nobody else is

570
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
going to care that you know all right

571
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,440
you're asking me to spend an extra

572
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
dollar million dollars this year on

573
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
their system you know

574
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
um if anybody's giving you pushback you

575
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,140
know wave some of those costs of reach

576
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,200
statistics in the in their face

577
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,279
um

578
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,900
for government organizations obviously

579
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,240
compromise data can mean exposing highly

580
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,360
confidential information to to foreign

581
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,200
parties and and very very bad actors

582
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,340
and for individuals identity theft is is

583
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,020
a huge problem for them and

584
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,620
um

585
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,740
you know we've all sort of heard of the

586
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,900
dark web and everything that's going on

587
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,320
on the dark web and you know

588
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,779
um the sale of data on the dark web you

589
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,640
know this this all goes beyond and is

590
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,460
much more serious than you know Facebook

591
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,159
harvesting your likes to sell to

592
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,059
advertisers

593
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,659
um so failing to notify a breach when

594
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,720
you're required to do so under the data

595
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,820
protection act in Cayman is a criminal

596
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,960
offense

597
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,900
and it can result in a convection and a

598
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
fine of one hundred thousand dollars

599
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
um I will say that in Cayman the

600
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,940
monetary penalties are probably the

601
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,159
least of your problems unlike in some

602
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,380
other jurisdictions

603
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,059
um and failing to notify can also be the

604
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,700
subject of a monetary penalty imposed by

605
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,419
the

606
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,740
Ombudsman of up to a quarter of a

607
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,059
million dollars and that would be on top

608
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,159
of the fines

609
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:08,940
um

610
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
the other thing to bear in mind here is

611
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,200
that in some instances the officers of a

612
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,480
company which has failed to notify a

613
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,400
breach can be personally liable to be

614
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,220
criminally convicted now that is going

615
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,679
to really mess with your life

616
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,679
um so you know these are very serious

617
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,480
consequences

618
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,919
the flip side of that is that reporting

619
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,860
a breach is not necessarily going to

620
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,820
lead you to any consequences at all if

621
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,799
you know as we said

622
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,760
reaches are not if they win if you have

623
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
taken appropriate measures to guard

624
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,360
against the breach and you have taken

625
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,380
you know measures to address the breach

626
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,440
and address the individual harm the

627
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,419
Ombudsman may be perfectly satisfied

628
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,240
with your response and also your

629
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,480
original systems I may go thank you for

630
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,740
reporting you know stuff happens

631
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,140
move on or they may come back with a few

632
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,880
recommendations but they're not

633
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,279
necessarily going to try and send you to

634
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,860
jail try and make you pay them loads of

635
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,179
money

636
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,400
um if you don't report when you should

637
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,740
have reported that will almost

638
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,179
inevitably happen

639
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,179
um

640
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,640
and you know I've I'm obviously in

641
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,039
Cayman I'm advising on Cayman data

642
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,400
breaches but a lot of times these are

643
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,799
internet have an international impact

644
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,659
and

645
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,360
certainly the financial potential

646
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,440
consequences in the US and the EU are

647
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,799
much much bigger for instance the

648
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,960
general data protection regulation gdpr

649
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,039
which is what um prevails in Europe

650
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,600
provides that where an organization is

651
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,539
committed a data breach the regulatory

652
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,419
body can impose an administrative fine

653
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,860
of up to 10 million Euros or up to two

654
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,880
percent of a company's worldwide annual

655
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,760
turnover of the preceding Financial year

656
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,260
whichever is higher so if your meta or

657
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,260
somebody like that that is an awful lot

658
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,140
of money

659
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,580
so I said I was just going to

660
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,980
um run you through a few scary examples

661
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,820
um and my my favorite is actually

662
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,700
Equifax because it's in a sense you know

663
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,340
in the worst possible sense

664
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,120
um the gift that keeps on giving so cast

665
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,320
your mind back to 2017 which is when

666
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,419
Equifax lost the personal and financial

667
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,620
information of about 150 million people

668
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,860
not a small data breach

669
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,299
um and that happened because of

670
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,039
um and I quote because I know I have no

671
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
idea what this means unpatched Apache

672
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,700
struts framework in one of its databases

673
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,159
um they actually failed to fix the

674
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,860
critical vulnerability months after the

675
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,419
Patch had been issued

676
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,940
and then they failed to inform the

677
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,640
public at the breach for weeks after it

678
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,840
was discovered so pretty much as bad as

679
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
it gets

680
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,179
um

681
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,700
you know they they knew there was a fix

682
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,580
they hadn't applied the fix to enhance

683
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,460
the security and then they did not

684
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,679
report and they did not reach out to the

685
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,320
individuals I mean can you imagine you

686
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,840
know how this is all your credit

687
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
information you know that's been out

688
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,220
there for weeks how damaging that could

689
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,000
be

690
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
so

691
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,679
in July 2019 they agreed to pay a 575

692
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,399
million dollar fine which had the

693
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,220
potential to raise rise to 700 million

694
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,960
dollars

695
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,840
um and that was in a settlement with the

696
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,419
U.S Federal Trade Commission Consumer

697
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,440
Financial Protection Bureau and all 50

698
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,539
United States and territories in in the

699
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,179
United States of America

700
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,820
um they'd already paid

701
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,919
uh us 625

702
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,059
000 in the UK for the breach

703
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,000
um and that at that time was the maximum

704
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,980
fine that could be levied as I've just

705
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,039
told you gdpr is really upped the ante

706
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,220
on that so if this happened today that

707
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,220
would have been a lot more money

708
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,020
doesn't end there in 2020 Equifax was

709
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,299
made to pay further settlements relating

710
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,860
to the breach of uh 7.75 million plus 2

711
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,500
million in legal fees to financial

712
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,340
institutions in the United States

713
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,200
and

714
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,760
18.2 million to the state of

715
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,600
Massachusetts and 19.5 million to the

716
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,960
state of Indiana

717
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,580
um so yeah all in that probably did come

718
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,600
to somewhere around 600 million for that

719
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,919
breach

720
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,260
um and there's still a few lawsuits

721
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,159
ongoing so it may not end there and the

722
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,580
reason I like this as an example is not

723
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,700
only because you know the the facts of

724
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,720
the example are pretty egregious

725
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,700
um but

726
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,600
it really demonstrates how this isn't a

727
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,360
kind of one and done you know this will

728
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,240
roll on and you know I mean if they were

729
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,399
paying 2 million in legal costs one of

730
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,440
the people that they settled with only

731
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,539
imagine what their legal costs are and

732
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,519
only imagine what their administrative

733
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,899
costs are

734
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:20,120
so you know it really is an absolutely

735
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,980
huge thing

736
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,080
um I think I'll just you know touch on

737
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,179
another one

738
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,380
um

739
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,760
and this is more recent so this is

740
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,000
January 2022 and it was

741
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,899
um

742
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,299
Morgan Stanley

743
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,659
um and this was what was about

744
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,700
interesting about this is this is

745
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,460
actually more focused on

746
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,480
um the Civil side of things so

747
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
um

748
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,760
they've been they've paid already

749
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,799
a 60 million

750
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,799
um penalty to the office of the

751
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,339
controller Comptroller of currency

752
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,320
um

753
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,659
and what they failed to do was exercise

754
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,739
Pro proper oversight of the 2016

755
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,060
decommissioning of two wealth management

756
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,980
business Data Centers located in the US

757
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,540
they felt effectively assess or address

758
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,760
risks associated with decommissioning

759
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,099
the hardware they also adequately assess

760
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,659
the risk of subcontracting the

761
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,359
decommissioning work and so remember I

762
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,980
said you're responsible for your third

763
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,980
parties too so they they'd farm this out

764
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,679
somebody had messed it up it was Morgan

765
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,619
Stanley who ended up paying the fine

766
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,000
um and they did not adequate and expose

767
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,040
adequate due diligence in selecting the

768
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,379
vendor they didn't monitor their

769
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,719
performance and they failed to maintain

770
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,780
an appropriate inventory of the data

771
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,339
that had been stored on the

772
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,839
decommissioned

773
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,599
um Hardware devices

774
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,180
um that had happened in 2016 it then

775
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,980
managed they managed to repeat it all in

776
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,540
2019.

777
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,400
um

778
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,619
so but then so they've dealt with The

779
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,260
Regulators they've paid Their fines but

780
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,839
then this being America of course out of

781
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,880
the woodwork comes the class action

782
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,220
claim for all of the individuals who are

783
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,500
affected by this

784
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,820
um and essentially long story short

785
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,040
um that was another 60 million dollars

786
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,579
to settle that particular piece of

787
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,940
legislation litigation

788
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,060
um

789
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,300
and Morgan Stanley's public statement on

790
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,820
all this we have previously notified or

791
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,800
potentially impacted clients regarding

792
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,660
these matters which occurred several

793
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,400
years ago and we are pleased to be

794
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,220
resolving this related litigation no

795
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,520


796
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,200
so that is pretty much what I wanted to

797
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
say today

798
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
um I think we've got some time for

799
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,359
questions

800
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,810
um but thank you very much for listening

801
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:18,429
[Applause]

802
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,480
oh silence I like silence

803
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,000
oh and there's hands up at the back too

804
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,339
uh hi there thank you very much for the

805
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,760
presentation can you confirm that Cayman

806
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,820
Islands law firms that house kyc data

807
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,440
uh are subject to reporting to the

808
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,700
ombudsman

809
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,180
yes I mean well reporting if there's a

810
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,060
breach yeah you don't I mean there's no

811
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,220
there's no registration process or

812
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,260
anything like that you don't have to go

813
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,500
oh I'm holding data please make a note

814
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,680
um but yes if you your a law firm as an

815
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,060
organization

816
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,640
kyc is personal data some of it may well

817
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,500
be sensitive personal data probably is

818
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
if it's a passport or something like

819
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,240
that if there is a data breach and

820
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,760
somehow that information is lost

821
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
destroyed

822
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,740
on authorized access you absolutely have

823
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,359
to report that breach

824
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,420
and do you have any examples of any

825
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,720
Ombudsman fines in Cayman

826
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,560
so the data protection act in Cayman

827
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,940
um came into force in 2019 and

828
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,900
um

829
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,800
the and obviously in 2020 we all had

830
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,960
covered and working from home and all

831
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,660
this kind of thing so the Ombudsman has

832
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,079
been more in education mode than

833
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,619
enforcement mode but they are now in

834
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,800
enforcement mode so to date there has

835
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,380
not been a lot of history of

836
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,720
prosecutions and fines there's been a

837
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,520
lot of work going on with the Ombudsman

838
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,280
in terms of ensuring people are aware

839
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,920
the Ombudsman now feels like you should

840
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,480
all be aware and so moving forward I

841
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,740
don't think there's going to be any

842
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,280
level of Tolerance that you don't know

843
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,320
what you were supposed to do when you

844
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,060
were supposed to do it or how you were

845
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,000
supposed to do it thank you

846
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,180
foreign

847
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,160
yeah so you spoke a lot about the arms

848
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,820
budsman um do you have any experience or

849
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,520
have you seen cases with SEMA as it

850
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,160
relates to cyber security breaches so I

851
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,140
know the Ombudsman would be the

852
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,440
regulator for data breaches but SEMA for

853
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,079
regulated entities and

854
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,119
um SEMA has been very vocal that this

855
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,920
year they're going to be focusing on

856
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,260
cyber security in their Prudential

857
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,839
inspections what have you seen heard or

858
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,140
have you seen cases where uh SEMA has

859
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,839
made findings and and in that nature

860
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,880
just curious to know

861
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,720
I haven't seen much of that yet and

862
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,280
um

863
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,560
it is as you say something that they

864
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,079
have announced over the last year that

865
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,839
they are going to focus on

866
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,619
um

867
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,839
I think frankly they've had their hands

868
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,280
full focusing on kyc and trying to you

869
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,079
know get themselves off

870
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,060
um up to speed so we can get off various

871
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,380
lists

872
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,200
um so I think it's early days on that I

873
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,140
only have a couple of anecdotal

874
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,220
um sort of feedbacks if you like from

875
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,140
um people I know who've been through a

876
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,440
regular steamer inspection and all they

877
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,180
were really asked to do was you know do

878
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,700
you have a cyber security policy can you

879
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,180
give it to us and so forth and so on so

880
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,480
I don't think it's got much past that at

881
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,020
this stage but you're absolutely right

882
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,180
that's going to be coming up on sema's

883
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,240
radar and I mean that's an entirely

884
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,060
separate thing to data protection data

885
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,060
protection breaches but yeah it's going

886
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,980
to be watch this space and you might

887
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,320
find yourself and it and I think it's

888
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,820
also it's it's going to be different

889
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,599
criteria as far as I read yeah so you're

890
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,160
going to have to find yourself going

891
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,220
again you know within five days I need

892
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,440
to know what happened I I need to figure

893
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,119
out if I need to report here I need to

894
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,640
figure out if I need to report here and

895
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm sure there will be more things to

896
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,180
think about as well thank you

897
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,800
did you did you want the microphone

898
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,060
okay so um I'm from Jamaica

899
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,380
we're actually going through an exercise

900
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,599
right now because our data protection

901
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,359
Act was passed in 2020 and I'm going to

902
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,680
be

903
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,380
um implemented or I should say enforced

904
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,579
December uh 2023 you know people will

905
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,800
have to get data privacy offices and

906
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,859
right and other compliance measures but

907
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,020
I I'm going back to one of the slides

908
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,900
which you said where a report would have

909
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,760
to be made to the Ombudsman if there was

910
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,820
uh

911
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,740
a breach that actually that actually

912
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,720
like endangered people not like you know

913
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,560
he's in a accident

914
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,859
but it it it it

915
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,760
occurs to me

916
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,560
that

917
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,260
maybe I don't know what the situation

918
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,000
this thing came on but I can tell you

919
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,420
like in Jamaica there

920
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,960
we it should be a material difference

921
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,020
between breaches by government or large

922
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,280
organizations rather versus those by

923
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,859
small ones uh I'll give you an example

924
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,800
for instance we had our Jam kovid which

925
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,760
was exposed on an Amazon S3 bucket for

926
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,260
the world to see for a pii we had a

927
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,060
conglomerate that had um

928
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,880
again got locked by ransomware and

929
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,579
nobody knew until somebody dropped it on

930
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:18,720
LinkedIn

931
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,560
as such and no notifications to anybody

932
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,500
to anybody and yes these are large

933
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,839
organizations a lot of information or

934
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,200
for the small business business person

935
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,339
as such

936
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,420
um

937
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,020
in human are there different ways of for

938
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,339
instance maybe for breaches between more

939
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,240
in an in an education mode or or in an

940
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,880
assistive mode rather than an insistive

941
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,500
punitive mode

942
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,140
for those people because you know

943
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,880
for instance if I was in Jamaica is four

944
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,980
percent of your of your earnings I don't

945
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,599
know what it is in Cayman but it's great

946
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,780
I'm assuming it is of similar size

947
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,319
well and to your question I mean it all

948
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,200
that all feeds into the word appropriate

949
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,079
so so let's see if I can make this thing

950
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,560
go back

951
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,319
okay so the key word for large

952
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,579
organization versus small organization

953
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:26,700
is what measures are appropriate and

954
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,420
that that is where this you may not be

955
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,380
held to the same standard if you know

956
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,740
you're a small company and you know a

957
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,099
bunch of people's emails somehow are are

958
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:42,839
hacked doesn't mean you don't have to

959
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,520
report you're definitely going to have

960
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,619
to report but when the Ombudsman

961
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,500
assesses whether your measures to

962
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,540
protect that information were

963
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,880
appropriate you know they will take into

964
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,079
account size resources those sorts of

965
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,640
things

966
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,500
um and as you rightly point out you know

967
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,880
if you are a large multinational

968
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,640
organization with a branch in Cayman or

969
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,839
or

970
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,480
um Jamaica whatever you know you the

971
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,220
measures that are going to have the

972
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,900
Ombudsman or your record calculator is

973
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,880
going to think would be if if your

974
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,819
legislation is the same appropriate are

975
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,180
going to be a lot higher and you know

976
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,900
but that that's the only

977
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,119
get out if you like

978
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,220
um and it's a risk-based analysis I mean

979
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,900
I know we all hate risk-based analysis

980
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,940
because we do it with kyc and AML and

981
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,680
all this thing and it's always like okay

982
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,599
well we did our risk-based analysis and

983
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,040
then somebody comes along and tells you

984
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,680
that your risk-based analysis was wrong

985
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,060
um but that's all you can do you you

986
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,760
there's a there's and I mean I I don't

987
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,780
know what resources you have but

988
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,000
um if the legislation as it probably

989
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,220
does has the same

990
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,680
um eight principles I would thoroughly

991
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,440
recommend the Cayman ombudsman's website

992
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,920
and the guides on it for what to think

993
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,920
about and you know particularly in in

994
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,680
you know the um seventh principle the

995
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,099
security and integrity mode you know how

996
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:19,260
to go about your risk what factors to

997
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,599
take into account and that that's where

998
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,440
you just get that measure of you know

999
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,760
can we hold you know the the one-man

1000
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,300
band to the same standard as Google

1001
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,000
right so I can tell you the principles

1002
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
are basically the same

1003
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,859
problem that's a lot of confusion in

1004
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,599
Jamaica is because we have the law

1005
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,180
but we really don't have the regulations

1006
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,680
right like how they're supposed to be

1007
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,740
you know interpreted so that's where our

1008
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,400
issue is right and you know obviously

1009
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,000
you're not going to be able to 100 rely

1010
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,359
on anything that's come out of you know

1011
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:04,020
the UK or Europe or or Cayman in terms

1012
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,560
of guidance or so forth but if you are

1013
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,960
an organization trying to comply in

1014
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,680
Jamaica at the moment at least if what

1015
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,640
you had an issue and you said well hey

1016
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,500
we had the legislation but we had

1017
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,420
nothing else to go by so what we looked

1018
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,180
at was these other sources which all

1019
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,460
have the same Concepts as our

1020
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,740
legislation in order to carry out our

1021
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,640
risk-based analysis you're going to have

1022
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,740
a conversation with your regulator

1023
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,598
that's going to make some kind of sense

1024
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,140
I think we may be uncannily on time

1025
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,220
thank you everybody

1026
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,620
[Applause]
