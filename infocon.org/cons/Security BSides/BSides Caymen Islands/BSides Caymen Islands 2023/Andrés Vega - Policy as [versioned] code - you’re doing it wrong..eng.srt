around this very pressing set of topics

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,260
and bringing people together in order to

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,020

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,300
that was a very long intro thanks Jane

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm sorry for putting all those words in

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,820
there

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,719
um

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,820
this is me I comment and multiple

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,120
configurations of hair and beard that

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,100
shift quite a bit it's all the same

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
person uh I work at control plane uh

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,379
that is a security consultancy focused

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,039
primarily on highly regulated Industries

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,960
critical National infrastructure and

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,920
financial services uh we do a lot of

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
offensive Security in order to to help

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,439
strengthen defense trying to apply

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,619
combining red teaming to purple teaming

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,759
also we do a lot of audit and assurance

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,720
uh it has been almost a compulsion of

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,600
mine and in recent years helping

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,700
organizations

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,240
rethink holistically about how to meet

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,759
their compliance and Regulatory

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,020
objectives

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,700
through code

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,640
and what what is compliance ultimately

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,759
it's are are we doing what we said we

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,079
will do

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,680
but how many how many screenshots of

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,899
spreadsheets can you provide to

39
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,060
demonstrate that there's got to be a

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,659
better way sure we've started to express

41
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,399
policy as code

42
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,100
and there's uh plenty of room to iterate

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,780
and

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,259
be the best version of the organization

45
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,160
help metabolize the consumption of

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,040
platforms applications products in order

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,620
to provide better services do so

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,400
securely avoid getting reached

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
some of the public works I've I've

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,080
written uh I'd encourage you to to check

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
out some of this references uh one is

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,660
the supply chain best practices guide a

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,360
lot of uh policy in there defining

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,560
policy in order to protect the supply

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,780
chain the software supply chain from

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,300
incidents like the solarwinds breach of

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,140
recent years and other high profiles

58
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,040
profile attacks of that sort also

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
complementary to that the software

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,180
Factory reference architecture it's a

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,180
opinionated

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,360
approach to

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,239
ensuring that supply chain controls are

64
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,000
in place using best of breed the most

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,099
mature the most feature complete open

66
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,780
source projects that are that are out

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,140
out there uh also quite interesting to

68
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,959
to the track if if you follow devops you

69
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,819
might have seen the definitive book The

70
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,200
Phoenix project

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,540
uh recently gathered with another set of

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,659
authors to do a sequel to the book so is

73
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,060
it a novel a little business erotica may

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,400
not be for for everyone but it's the

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
story of a financial services

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,319
organization

77
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,500
receiving a matter requires attention

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,180
from the office of controller of

79
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,440
currency in the United States and

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,420
what unfolds from there how do they

81
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,400
react and how do they manage to bring

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,379
the organization together different

83
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,620
groups have been operating as silos uh

84
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,400
attempting to do deaf secops but also

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
ensuring that compliance and audit get

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
brought along the way as opposed to

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,340
being a adversarial set of Gatekeepers

88
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,099
ensuring that they can all fulfill their

89
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,019
their compliance objectives

90
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,599
uh real quick in the company once again

91
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,720
I I talked about it glossed over it

92
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
we're a security Specialists on cloud

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
kubernetes containers and open source

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,919
clients once again organizations and

95
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,440
highly regulated Industries uh we're a

96
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
relatively small company or 50 people

97
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,759
we're headquartered in London and we

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,419
have offices in New York and Oakland

99
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,280
so

100
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,699
uh the the author the author of The Talk

101
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,139
I'm actually delivering this talk on

102
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,240
behalf someone else gentlemen if by the

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,940
name of Chris Nesbitt Smith Chris works

104
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,820
for the UK Crown prosecution service a

105
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,919
lot of the art a lot of a lot of the

106
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
slides you're going to see where uh

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,300
produced by him

108
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,020
and uh when when we got together and

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,120
we're going over the material we landed

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,220
at okay policy

111
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,880
is actually quite a dolphin

112
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,699
how do we make this compelling how do we

113
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,840
make it interesting so I'll bear with me

114
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,060
I'll try my best to to get your

115
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
attention

116
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,940
um

117
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,460
Chris hired an artist uh for the

118
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,960
following Act

119
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,199
and this is Chris this is not me

120
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,240
uh we have a little contention of

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,720
whether call is a lift or an elevator

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,820
yes we call them elevators not not left

123
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,360
in in North America so Chris walks into

124
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,940
the elevator and people follow right

125
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,120
behind him and he he thinks okay Chris

126
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,539
this is your moment Now or Never as a

127
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,699
door closes he positions himself at the

128
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,639
door he's got a captive audience they're

129
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
his he takes a breath

130
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,400
he looks to the first person on his left

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,220
that person's in a suit they look very

132
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,820
important he gestures had them

133
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,979
they look back to us to say

134
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,740
sure Chris go on

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,000
oh

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,860
you must be the CIO

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,160
the policy maker the one whose neck is

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,419
on the Block

139
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,639
what are the chances of finding you in

140
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,400
my imaginary elevator today

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,819
and Chris asks her so what's keeping you

142
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,900
up at night

143
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,639
and she says

144
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,960
I don't know what teams are really doing

145
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,199
what volume of risk can I take

146
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,340
and what should I show more interest on

147
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,460
setting and changing policies is slow on

148
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,440
hard to communicate

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,680
people just go off do their own thing

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,479
they think they know better

151
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,060
and to be honest they often do

152
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,460
but I'm left playing catch up with the

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,699
rest they've signed me up to okay

154
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,979
I'm not going to be a patronizing snake

155
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,699
or salesman but I can help

156
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,740
managing risk

157
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,259
mostly opportunity risk the fear of

158
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,539
missing out so getting features out the

159
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,500
door avoid getting bogged down on

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,840
everyone like looks back at the at the

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
CIO

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
as as she goes on bureaucracy that's the

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,979
the sign to Slow Me Down

164
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,258
okay great this this is your lucky day

165
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,599
he turns on to the to the next person

166
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,539
they're dressed in overalls as a head

167
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,840
part of town could be could be Brooklyn

168
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,780
could be Posh pardon and and London

169
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,900
shortage they could be the CTO he thinks

170
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,740
before he addresses them they

171
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,960
immediately turn to him

172
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,199
and say hi I am the maintenance person

173
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,280
here

174
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,580
and Chris is like wait how come you're

175
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,860
in my imagination right now hang tight

176
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,300
I'll get back to you straight away

177
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,819
his attention goes to the next person

178
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,560
they're wearing hoodie got their

179
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,319
headphones on around their neck and he's

180
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,860
like right stereotypical developer I

181
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,699
know you very well

182
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,740
so he asks what code do do you write

183
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,979
is it python

184
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,039
and they go cool you got you got

185
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
everything updated to work with uh

186
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,799
perhaps if you do python python 3 that

187
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,020
must be really hard they don't know it

188
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,520
yet but

189
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
he built reporter with them he's

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,399
connected

191
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,820
and they they say yeah like staying hard

192
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,100
on on patching dependencies staying on

193
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,440
top of it so we can always react to the

194
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,860
next fire knowing what rules exist which

195
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,300
ones can I bend

196
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,760
which ones can I break

197
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,880
what might cost me to lose my job

198
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,399
it's it's a struggle to write consistent

199
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,160
good quality code avoiding technical

200
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,279
debt and the rest of my team to follow

201
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,180
along and work cohesively as one

202
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,240
so hey do you use any tools that I can

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,940
help you with Chris asks and they say

204
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,560
yeah for sure lenters code quality test

205
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,839
coverage tools the usual

206
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,839
great I write code two let's be friends

207
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
hand them a printed QR code with a

208
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,899
public dpd keys so they know they can

209
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,540
trust the communications and what Chris

210
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,600
says and he he brings the focus back to

211
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,060
the cleaner it's like okay I got it I

212
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,620
know what you're doing here

213
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
like you get told what to do and when it

214
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,740
changes how does that happen oh we get a

215
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,560
memo something stuck on the wall just

216
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,779
like last week we got one saying that

217
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,180
all white boards and all meeting rooms

218
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,060
needed to be cleaned every night

219
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,060
okay how does that work out

220
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,700
well it's up to us to maintain the new

221
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,459
the new to-do list so we can onboard new

222
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,560
people on the cleaning team

223
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,660
does that ever go wrong

224
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,740
yeah sometimes when we compile our

225
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,279
operational manual we miss a memo

226
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,220
or don't apply it in the right sequence

227
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220
and we get things wrong wrong so

228
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,839
glassing over

229
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,880
at the person who seems to be the

230
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,880
product manager and the Clean Air goes

231
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,820
on to say well like when we had an

232
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,680
updated the guide that the meeting room

233
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,080
on the third floor was being used as a

234
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,060
dedicated war room

235
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,600
and we wiped all the whiteboards

236
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,880
getting back at the developer

237
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,120
they seems to sound familiar to them so

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,880
they're nodding like turns outward not

239
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,100
all special snowflakes the way we go on

240
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,899
about things

241
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,380
but not All Is Lost like good reason

242
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,760
that the person has started whether

243
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,120
they're the lift's starting to slow down

244
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,000
almost arriving at its destination it's

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,820
like okay I may have a silver bullet for

246
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,180
for you all and the CIO looks back ready

247
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
to buy whatever that Chris is selling

248
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,579
and as the doors open is like but wait

249
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,959
who are you

250
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,220
and as he moves out to not stand in the

251
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,740
way not not a obstructing people into

252
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,920
into the office it's like well I'm

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,500
really here just to fix the lift people

254
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
have been complaining it only goes to

255
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,300
the top floor no matter what bottom they

256
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
push and it's actually pretty slow

257
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,600
and they're all like what they storm out

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
it's Furious they head towards the

259
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,579
stairs the door shots

260
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,579
and he carries on goes back to his job

261
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,000
so that act does that does that sound

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,519
familiar to you in any way and if you

263
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,260
can relate to any of them

264
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,779
we may have some answers to you for you

265
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,600
so what if I could say you could update

266
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,959
policy easily even even releasing

267
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,660
several versions not just in one year or

268
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
a month what about 10 updates to the

269
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,240
policy a day and seamlessly communicate

270
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,640
what people need to consume without

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,800
derailing them how to best operate

272
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,160
safely how to attain that promise of the

273
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,860
cloud of developer productivity

274
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,620
operational efficiency without being

275
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,440
bogged down by by audit

276
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,260
you could have visibility on all the

277
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,060
compliance tools that the organization

278
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,620
uses

279
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,200
and that that policy would be readily

280
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
consumable easy to parse you'd be able

281
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,180
to demonstrate compliance

282
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,079
make sense and not be bogged down about

283
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,839
bureaucracy at time of change when it

284
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,180
needs to be and not get in the way

285
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,820
that same policy could be used by

286
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,279
developers as a dependency and operate

287
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,860
like a linter so you can run compliance

288
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,320
checks locally in your continuous

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,019
integration Pipeline on guard protection

290
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,660
ultimately that multiple versions of

291
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,000
that policy as dependencies are

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,779
supported so when emergencies happen

293
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,360
and you must update now because there's

294
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,899
a security advisory of a new critical

295
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,899
vulnerability think lock4j

296
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,260
and everything must be updated it's not

297
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,899
a fire drill but that act of responding

298
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,680
to the incident is now business as usual

299
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
and it doesn't doesn't cost as much

300
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,800
chaos like okay cool right on all of

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,899
that sounds sounds quite promising

302
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,220
so by show of hands who is with the set

303
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,980
and like written or applied a policy

304
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,060
before

305
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,560
here in the room

306
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,660
okay

307
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,720
who of you have

308
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,300
consciously sought

309
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,120
exemption

310
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
conspicuously bent

311
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,660
broken

312
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,019
circumvented ignored bypassed whatever

313
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,600
that policy was with the best of

314
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,940
intentions

315
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,139
okay

316
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,420
typically I take my phone out and snap a

317
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,579
real picture real quick just to just

318
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,019
erase the stakes

319
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,880
we got your names on your badges we know

320
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,980
who you work for we can send it to your

321
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,560
company so you fell for it thank you

322
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
not going to use that actually and as

323
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,660
you see I didn't take the picture

324
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,300
so where do I see policy going wrong

325
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,199
there's

326
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,300
just just to agree on terminology

327
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,160
because policy means different thanks to

328
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,260
different people here's a commonly

329
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,120
accepted definition

330
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,940
a set of ideas or a plan of what to do

331
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,579
in particular situations that has been

332
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,920
agreed to officially by a group of

333
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,839
people

334
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,320
a business organization a government or

335
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,360
a political party

336
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
that policy usually comes down in two

337
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,680
forms One Security like data at rest for

338
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,740
your platforms has to be encrypted or

339
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,320
all all traffic

340
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,300
before it hits the wire must be

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,940
encrypted at a application layer for

342
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,800
data and motion protection

343
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,040
the other type is consistency such as

344
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,320
code Style

345
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,060
there are other types that that you

346
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,839
could think of but broadly those two

347
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,079
are intended to mitigate risk of some

348
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,040
sort

349
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,079
prevent something bad from happening in

350
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,380
the case of cyber a breach and the case

351
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,399
of

352
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,699
um consistency it's all about people

353
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,160
doing things repeatedly driving down

354
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,980
cost not drifting too far off on their

355
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,500
own way uh

356
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,839
not not going on on uninformed

357
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,100
Adventures

358
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,079
although those two sets no matter

359
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
intentions are typically emotionally LED

360
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,740
and are not really rooted or anchored on

361
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,880
controls and that opens the door to Case

362
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,680
by case exemptions

363
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,139
whatever policy exists

364
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,959
it's hindering

365
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,579
productivity

366
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,760
and we often need to reach out to the

367
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,459
policy stakeholders to approve an

368
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,380
exception for us

369
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,300
every time there's there's a situation

370
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,180
the policy hadn't contemplated a time

371
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,560
that it was written

372
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,040
as a lot like laws of the land

373
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,459
with like case laws make very complex

374
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,339
very broad Rule books

375
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,920
for attorneys to navigate and it's

376
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,899
really hard to measure compliance in

377
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,279
court

378
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,040
it often looks like a thin wedge as you

379
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,860
see in the picture where a precedent

380
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,199
which may have been an uncomfortable

381
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,380
appeal to swallow the first time becomes

382
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,559
very dangerous with others as they start

383
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,839
to expand the scope of that new

384
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,540
precedent which

385
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,819
puts us in a place of asking

386
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,760
as the Cure actually worse than the

387
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,079
disease

388
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,740
are these policy changes and exemptions

389
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,620
and the way that we reason about it

390
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,320
are actually something that gets us into

391
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,020
splitting hairs that gets us frustrated

392
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,360
that make us have a lot of unnecessary

393
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,780
conversations rather than the way that

394
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,000
we described and defined the policy in

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
in the first place

396
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
but if you map that to how developer

397
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,940
teams work this is not how software gets

398
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,059
built at least not typically like the

399
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,799
the way that people go from Gathering

400
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,440
requirements turning those client

401
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,280
requirements to a functional spec

402
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,640
and to a set of engineering tasks to

403
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,520
execute against it's very different to

404
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,679
how we've described about policy changes

405
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,740
getting made so why don't we take some

406
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,039
of the best elements of agile devops

407
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,799
pick your modern software and

408
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,039
development methodology and framework

409
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,260
how about we marry those two a little

410
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,400
bit

411
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,580
we've codified everything else up to

412
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,900
date already

413
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,960
so if that isn't the answer of

414
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,179
expressing policies code

415
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,539
then what would it be so in part it is

416
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,000
the point of the talk that we started to

417
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
do that somewhat but perhaps the best

418
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,820
approach is Cargo coating a lot of the

419
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,580
thinking of of policy and we may be

420
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
doing it wrong

421
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
you can thank your favorite product name

422
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,080
Scream it at me as the solution and yes

423
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,820
there's there's a lot of tooling out

424
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,700
there that can help the organization

425
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,100
start to solve the problem to certain

426
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,520
degree and like you're not wrong but the

427
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,320
devil is in the details here

428
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,559
throwing some curly braces around the

429
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,760
statement

430
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,400
doesn't inherently fix things

431
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,520
just making the policy code is not is

432
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,919
not the Silver Bullet

433
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,500
if it is a security control

434
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,220
that we're defining as often

435
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,700
ideal to keep that policy we just wrote

436
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,020
as a secret

437
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,140
exposing it or sharing it is something

438
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,760
that could get in the hands of a

439
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,299
competitor or Worse an adversary that

440
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,179
can turn around use it against you

441
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,760
and we talk we hear a lot in recent

442
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,179
times around shifting security left

443
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,539
but it doesn't it doesn't really support

444
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,799
that Ed results and developers who are

445
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,679
having to already think about

446
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,440
performance availability they now need

447
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,480
to be Security Experts and policy

448
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,919
experts at the time

449
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,220
and they look at a policy and they do

450
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,320
their their best at reverse engineering

451
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,980
that to map it to security to the

452
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,559
engineering requirements and they they

453
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,200
bang their heads of like it wouldn't

454
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,940
take a lot of imagination to find in

455
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
that scenario of deploying an

456
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,799
application and finding Midway that one

457
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,840
of the resources you need it one of the

458
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,140
resources is specified by the policy is

459
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,460
non-compliant

460
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,559
so as you're rolling out this new

461
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,539
application whatever organization you

462
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,700
work with be and it's the first time

463
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,100
it's going to Market or it's an update

464
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,460
if that deploy of that rollout of that

465
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,059
application one of the criteria of the

466
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,640
policy is not mad

467
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,120
it blocks the deployment which leaves

468
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,740
things in an overall state of

469
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,419
inconsistency

470
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,940
halfway which will result in downtime

471
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,799
which will result on the graded

472
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,360
experience

473
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,179
and is it better to be compliant or is

474
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,500
it better to be

475
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,380
not operational sure we can abide by the

476
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,460
policy

477
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,460
we ensure if if this had certain number

478
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,080
of vulnerabilities it doesn't reach

479
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,980
production

480
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,500
but wouldn't it have been better for it

481
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,020
to reach production and some somehow

482
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,679
gets sandboxed or guard railed

483
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,840
understanding that exemption as it was

484
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,640
actively patched

485
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,700
so Engineers are are quite clever and

486
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,720
they're always going to find a way

487
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,240
around they're gonna above through

488
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,520
through the side

489
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,400
every time that a computer says no you

490
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
cannot come through this way

491
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,059
and that's further exasperated when

492
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,580
updates to policy are desired like maybe

493
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,799
you're getting a penetration testing and

494
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,020
something goes wrong and you form this

495
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,200
new policy and could be Amazon web

496
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,900
services all your S3 buckets need to be

497
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,039
encrypted

498
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,020
and that could be considered a breaking

499
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,280
change

500
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,039
and you could say well sure why did we

501
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,500
just provide warnings at least like a

502
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,340
heads up instead of gating it at least

503
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,280
for the less important issues or new

504
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,100
emerging policies as those changes

505
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,299
happen

506
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,640
but that it will only work if everyone

507
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,799
actually looks at it it's not just

508
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,500
writing the document but if folks just

509
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,260
are on about their job every day

510
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,500
we go back to the elevator situation how

511
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,720
do they keep that rule book updated how

512
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,700
they even like load it and their heads

513
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,159
is almost a full-time job of keeping up

514
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,400
with this set of warnings so if you've

515
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,659
adopted devops and chances are

516
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,700
if you're on that Journey you may have

517
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,280
heard the term get Ops or at least like

518
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,159
continuous integration and continuous

519
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,720
delivery

520
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,700
is anyone actually looking at the

521
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,140
warnings

522
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,799
who studies the results of of the logs

523
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,140
every time they're so deploy or every

524
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,299
time there's a build

525
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,400
anyone

526
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,620
not really

527
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,620
if you are you could be missing the

528
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,440
point of CI CD

529
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,620
which is being able to trust

530
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,820
the status and the activity but not here

531
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,640
to throw stones today like going back to

532
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,240
to the promises to the imaginary friends

533
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,780
of what the promised land may look like

534
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,580
EC would mean visible

535
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,100
it has to be communicated it has to be

536
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,940
easily consumable testable updatable and

537
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,419
measurable

538
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,179
nothing really new Under the Sun but

539
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,679
someone has unwittingly solved this

540
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,480
problems elsewhere we just need to

541
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,580
remind them and connect the different

542
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,900
domains

543
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,480
the first thing to start off if you're

544
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,580
doing policies code is putting it in

545
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,460
Version Control get or get help

546
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,960
and then

547
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
from there making that visible to

548
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,600
everyone so the term inner source

549
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,179
how do we bring that institutional

550
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,059
knowledge and capture it

551
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,940
and operationalize it and allowing

552
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,679
anyone within the organization's World

553
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,100
Gardens employees suppliers to see that

554
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,860
policy in that Repository

555
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,620
and is not giving visibility of all the

556
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,360
threat monitoring rules or the

557
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
intelligence away to them you can keep

558
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,340
those to yourself but making the policy

559
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,799
visible as code

560
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,080
and artifacts are and Version Control

561
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,080
and what gaps are there is often better

562
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,059
than the downtime the reverse

563
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,340
engineering walkarounds or the opaque

564
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,500
Legacy solutions that look like a

565
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,419
spaghetti soup

566
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,760
if you're really Brave you may want to

567
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
share it with the outside world you will

568
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,919
find that it finds the ability to work

569
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
well with prospective suppliers and new

570
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,600
business relationships

571
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,679
without incurring in ndas and whatnot uh

572
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,200
widely distributed sick secrets are

573
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
ultimately very expensive to maintain

574
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,120
difficult to handle and only stay secret

575
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,679
for so long

576
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,520
so policy is visible with get Ops uh and

577
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,860
then get so it's visible to those that

578
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,059
need to see it

579
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,179
then uh we started looking at something

580
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,480
like semantic versioning that no doubt

581
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,840
you're using but a quick recap on it

582
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,460
semantic versioning the first segment

583
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,179
and semantics versioning we see the one

584
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,480
is indicating major versions perhaps

585
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,000
conflicting changes and if we apply that

586
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
to the context of policy it could be a

587
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,400
policy that expresses that

588
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,760
all resources require a department level

589
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,400
like who's the owner

590
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,860
and that would help with things like

591
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,919
cross charging who knows like an

592
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,279
increment to that uh field could be

593
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,860
something that requires to be from a

594
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,080
predetermined list rather than free text

595
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,320
so we're expanding this notion of policy

596
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,440
then the second segment indicates thinks

597
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,960
like minor changes things that are easy

598
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,880
to update and are not going to break

599
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,340
anyone an increment from there will look

600
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,440
like you're correcting a spelling

601
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,900
mistake that was done in the policy or a

602
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,580
department name change

603
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,400
the third segment and Decay indicates

604
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,380
path changes

605
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,539
so that'd be like fairly easy like a

606
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,880
no-brainer to to keep up with an

607
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,220
increment and and this field would be

608
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,980
like adding more departments to the

609
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,840
available options

610
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,900
so great the policy is visible it's in a

611
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,539
repository now it's versioned so people

612
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,360
understand when changes have occurred

613
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,600
uh we can tack release notes every time

614
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,299
there's an update in the versioning and

615
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,700
uh all the expectations are managed

616
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,980
along that semantic versioning

617
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,740
so in software we're used to handling

618
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,120
dependencies

619
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,000
so what if this policy was just another

620
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,880
dependency of the code

621
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,419
you might be unwittingly doing this to

622
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,120
some degree staking something like a

623
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,820
dependency on your JavaScript package

624
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,100
perhaps like eslint

625
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,720
so

626
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,700
we talk visible

627
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,440
communicable

628
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,320
and consumable

629
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,179
like software

630
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,900
and then we we go on to unit testing and

631
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,179
testing is somewhat of a dirty word but

632
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,740
in order to make this an asset everyone

633
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,539
can depend on and also provide good

634
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,940
examples tests are essential to give

635
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,179
fire alarm

636
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,919
all right good to know

637
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,419
no Panic I was I was once in Hawaii at a

638
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,220
ultra marathon Race

639
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,580
and everyone's phone blurred up for a

640
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,700
incoming missile

641
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,100
yeah

642
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,159
and coming missile and it was a it was a

643
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,220
test from the Department of Defense

644
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,740
dad gone

645
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,720
out to everyone

646
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,240
so yeah the policy the policy wasn't

647
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
honored in that instance or the

648
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,799
policiest code was not enforceable and

649
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,539
it was it was quite the situation within

650
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,700
five minutes we did get hey false alarm

651
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,500
no missiles nothing to do uh great okay

652
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,900
so so back to policy and keeping on on

653
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,340
making at EC

654
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,500
everyone's confidence and the stability

655
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,659
and the potential

656
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,679
side effects of of everyone involved all

657
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,559
the stakeholders are trying to to be

658
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,539
like better grasped so the consumers of

659
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,039
the policy need to be able to test

660
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,260
themselves talking about unit testing

661
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,240
against the policy

662
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,220
going back to that shift shifting left

663
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,860
it shortens the feedback loop

664
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,320
so as a bonus you're finding your

665
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,600
consumers able to rely on the artifact

666
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,340
you're sharing with them

667
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,740
so taking on the home stretch is a

668
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,779
dependency so updating it's not

669
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,520
different to anything else in software

670
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,980
you can use some magic like githubs the

671
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,440
panda bot or meant to renovate and do

672
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,659
that for you think like automatic pull

673
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,419
requests if you heard about those tests

674
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,600
even automatic merging

675
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,240
I did say policy is doll so if it's not

676
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,240
the most energizing start of the day you

677
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,200
can tell me like a recent event that

678
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,120
cost everyone

679
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,980
in every industry

680
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,659
what version of a certain logging Java

681
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,880
doohickey where was everyone potentially

682
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,740
running literally in every in every

683
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,980
state

684
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,559
lock 4J you guys heard about that that

685
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,360
one

686
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,299
so all presentations and 2022 2023

687
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,520
are contractually required to have some

688
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,000
reference to log4j give given what that

689
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,700
cost even if it's almost entirely out of

690
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,520
context so I'm being I'm being compliant

691
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,399
there and including some memes about it

692
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
hopefully mid-year we can start to

693
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,600
remove these

694
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,679
and just to point as a broadly scary

695
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,039
look of a list of vulnerabilities

696
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,080
in order of like commanding Behavior

697
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,380
through fear uh you see a lot of scores

698
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,120
10 9 and above

699
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,899
it's if you cyber and policy it's all

700
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,380
about ultimately like and the reference

701
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,000
to lock 4J

702
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,880
as situational awareness of

703
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,220
your software supply chain

704
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,960
is something your company's probably

705
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,779
started to do to avoid being on the

706
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,480
headlines on media and the News having

707
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,120
the negative press cyclists pick up so

708
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,760
if policies are dependency it's not a

709
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,399
new problem like if and the software

710
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,539
supply chain

711
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,460
context you might have started hearing

712
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,460
about software bills bills and materials

713
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,740
the promise of having like list of

714
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,419
ingredients

715
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,640
so that can help us measure compliance

716
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,000
of like what packages are in there so

717
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,700
lots of ground there hopefully some of

718
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,799
it sounds convincing is not some

719
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,220
fictional Utopia on PowerPoint it's time

720
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,200
to look at like how you might actually

721
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,700
implement this

722
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,620
and like you didn't come in here to

723
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,120
start the day wanting to see a million

724
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,940
words on the slide you're an emoji or

725
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,820
two so at this point I can show you some

726
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,940
Co code maintain scope uh we're gonna

727
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,620
talk about two things to prove it's not

728
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,620
just technology or or one Tool uh We've

729
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,779
arbitrarily picked terraform it's a

730
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,140
quite popular configuration management

731
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,360
system provisioning tool it's open

732
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,399
source and then kubernetes which has

733
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,940
become like the infrastructure

734
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,740
interface that most modern applications

735
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,960
get get built on but you could you could

736
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,500
pick anything naturally like I just we

737
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,720
needed some tools but we're somewhat

738
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,539
lazy to invent new things here so

739
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,100
picking picking two other things that

740
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,340
exist in open source check off we'll do

741
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,039
that terraform part and caverna will do

742
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,260
the kubernetes so if you could if you

743
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,179
wanted to browse here's an example

744
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,460
GitHub organization

745
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,620
like I don't want you to like read the

746
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,179
whole thing or like try to grok the code

747
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,640
on screen uh it's just there to prove

748
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,799
it's a real thing uh that's been

749
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,500
prototyped uh that you can check out

750
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,100
that you can consume expand share with

751
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,520
the organization so this is a a sample

752
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,100
view of the repository the policies

753
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,480
stored there

754
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,640
and here's a view of that policy that

755
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,340
starts at version

756
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,740
1.0.0 and this policy requires a

757
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,080
department label on all resources

758
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,820
as long as that said it doesn't matter

759
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,500
what that is we've written some tests

760
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,360
for it so the passing test cases are

761
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,640
usable as a great example of what good

762
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,399
and what bat looks like we push the tag

763
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,679
and get we've added release notes we can

764
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,960
sign it cryptographically to verify

765
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,340
assurance

766
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,500
so Chris signed it there

767
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,840
version two of the policy looks very

768
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,700
similar but now that department field

769
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,740
has to be a predetermined list like like

770
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,799
before the test exists release notes are

771
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,880
written

772
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,640
2-1 is where we notice and correct the

773
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,559
spelling mistake for one of the options

774
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,899
in the list of departments two on one

775
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,200
we've added a new Department to the list

776
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,899
app one and then for one in the system

777
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,360
depend on on version one of the policy

778
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,419
are not compliant with version two but

779
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,299
how can we how can we infer that we've

780
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,559
configured this to renovate

781
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,679
automatically and code so there's a new

782
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,599
version of the policy it's super obvious

783
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,839
to update the dependency and uh recent

784
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,480
against it clear feedback of where and

785
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,940
where not your compliant you can see the

786
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,639
pull requests uh all the merges all the

787
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,580
mergers from uh the stakeholders so you

788
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,339
can measure the compliance of the policy

789
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,859
so if you're moving from app2 and infra

790
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,320
to they they have that dependency you

791
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,300
could merge the open pull requests all

792
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,859
the way to uh 2-1-1 and finally app

793
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,719
three and in for three are dependent and

794
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,000
on two what one and that gets a gold

795
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
star from the CIO there's a little bit

796
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,040
of magic there all of it's not not

797
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,500
pretty it's like written bash no

798
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,199
judgment there but uh it's not the worst

799
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,739
code it's probably worse uh it does

800
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,260
allow to test for my developer machine

801
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,040
and into my pipeline my code against a

802
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,339
particular version of policy so uh yeah

803
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,640
that's that's an interesting bit

804
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,380
um

805
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,060
the last piece of the Apostle is

806
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,740
managing the life cycle of the policy

807
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,320
and allowing multiple policies to be

808
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,900
accepted and evaluated with a single

809
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,640
runtime

810
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,200
a little bit of cheating because

811
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
kubernetes gives you something called

812
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,579
admission controls so it's not easy to

813
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,680
get the same policy evaluation you would

814
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,820
have in the cloud

815
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,619
although it has its own uh

816
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,640
policy code and and kubernetes and uh

817
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,160
we're making some changes there you may

818
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,020
have noticed that the policy is decide

819
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,780
and distributed it lends itself to be

820
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,760
reused in multiple clusters and multiple

821
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,339
platforms which brings cluster one

822
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,800
cluster two

823
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,859
um all the automation we use separate

824
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,960
tooling and then

825
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,780
all you have captured in code is like

826
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,060
compliant it's the policy is all

827
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,720
versioned the CIO has visibility and

828
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
context that has the awareness of what's

829
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,220
going on it's great like the one more

830
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,380
thing that would be awesome if the

831
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,060
policy carried a story of why it exists

832
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,680
what is it

833
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,660
not what it ought to be like it's reason

834
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,900
of existence after all your agile teams

835
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,500
if they're effective they will reject

836
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,020
anything they perceive as friction

837
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,180
they're slowing them down if they don't

838
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,800
see value for it so they need to

839
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
understand the why so it helps them

840
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,260
understand if they're compliant if they

841
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,880
want to do something outside what the

842
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,339
policy permits

843
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,020
they don't need any any sort of

844
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,540
exemption granted for this

845
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,880
they they can have a well recent and

846
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,220
informed debate defensible arguments

847
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,040
with the rationale once it has that

848
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,140
story so if you're going through States

849
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,660
reversions and then the risk informs the

850
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,020
mitigations that's expressed there

851
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,940
maintained all in the code so when the

852
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,160
rest landscape changes as it continues

853
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,220
to evolve your policies can can evolve

854
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,160
with it new regulation comes in or your

855
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,579
latest marketing strategy has changed

856
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:19,800
and spaying off and you acquire more

857
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,680
data as a result so the policy that was

858
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,400
good before that that exists is no

859
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
longer that great like the risk and the

860
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,660
appetite stands still with it so liking

861
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,520
it to over provisioning that's where

862
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,260
like the real culture change is needed

863
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,480
and the execution of that is probably

864
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,119
like an entire series of talk but this

865
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,760
is really all to you now like

866
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,040
you can tell if it's something that

867
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,079
resonates with you

868
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,079
um a lot would love to chat more but

869
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,260
yeah uh check out the code uh talk to

870
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,380
people making like more than getting

871
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,720
developers on board and like pull

872
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,300
requests on like helping us grow and

873
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,880
have traction if this is a movement we

874
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,339
really like to like find design

875
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,619
Partnerships understand your use cases

876
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,500
and desired outcomes of how can we do

877
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,599
this policy as code and function of you

878
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,540
and start to swap this imaginary people

879
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,859
for real people you and the audience

880
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,839
the the most important thing from from

881
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,720
our time together is precisely that the

882
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,300
the relationships we establish and

883
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,160
thinking of it as a social technical

884
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,099
system if you invest if you're going

885
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,599
through a transformation and you're

886
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,359
invest solely and Technology

887
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,220
you only get so far

888
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,980
if you think it's keep a people problem

889
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,320
and you invest in training and upskill

890
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,780
them but don't do do so with modern

891
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,839
tooling you also only get so far so you

892
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,460
have to do this too

893
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,060
in conjunction because change is hard

894
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,440
so

895
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,859
the one thing just like the if you could

896
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,320
retain one thing at all is like

897
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,480
purposeless policy

898
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,900
is the same as a pointless policy

899
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,440
it's it's just words on a document so

900
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,720
get bringing the story

901
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,060
and that policy

902
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,339
and to life letting it burst into a life

903
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,560
of its own and being something that we

904
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,900
can all see we can all understand we can

905
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,660
express we can resend as is what gets us

906
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,339
to a better place

907
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,280
uh here's once again the repository to

908
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,740
the code

909
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,940
uh again like

910
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,940
risk risk has to be or security has to

911
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,640
be to measure it to the to the risk that

912
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,180
exists uh so does your investments in in

913
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,280
cyber security

914
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,579
um but yeah that's that's the talk uh

915
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,839
hopefully you have found this

916
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,740
informational uh entertaining

917
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,579
um

918
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,640
I'm I may not have all the answers uh

919
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,680
I'll take I'll take questions but I do

920
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,140
think we're a time but

921
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,680
yeah more than more than answers uh

922
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,140
I'm here to have conversations

923
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,760
and then exchange and learn from each

924
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,579
other so thank you very much once again

925
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,920
a great pleasure to be here beautiful

926
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,140
place in the world and uh looking

927
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,460
forward to spending today and tomorrow

928
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,680
with you

929
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,700
thank you

930
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,540
a couple questions yeah man come on up

931
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,000
let's take some questions

932
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,480
please

933
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,220
are the exceptions

934
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,619
I get right in the

935
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,760
yeah

936
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,220
all right so I have a very deep voice

937
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,880
and great vocal range

938
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,640
oh there we go yes so I get uh writing

939
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,200
the policy

940
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,079
um as you know whatever happens normally

941
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,020
and you have the throws and exceptions

942
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,480
for edge cases things that might happen

943
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,839
that are that are unusual uh but what I

944
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,359
was kind of esteemed still didn't quite

945
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,300
get clear in terms of um

946
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
thinking of

947
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
of dependencies and inheritances uh

948
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,460
going back to my my student days as kind

949
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,800
of like uh oop object oriented

950
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
programming

951
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,200
um

952
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,800
how do you do that in in terms of in

953
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,980
terms of policy because it seems kind of

954
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,180
hard to to express that as code

955
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,579
I mean could you expand like how you

956
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,359
make that readable for for not us as

957
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,400
people who said who said policies but

958
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,980
kind of Translating that what we want to

959
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,680
communicate to develop the teams to to

960
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,960
other technical people that's that's a

961
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,060
great question an analogous to object

962
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,740
oriented programming

963
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,520
you have classes and you have

964
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,339
objects that are instances of of those

965
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:22,040
classes like manifestations right so

966
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,780
being being just like

967
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,300
playing if it was if it was not object

968
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,800
oriented

969
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,339
if your policy becomes code and that is

970
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:34,020
just like putting the curly braces

971
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,260
around it you're not instantiated you're

972
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,320
not instant shading like the multiple

973
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,440
variances of of that policy in existence

974
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,560
so turning it turning it into a class

975
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,480
and having having that called out

976
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,320
and saying okay

977
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,540
a hierarchy of policies and that

978
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,640
composition where

979
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,060
a later semantic version of like 2-1-1

980
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,060
you could have a dependency on like the

981
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,599
Baseline as 1.0 so that's what we mean

982
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,220
by like establishing like that

983
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,060
relationship as a dependency of like you

984
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,540
can have a Baseline and then the

985
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,720
multiple variances that fork from there

986
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,560
would at least need to depend on on wano

987
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,000
does that conceptually make sense

988
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,560
like a polymorphism yes

989
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
sorry uh so what you're describing is a

990
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,079
kind of a polymorphism where you can

991
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,480
have several inputs several different

992
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,060
kinds of inputs into one in into one

993
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,740
policy depending on dependent on

994
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,599
condition of what actually is passed

995
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,260
into correctly correct okay it's an

996
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,060
interesting concept

997
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,900
I don't know unless you are a regulator

998
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,660
or somebody in in there who has a

999
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,880
technical background I still understand

1000
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,160
like yes that all of us went to see a

1001
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,640
school and so forth but I definitely

1002
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,319
um would like to have some like

1003
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,180
resources and so forth that I could pass

1004
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,640
on so people can get it because I I kind

1005
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,859
of get it because I have a CS background

1006
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,020
but I know I know a lot of people

1007
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,720
wouldn't yeah and it's a steep learning

1008
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,060
curve because it is bringing

1009
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,540
a lot of like heavy computer science and

1010
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,880
to and to a domain that has been

1011
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,680
probably more lawyerly and more uh

1012
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,359
prosaic

1013
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,720
uh but yeah just like another form of

1014
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,599
analogous to describing that without

1015
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,400
like talking about object oriented

1016
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,200
programming or polymerism is thinking of

1017
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,880
input lists right like you're you're

1018
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,400
building software and you're making the

1019
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,339
policy a dependency as all all the list

1020
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,560
of libraries and packages you're putting

1021
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,359
in there and being able to call it out

1022
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:04,140
when you're assembling at build time uh

1023
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,420
saying like we're depending on this

1024
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,819
policy for this particular release

1025
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,920
thank you great question

1026
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,839
um I just have a quick question

1027
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,900
um please more on a Consulting side but

1028
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,240
um with chat gbt and the risks of

1029
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,660
employees sharing or verifying code

1030
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,819
um what's your recommendations on how

1031
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,260
best to tackle this in terms of

1032
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,420
businesses adopting this to their

1033
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,220
corporate policy as well as cyber

1034
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,780
security

1035
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,280
wow

1036
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,599
that's that's quite the question

1037
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,700
see if I can do it justice and lots of

1038
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,839
thoughts

1039
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,500
um still forming an opinion and I think

1040
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,780
it's nascent

1041
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,480
it's it's growing so fast and we're

1042
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,619
seeing it like people

1043
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:55,440
relying Less on Google and uh opting for

1044
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,200
like having a chat DPT window open all

1045
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,700
day

1046
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,220
if if

1047
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,839
it's the place people are seeking

1048
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,339
information

1049
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:08,099
and the organization doesn't allow it

1050
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,599
people are going to attempt to

1051
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,720
circumvent that right like they're gonna

1052
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,060
open it up on their phone and they're

1053
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,680
not going to access it from the from the

1054
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,540
company Network they're gonna access it

1055
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,300
on the over the 5G and and seek

1056
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,740
information there

1057
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,839
it's important to have segmentation and

1058
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,579
isolation

1059
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,780
if it's if it's used as a as a tool for

1060
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,839
again information gathering

1061
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:34,380
um

1062
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,920
and Chad GPT unless like the company has

1063
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,839
decided to like wrap around it and say

1064
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,640
like Hey we're gonna we're going to have

1065
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,760
chat DPT for all our knowledge basis and

1066
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,760
half crawled that that data uh if that's

1067
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,420
the path like having segmentation and

1068
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,260
say zero trust like really like a hard

1069
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,119
mapping of what the guard rails of the

1070
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,680
system is so there's no informational

1071
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,940
leakage but probably probably timely to

1072
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,000
start Gathering the people together and

1073
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,040
having the conversation of like which

1074
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,520
way do we want to utilize and rely as

1075
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,700
opposed to to oppose it uh before it

1076
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,200
proliferates and it's something that

1077
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,319
people just I mean it becomes their day

1078
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,220
to day

1079
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,939
thank you

1080
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,319
um sorry at this time we need to move

1081
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,800
forward so he is going to be around

1082
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,900
please meet with Andres and ask him more

1083
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,079
questions if you'd like love the focus

1084
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,060
that you did during our alert thank you

1085
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,420
very much
