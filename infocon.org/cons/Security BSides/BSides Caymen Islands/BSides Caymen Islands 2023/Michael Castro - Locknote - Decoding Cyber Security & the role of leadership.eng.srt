1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,199
everybody

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,720
so I've been where you have all been

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,259
with being the listening to the last

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,960
speaker of the day and I know what it

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,020
stands between you and the prizes in

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,300
closing in closing ceremonies

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,880
so I will try to make this as painless

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,500
as possible and the good news is

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,720
um in less than an hour we'll be done

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,300
and we'll be at that stage the bad news

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,500
is

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,719
it's going to be an hour before we're at

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,280
that stage

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,660
so we're going to talk about uh today uh

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,120
decoding cyber and Leadership I want to

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,739
thank besides for the opportunity to be

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,960
here and James and his team have done a

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,000
great job over these days I think it's

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
been a wonderful conference and it's

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,199
been great to be down here on the island

21
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,120
to experience both the conference and

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,180
the hospitality that we have here

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,579
what I want to talk to you today in my

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,640
chat is really about what has happened

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
how did we get to where we are today

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,479
with cyber security

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,020
and how really and ultimately the byline

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
story is how have I learned through my

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
life uh really

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,460
what helped me through everything that

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,880
I've learned that made me uh able to

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
deal with the cyber security challenges

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,200
that we did that we have today I say I

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,520
have two clickers now so hopefully I got

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,799
the right one there it is

36
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,299
so

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,259
I was a child of the 70s

38
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,079
born in the 60s grew up in the 70s I

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,360
watched The Flintstones every day I

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,159
would run home from school

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,720
watch the have my uh my lunch watch The

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,939
Flintstones head back to school

43
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,159
we look at that now and looking back we

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,040
say wow what a simplistic life back then

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,860
we sure we had all these fancy things

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,780
that they brought us that we imagined

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,320
dinosaurs and and cars made out of stone

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
and all the celebrities that came on but

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
overall it was a pretty simple life

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,360
compared to what we have today

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,560
as a child I joined the Boy Scouts I'm

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,020
from Canada I joined the Boy Scouts

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,959
really helped me focus on a lot of

54
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,840
things I learned two things that started

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
my career that I got really excited

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,180
about one was about learning first aid

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,879
and how to help people when they were in

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,440
need and injured and how I could take

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,180
care of myself if I got lost in the

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,140
woods

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,000
the other thing I learned was about

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,340
computers and the dawn of where

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,860
computers first showed up was an

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,940
exciting time very simple but yet as a

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,879
child exposed to that my first computer

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
that I went out and bought on my own I

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,120
bought at Radio Shack local electronics

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,700
store at the time in Canada I put my

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,440
money together to buy this color

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,480
computer too and sure I played a lot of

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,959
games all eight or 16 bits

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,420
um but it got me on the path to starting

73
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,379
to learn how to code how to write in

74
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,580
basic and learn the power of a computer

75
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,519
that I could put in some code and with

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,819
20 lines I could make this little bar on

77
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,920
the screen go from left to right it was

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,540
amazing

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,840
my first modem my first connection to

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,440
the very very early internet was this

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,260
device that I bought

82
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,540
300 bits per second not 300 megabits per

83
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,180
second 300 bits per second I had to

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,060
unplug my parents phone line they really

85
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,340
didn't like that plug it into my

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,560
computer hook up to a bulletin board

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,159
that had a dial-up number and then in 12

88
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,640
short minutes I could see a picture when

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,459
I went to the NASA website or their

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,560
bulletin board 12 minutes later I was

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,340
staring at a picture of the Stars

92
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,860
it was amazing now we look at it today

93
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,200
of course and and the capabilities that

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,080
we have today but trust me in the 80s

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,220
this was the way to be

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,560
um I went into after I went to school

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,100
got a degree in many things not related

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,800
to computers but a minor in computer

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
science I became a paramedic long story

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,979
how that happens but I spent 10 years in

101
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,860
Toronto Frontline paramedic helping

102
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,320
people working

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
it was also a flight medic many many

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,540
situations very exciting but harrowing

105
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,620
career

106
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,040
and then I jumped out of paramedicine

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,139
and into

108
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,360
I.T and cyber security actually stumbled

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,580
into cyber security so you think about

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,340
this the late 90s

111
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,979
um different times security really

112
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,220
wasn't what it is today and so as

113
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,020
mentioned I've worked for many many

114
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,199
large organizations through my career uh

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
head of of cyber security Internet

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,060
Security uh for for the likes of these

117
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,120
organizations uh both Canadian and in

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
the U.S and as mentioned now I am

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,419
retired from the corporate life and run

120
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,900
a cyber security firm focusing on small

121
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,340
medium businesses and advisory services

122
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,400
now one of the

123
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,220
very poignant quotes that has carried me

124
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,720
through my career is this from Stephen

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Covey if you read any of his books the

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,660
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

127
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,919
one of the things that has always stuck

128
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
with me is this quote if there's one

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
thing that's certain in business it's

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,220
uncertainty and I think that really

131
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,380
plays for all of us in this room when we

132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,419
think about cyber security because the

133
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,220
one thing that we know in cyber security

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,199
the one thing that I definitely have

135
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,240
learned over the years and I'm sure you

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
have too is there's nothing static in

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,180
cyber security it's always evolving

138
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,880
I can very to easily tell you that the

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,419
challenges the risks the threats that I

140
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,520
encountered in 25 years in the business

141
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,620
that I encountered early in my career

142
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,199
are nothing in comparison to what we see

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,660
today and what is happening in the world

144
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,639
today

145
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,699
so there have been some really some

146
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,580
general business trends that have really

147
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,940
formulated to where we are in the world

148
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,180
today obviously technology is a big one

149
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,460
technology has changed so much we are

150
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
now in what is known as the industrial

151
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,060
fourth Revolution or industry 4.0

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,240
we've seen drastic changes in supply

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,900
chain and

154
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,080
automation we're seeing robots doing the

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,600
jobs that humans used to do and

156
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,400
warehouses that are manned more by by

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,500
technology than there are by humans

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,300
themselves

159
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,880
we're seeing loyalty programs and award

160
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,840
programs especially in North America

161
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,319
consumers love loyalty programs uh who

162
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,120
wouldn't want to get free groceries when

163
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,280
when we're when when shops at a grocery

164
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,240
store

165
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,620
but loyalty programs and the information

166
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,759
that we share

167
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,000
is very very dangerous and very very

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,479
large as we talk about how much data is

169
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,819
flowing through these loyalty programs

170
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,620
we talk about digital payments the

171
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,199
explosion of cryptocurrency the world

172
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,960
that we live in where you know for most

173
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,160
of my year I don't walk around with cash

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,599
anymore everything is either digital or

175
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,259
tap with the credit cards who needs cash

176
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,099
um

177
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,620
but digital payments come with those

178
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,380
risks as well we see e-commerce my

179
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,319
goodness it's amazing

180
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,300
um especially when you live in a large

181
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,720
urban center I can go onto Amazon on a

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,460
Monday morning and have something

183
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,680
delivered to my house

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
four hours later

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,479
I can order groceries and somebody will

186
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,780
go pick them and bring them to my door

187
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,300
that's fantastic who needs to ever leave

188
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,160
their house

189
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,020
um but e-commerce is everywhere

190
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,419
e-commerce it's all driven by the

191
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,740
internet and our abilities to use

192
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,719
technology and then we have things like

193
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,020
data data analytics data data data there

194
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,399
is so much data out there we have

195
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,200
um data

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
um that we don't even know exists about

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
ourselves and everything else that is

198
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,440
spread everywhere and in fact 92 percent

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,920
or over 92 percent of all the data that

200
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,019
is collected has been collected in the

201
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,380
last few years alone we rely heavily on

202
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,740
data and it is that data that is getting

203
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,339
a lot of organizations and consumers

204
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,019
into trouble

205
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,700
and then we have of course cognitive

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,339
Technologies AI my goodness you can't go

207
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,720
anywhere now without talking about chat

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,000
gbt and everything else that goes with

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,760
it the the emerging the explosion of

210
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,100
artificial intelligence is really

211
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
changing not only the way we do we

212
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,140
handle our lives but the way as cyber

213
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
security people not only makes our lives

214
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,519
easier but it also makes it more

215
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,800
difficult at the same time

216
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
so the fourth Industrial Revolution

217
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,000
quick video I want to show

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm sure many of you know what it is but

219
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,550
let's take a quick look at this video

220
00:09:43,550 --> 00:10:32,060
[Music]

221
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,779
thank you

222
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,879
[Music]

223
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,920
[Music]

224
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,060
thank you

225
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,480
foreign

226
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:11,789
[Music]

227
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,220
[Music]

228
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,160
so the numbers are staggering now

229
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,640
it is predicted that a mere five six

230
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,500
years ago there were already 10 billion

231
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,320
devices hooked to the internet

232
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,459
that number has already been figured to

233
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,980
already have doubled in the in this

234
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,200
Gantt few years

235
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,920
um between 2017 and now and that number

236
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,540
exponentially they figure is going to

237
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,760
grow over the next couple

238
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,820
they say that there are there is a

239
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,220
device connected to the internet for

240
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,700
every single person on Earth and that

241
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,940
number expected to get even bigger and

242
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,320
the amount of traffic that is flowing

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
around the world

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,100
uh is in words that I can't that I'm not

245
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,839
even used to saying on a regular basis

246
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,300
like zettabytes

247
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,980
The Staggering thing that I find that's

248
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,899
really weird but you know you think

249
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,640
about it they figure that almost

250
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,940
everything in one day will be connected

251
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,380
to the internet

252
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,620
and we're already seeing that iot

253
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,000
Internet of Things there's so many

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,740
things that are connected to the

255
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,600
internet my house alone has

256
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,420
43 devices connected to my Wi-Fi and no

257
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,980
I do not have a server Farm in my

258
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,740
basement

259
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,899
we're seeing appliances now it's getting

260
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,300
more and more difficult to buy a

261
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,940
refrigerator that doesn't have some

262
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,860
connectivity

263
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,880
and we're even seeing tags and RFID

264
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,380
embedded into clothing that we buy today

265
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,100
to help us help us with our exercises

266
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,139
and staying fit

267
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,380
truly there is a lot of data out there

268
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,880
data is the new oil so back in the 70s

269
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,860
everything was about oil it was the

270
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,880
commodity to have but now it's data we

271
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,420
are buying data selling data it is in

272
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,959
good places it is in bad places

273
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,680
um but it is a value to so so many and

274
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,560
so it has become extremely important for

275
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
all of us to be protecting it and to be

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,660
working with that

277
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,959
we're seeing Electronics connectivity

278
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,899
we've mentioned

279
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,820
everywhere we go we are looking at

280
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,639
data and connectivity that we from a

281
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,980
cyber security lens have a

282
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,380
responsibility for

283
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,019
you know almost 100 years ago Nikola

284
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,720
Tesla so he was the inventor of the

285
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,060
electric motor and AC current

286
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,000
alternating current this was his quote

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,440
back in 1926.

288
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,980
basically when Wireless is applied all

289
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,579
things will be able to do be simplified

290
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,279
and a man will be able to carry Wireless

291
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,860
in his vest pocket okay we don't wear

292
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,839
vests like we used to but you get the

293
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:25,680
gist

294
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
there already was a prediction of what

295
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,060
was going to happen

296
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,579
um and and quite honestly it's amazing

297
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,339
but it's frightening at the same time

298
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,480
chat gbt wow Our Lives as practitioners

299
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,800
and security

300
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,100
is going to benefit from the likes of

301
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,860
chat gbt and other AI it's going to help

302
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,160
us do better at finding malware it's

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
going to help us better at being alerted

304
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
and notifying and determining the

305
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,660
effects of things but of course you know

306
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,880
there's always a bad side you know we're

307
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,480
going to see new malware new coding new

308
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,519
abilities that are going to be wreaking

309
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,940
havoc on us and our organizations that

310
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,519
we're going to have to deal with

311
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
we're going to see more and more attacks

312
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,320
on Robotics and the automation side

313
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,220
you imagine all those robots that exist

314
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,040
all are run by software and all it takes

315
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,940
is an attacker to go in and manipulate

316
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,720
the code and we end up in a scenario

317
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,680
where we might have inaccuracies

318
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,560
deficiencies loss of control loss of

319
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,540
functionality

320
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,480
uneven data exfiltration

321
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,620
fun fact Amazon the largest

322
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,760
um company running robotics they have a

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,620
fleet of 200

324
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,199
000 robots in their data centers

325
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,060
worldwide and if you've ever seen them

326
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
they're they're primarily those little

327
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,380
squares that go under the big stacks of

328
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,360
that the pickers have lift them up move

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,639
them around 200

330
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,820
000 all following a predefined line

331
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
getting from point A to point B

332
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
but just last year

333
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,579
they introduced ones that don't work

334
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,660
that way anymore and are able to work

335
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,880
independently and figure their way out

336
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,579
autonomous we call it

337
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,399
we've seen the rise and the

338
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,260
predictability of quantum Computing it's

339
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,899
coming those amazing new computers are

340
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,399
coming

341
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,720
um but they're going to potentially

342
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,699
wreck some havoc on what we have to deal

343
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,040
with and in our world you know we think

344
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,620
about cryptography now it you know we'll

345
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,839
always have the camps to say no our

346
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,480
current encryption is quantum resistant

347
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,540
but is it really time will tell if

348
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,459
that's truly the case and of course we

349
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,660
don't even have to go into the effects

350
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,040
of cryptocurrency anything that involves

351
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,559
encryption and what it could mean

352
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,859
we see criminals monetizing their

353
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,579
ability to

354
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,040
manipulate through through their threats

355
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,579
and through their exploits including

356
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,980
um you know taking over computers for

357
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,240
crypto mining which yes still exists

358
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,400
um despite the ups and downs of

359
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
cryptocurrency as it is today

360
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,480
so really you know we we we're you know

361
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,340
as a child I thought we lived in a world

362
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,200
of Simplicity with The Flintstones now

363
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
as I work within cyber security I think

364
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,860
we live more in the world of the Jetsons

365
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,039
The Jetsons by the way came out in the

366
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,740
60s

367
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,440
it was set in a date in the future

368
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
obviously 20 86.

369
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
so still 60 years where we are today but

370
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,980
60 years ago this show came on I was

371
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,919
just taking notes on how many things I'm

372
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,600
sure some of you have seen the Jetsons

373
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,580
how many things

374
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,080
that are already here that were in the

375
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,820
TV show and I just jotted down a couple

376
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,720
of them

377
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,299
the mobile phone

378
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,840
video conferencing

379
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,720
connected treadmills

380
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,860
online shopping

381
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,440
virtual Health Care

382
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,620
and of course robots particularly robots

383
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,020
that clean your house

384
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
so all of these and this is just a few

385
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
all of these were imagined by creators

386
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,539
of a cartoon 60 years ago and here we

387
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,700
are with these things true don't have

388
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,740
the flying saucers yet but they're

389
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,480
coming they're coming and you know they

390
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,220
are

391
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,280
in fact it feels like yes it's great

392
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,720
that we're in The Jetsons but it really

393
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,900
feels like we're in the world of uh the

394
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,480
Terminator and the rise of the Machines

395
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,900
with all the move up we have with all

396
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,880
the capabilities with machine learning

397
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,340
and artificial intelligence I don't know

398
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,660
how many of you were fans of the

399
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,020
Terminator show I found it amazing

400
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,080
but it was the ability of the machines

401
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
to learn It ultimately LED them to

402
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
taking over the world kind of a

403
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
frightening ideas that exists as it is

404
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
so cyber security

405
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,740
all of these things I've just talked

406
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,440
about have created this very growing

407
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,580
industry it's called cyber security what

408
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,919
all of us are in and if we really Define

409
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,500
it and it's been defined here by the

410
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,360
national cyber security Center in the UK

411
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
the protection of devices services and

412
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,760
networks and the information on them

413
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,059
from theft and damage

414
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,220
so we learn as we as we become cyber

415
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,559
professionals we learn about people

416
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,380
processing technology we learn how all

417
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,679
of those have a role

418
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,799
in our ability to protect and and defend

419
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,620
our organizations to which we we have a

420
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,360
responsibility

421
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,400
but we know that that world isn't

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,020
perfect

423
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,940
um despite you know people and the

424
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,760
process in technology we have technology

425
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,299
that sometimes we don't use it properly

426
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,880
we know that there's technology put in

427
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,340
place to protect the organizations that

428
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,980
maybe have not been fought through or

429
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,260
really designed

430
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,539
um with the true picture in mind not

431
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,059
Photoshop by the way

432
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,400
um and then we know from a process in

433
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,780
technology

434
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,900
state that we can build processes we can

435
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,120
tell people what to do but we all know

436
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,919
what the weakest link is out there it's

437
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,020
not us

438
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,720
um people

439
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,179
bypass the capabilities that we have not

440
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,400
once but twice just in case you couldn't

441
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,559
read it

442
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,780
twice take over a physical security

443
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,740
capability that we put in

444
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,220
to protect and just that action by one

445
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,320
person

446
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,820
removes all the security that's behind

447
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,760
it and we all know all it takes is one

448
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,179
click

449
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,340
so going back as I said I entered into

450
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,419
cyber security in the late 90s

451
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,179
before Y2K I kind of got on board where

452
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,799
everyone was like don't talk to us we're

453
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,320
busy with Y2K

454
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,620
um but I can tell you

455
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,179
in the late 90s early 2000s the

456
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,580
emergence of the internet came and I can

457
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,840
tell you

458
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,799
having the internet in the turn of the

459
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,880
century

460
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,500
was really a really neat thing some

461
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,240
people think the internet is a good

462
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,340
thing

463
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,740
the most powerful educational tool the

464
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,830

466
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,100
it's preserving our history making sure

467
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,500
that in the future we never forget the

468
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,970
past

469
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,240

470
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
when disaster struck Asia the volume of

Aid donated by Ordinary People through

472

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,919
governments

474
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,500
the internet is a place that is free of

State regulation

476
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,240
censorship and control

477
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,059
the only place where freedom of speech

478
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,080
truly exists Orwell was wrong

479
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,419
it is not the state that holds all the

what do you think

486
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,220
so just in context this was a commercial

487
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,980
in the UK put out by AOL if you all

488
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,020
remember of course I aged myself so many

489
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,520
times

490
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,919
back in Canada we would get these discs

491
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,340
all the time in the mail CDs you'd put

492
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,320
in your computer and allowed you to

493
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,780
connect any consumer to connect it would

494
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,580
keep coming though they would come and

495
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,900
they come you could only use so many

496
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,039
coasters and frisbees AOL put out this

497
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,419
commercial to try to help people

498
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,020
understand how great the internet was

499
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,539
and the internet was great I mean even

500
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,020
as a early person in my role I started

501
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,340
my cyber career uh in a finance company

502
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,720
uh where there was no security I wasn't

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,480
even doing security at the time

504
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,539
um they they held on to investment funds

505
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,360
for parents they ran a fund that you

506
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,640
parents could put in money and make sure

507
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,620
that they had college fund basically for

508
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,240
their children uh they had at the time

509
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,419
uh 700 million dollars Canadian

510
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,480
um in assets and all stored in a

511
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,000
database and I remember going to talk to

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,640
the the dbas and they were showing me

513
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,320
this thing like oh look here see this is

514
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,600
this person has this much money and you

515
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,860
know this person they look at this

516
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,539
account it's very large and here's you

517
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,559
by the way

518
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,799
and I'm like oh well you know what if

519
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,240
that's wrong they're like oh we just can

520
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
go in and change the numbers

521
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,559
and a I thought hey this is really cool

522
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,820
um but then it was like whoa this is

523
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,320
this is wrong and I went so I went to go

524
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,780
talk to to the CEO and I was coming up

525
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,340
and I said hey by the way I was in there

526
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,260
and I really think we need to do

527
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,460
something or not that we don't trust the

528
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,440
dbas but

529
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,059
um you know I don't think that's a good

530
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,400
thing

531
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,900
therein launched my career in cyber

532
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,179
security Michael do something about that

533
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,340
so that's how I started in cyber

534
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,980
security uh from there I went and I

535
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,620
worked at a very large oil and gas firm

536
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,919
there were two of us for a company with

537
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,179
I think we had 12 000 employees

538
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,360
um but security was so simple there one

539
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,159
person was responsible for access

540
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,799
management they handled password resets

541
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,000
on the network and they dealt with uh

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
you know resetting and setting up and

543
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,120
terminating accounts my job was on the

544
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,159
network security side and that's what we

545
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,960
called it back then by the way there

546
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,200
were so many names I.T security network

547
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,140
security I worked for Help Desk

548
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,620
somehow once in a while uh worked for

549
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,799
for the legal department worked for uh

550
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,620
the I.T obviously

551
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,659
um but that was the function of the job

552
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,820
my job was on the network security side

553
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,960
and I had to try to make sure that

554
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,419
antivirus software was running on

555
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,940
people's machines now you have to

556
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,940
understand for those that aren't as aged

557
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,179
as I am that back in the 2000s not

558
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,580
everyone had a laptop let alone a

559
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,679
computer

560
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,080
and very very few people had internet

561
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,140
access it was the privilege of the few

562
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,940
you had to be

563
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,179
CEO or someone important in the company

564
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,080
or work in sales uh to have internet

565
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
access but nonetheless I had a job this

566
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,080
was my biggest fear every day when I

567
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,860
came to that I would come in and log in

568
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,620
to uh the brand new marketing website

569
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,940
and somebody overnight had gone in and

570
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,179
cracked it and broken in or had left

571
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,059
some really horrible message denouncing

572
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,460
something and laying claim with some

573
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
funny face that would laugh at me uh

574
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,220
that was my job and trust me I took it

575
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
very seriously

576
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,919
um

577
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,860
but you know our problems back then were

578
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,559
all based in I.T all we ever did was

579
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,559
deal with it at an I.T level and it

580
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,539
never got to leadership they had they

581
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,919
never knew what was going on we would

582
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,919
have a virus outbreak on 100 machines

583
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,679
the CEO probably never ever knew about

584
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,740
it we always contained it within

585
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,860
but look at the world today right we are

586
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,260
seeing cyber attacks increasing year

587
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,419
over year over year we're seeing

588
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,659
phishing attacks skyrocketing

589
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,840
and you know we are in a world now where

590
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,880
there's so much impact in in the news

591
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,320
all the time we see large corporations

592
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,440
everywhere uh being impacted by cyber

593
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
attacks and cyber breaches

594
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,779
we are seeing impacts even here on the

595
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,039
island uh where worrisome no matter how

596
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,400
small you are we are seeing uh threats

597
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,980
every day

598
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,640
we are seeing uh emergence of denial of

599
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
service attacks and attacks on our

600
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,440
infrastructure attacks on our supply

601
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,460
chain heck attacks on our our aquariums

602
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,880
at a casino in Las Vegas how dare they

603
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,740
by the way thirty five thousand dollars

604
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
they got out of this

605
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,779
um but then you know from a leadership

606
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,279
perspective we're seeing a lot of

607
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,200
outcomes as well we're seeing

608
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,279
organizations uh befalling to to large

609
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,980
cyber breaches we're seeing CEOs and

610
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,140
Senior leadership

611
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,140
um ending up losing their jobs because

612
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,960
of the size and the veracity of the

613
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,240
attacks that are happening

614
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,059
it really is a perfect storm where all

615
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,279
of this stuff is happening now the

616
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,740
sophistication the capabilities of the

617
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,679
threats are ever evolving it really is a

618
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,200
cat and mouse game for all of us

619
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,940
um and I gotta tell you there are some

620
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,039
really really smart threat actors out

621
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,760
there uh that know a lot of stuff

622
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,880
we are seeing teams that are overwhelmed

623
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,400
uh in their capabilities and their

624
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,480
Technologies we have shortages of cyber

625
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
staff they're saying now there are over

626
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,400
5 million people globally working

627
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,980
directly in cyber security like all of

628
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,399
you five million that's great because a

629
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,520
few years ago it was under three

630
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,279
the problem is is that there are three

631
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,000
million vacancies in cyber security

632
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,760
globally today

633
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,760
there are not enough people working at

634
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,679
it I can tell you when I when I entered

635
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,940
into cyber security there was no

636
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,880
training there was no school to go to

637
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,020
there was no dedicated degree program

638
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,340
about security

639
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,520
so we've come a long way but we have so

640
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
much further to go and we have

641
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,580
increasing impacts and costs we seeing

642
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,860
sophistication getting larger and larger

643
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,100
the costs to deal with it going higher

644
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,960
and higher close to five billion dollars

645
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,059
now on average for ransomware attacks

646
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,080
and we're seeing cyber security be a

647
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,720
multi-trillion dollar industry between

648
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,720
the money that is made and the money we

649
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,140
spend or our organizations spend to

650
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,580
protect us

651
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,820
it really is a world for leaders of

652
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,820
organizations to understand now unlike

653
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,419
what they did when I first started the

654
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,399
ramifications and the impacts of what

655
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,899
cyber security means to their company

656
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,779
the financial toll that it can take the

657
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,179
reputational toll and of course the

658
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,320
Share value

659
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,140
we have uh we're up in Canada uh and

660
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,419
right before Christmas one of our

661
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,140
top three grocery chains had a Cyber

662
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,820
attack

663
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,539
um

664
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,640
they were able to recover within a

665
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,960
couple weeks

666
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,140
32 million dollars it costs them to

667
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,320
recover from somebody clicking on a

668
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,860
phishing email

669
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
um it is not a cheap world that

670
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
organizations have to deal with and of

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,740
course the reputational hit from that as

672
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,740
well is quite large

673
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,799
we see really as practitioners then in a

674
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,140
world and as Leaders where you know we

675
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,360
struggle to really understand or to help

676
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,220
our organization understand what they

677
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,559
need to do how to do it and they really

678
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,580
need the leadership both at the company

679
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,220
level and at the security level to be

680
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,799
able to understand what to do how to do

681
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,840
it how to deal with these challenges

682
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,159
like missing people or or lack of of uh

683
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,679
availability of Staff or budget

684
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,020
restraints Etc

685
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,059
it really is a world now where the

686
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,380
internet

687
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,260
maybe isn't the good thing that it once

688
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,200
was some people think the internet is a

689
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,380
Bad Thing somewhere your identity can be

690
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,539
stolen your home invaded and you're

691
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,059
saving wrong without anyone setting foot

692
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,860
inside your door

693
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,200
it is one of the most dangerous weapons

694
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,179
ever created

695
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,539
a way for the unhinged to spread evil

696
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,200
free of supervision or censorship

697
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,500
a place for mankind to exercise its

698
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,580
darkest desires

699
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,260
an open market where you can purchase

700
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,010
anything you want

701
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,679
[Music]

702
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
Orwell was right the internet has taken

703
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,380
us to a place where everything we do is

704
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,039
watched monitored and processed without

705
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,980
us ever realized

706
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,440
some people think the internet is a bad

707
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,659
thing

708
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,740
what do you think

709
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,799
so I probably forgot to mention that AOL

710
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,220
also put another commercial out

711
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,820
also warning people about the internet

712
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,080
and I wish they would do that today

713
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,840
we're not seeing it nearly as as well as

714
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,360
we do we have a great representative

715
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,799
here on the island

716
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,620
teaching us about cyber safety but let

717
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,539
me tell you over the many years leading

718
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,059
up to now that didn't exist in consumers

719
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,220
especially really don't know

720
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,200
what is ahead

721
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,559
so as Leaders as practitioners with

722
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,539
insecurity we really need to understand

723
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,340
how to tackle this

724
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,220
we Face the challenges of budget

725
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,039
restraints we Face the challenges of

726
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,620
these increased attacks we Face the

727
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,080
challenges of new technology that it's

728
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,940
very hard to keep up with

729
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,100
how how as Leaders can we manage that

730
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,380
well I told you I was a boy scout I told

731
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,159
you how I loved learning and got into

732
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,679
computers one thing that taught me

733
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,059
another thing that taught me when I was

734
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,140
a boy scout was the 12 rules of being a

735
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,360
Boy Scout and we had to learn these

736
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,280
because it was kind of like the

737
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,199
guidebook the the rules that we had to

738
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,080
strive towards in order to be a good

739
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,619
scout and a good role model and

740
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,480
representative to society

741
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,820
can we turn that though and learn

742
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,359
on how that can help us be better cyber

743
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,699
leaders and I think it can so let's take

744
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,800
a look at some of these first off the

745
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,239
first rule of of being a scout

746
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,179
and cyber leader is that we have to be

747
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,399
trustworthy we have to tell the truth

748
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,060
keep promises people depend on you and

749
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,800
that is the reality

750
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,899
as csos As Leaders within cyber security

751
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,260
we are always in a role of trust we are

752
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,740
the base that people come to when there

753
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,720
is an issue when there is a threat when

754
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,160
there is something that we have to worry

755
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,740
about and trust is the pillar to that

756
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,740
and we have to use that trust in order

757
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,619
to help us do a good job and help us

758
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,720
build the confidence within the

759
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,060
organization

760
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,579
a Boy Scout and a cyber leader has to be

761
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,720
loyal

762
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,240
show you care about your family friends

763
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,460
school and Country okay that's fair

764
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,960
enough

765
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,240
um but as csos we can translate that

766
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,140
really into you know we need to bring

767
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,160
support we need to show our ability to

768
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,180
our friends our colleagues our employees

769
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,240
our organizations

770
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,880
that we are there to help them and we

771
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,920
are there to support them as they grow

772
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,300
their business we are not a gatekeeper

773
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,859
we are there to help build

774
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,420
Boy Scouts have to be helpful we have to

775
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,400
volunteer we have to help others without

776
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,980
expecting reward okay that's what

777
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,980
volunteering is all about absolutely but

778
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,960
we have to think of that as Leaders to

779
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,859
go beyond our Towers we have to work

780
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:16,320
beyond the how does this impact me when

781
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,820
something happens and we have to

782
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,220
understand that we have to be out there

783
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,859
within the organization and giving them

784
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:23,700
a hand

785
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,880
we have to be friendly we have to not be

786
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,500
The Gatekeepers I can tell you I went

787
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,660
through phases of my career or my job

788
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,700
was to say no no no no anytime they

789
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,440
wanted something no can't have it they

790
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,900
go darn it okay I also went through a

791
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,160
part of my career where I said no and

792
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,740
they said well I didn't ask

793
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,900
um those aren't the models anymore we

794
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,500
have to work together

795
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,900
with people to in order to succeed in

796
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,400
cyber security

797
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
we have to be courteous always use

798
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,380
manners I think that goes without saying

799
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,460
uh treat others as we treat ourselves we

800
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,700
want to be kind never harm or kill any

801
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,579
living thing without good reason okay I

802
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,720
think that's a pretty straightforward

803
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,140
model for being a CSO we don't kill okay

804
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,720
we may kill a process

805
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,079
that is affecting a machine but we don't

806
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,099
kill or harm

807
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,020
Boy Scouts need to be obedient they need

808
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,720
to follow the rules obey the laws of the

809
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,000
community and we have to adhere to that

810
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,640
right we have a job to do we have to

811
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,760
stay within the lines sometimes it feels

812
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,520
hard I know all the times in my career

813
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,460
that you know we would get an attack and

814
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,140
man I just wanted to turn around and

815
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,599
attack them back right just

816
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,300
counter-offensive uh security

817
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,119
um not always the best model to do but

818
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,119
we have to stay within the lines

819
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,099
we have to be cheerful always look

820
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,700
confident and positive trust me when you

821
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,960
have are faced with a a threat or a

822
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,060
Cyber attack everyone's looking at you

823
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,700
you know that they are all looking to

824
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,220
see how you deal with it you have to

825
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,480
stay confident you have to be

826
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,060
prepared and ready that not throw your

827
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,400
arms in the air say man we're pooched

828
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,859
we have to be the leaders when it comes

829
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,320
to things like cyber attacks

830
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,200
foreign we have to be Thrifty okay so

831
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,480
this is good not be wasteful for a Boy

832
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,579
Scout it means of course saving your

833
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,119
rations but for a cyber and and csos

834
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,400
it's really about understanding we don't

835
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
have unlimited budgets I don't think I

836
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,900
ever had an unlimited budget in my

837
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,859
career

838
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,400
I think the closest I had was going from

839
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,880
the there is no money to okay if you

840
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,400
help explain what you need maybe we can

841
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,440
give it to you

842
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,599
um so we have to realize that is csos

843
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,460
that we do have to be somewhat Thrifty

844
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,859
but we have to spend the money in the

845
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,200
right ways not by the shiny new object

846
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,960
but understand what the needs are for

847
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,540
organization as Leaders what can we do

848
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,520
with the resources and the funds that we

849
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,760
have in order to best protect our

850
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,160
organizations and the information that's

851
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,700
within it

852
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,359
and we have to be brave okay we have to

853
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,060
face those difficult situations as I

854
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,280
mentioned everyone looks to you when

855
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,099
there's a cyber breach uh you have to

856
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,619
lead by example

857
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,260
and finally we've got to keep clean

858
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,839
uh help helping home

859
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,560
our job is to keep our companies safe

860
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,119
so

861
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,619
Deloitte put out this many years ago to

862
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,560
kind of show the four faces of a CSO if

863
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,420
you think about it as leaders and

864
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,880
aspiring leaders all of these are very

865
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
key things that we have to to follow we

866
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
have to be a guardian we of course we

867
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,480
have to protect the assets we are the

868
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,599
representative within our organizations

869
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,599
that is tasked with and paid

870
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,180
to protect that business so that will

871
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,220
always be there but how do we do that

872
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,680
well we have to be a strategist we have

873
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,740
to help work with the business to build

874
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,520
a strategy we can't just wing it as we

875
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,579
go through our our careers we have to

876
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,040
really have a mindful of what needs to

877
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,920
be done how I'm going to get there

878
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,839
we have to be an advisor to the business

879
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,720
we have to help them understand where

880
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,380
security fits in their road maps we have

881
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,040
to help them understand that security

882
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,280
isn't a a crossing guard or a border

883
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,579
stop but it still needs them to work

884
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,240
with us in order to accomplish what they

885
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,180
want to do but at the same time do it in

886
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,400
a safe way and of course we have to be a

887
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,040
technologist Technologies out there we

888
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,720
can't be good cyber leaders without

889
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,740
Technologies I can be a very practical

890
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,140
cyber leader and have a lot of process

891
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,079
and hire some great people but without

892
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,540
that technology it's going to be very

893
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,579
difficult

894
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,320
so trust trust is something I've

895
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,079
mentioned a lot it really is the

896
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,720
fundamental piece that we all need to be

897
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,720
considering when we work trust really is

898
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,160
that peace

899
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,339
that represents what we know who we are

900
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:40,500
and helps us Define who do we trust why

901
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,560
should people trust us and really what

902
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,839
is built into our ability to to use

903
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,119
trust as a model to help protect our

904
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,660
organizations

905
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,740
when I was a paramedic as I mentioned I

906
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,140
worked on the front lines

907
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,700
um

908
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,980
typically two people

909
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,400
um in in a in a vehicle like this

910
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,160
um there were a lot of times where I

911
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,680
would go to some very serious scenes or

912
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,599
some very sick people

913
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,320
and family members uh patients would

914
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,960
trust me they had to trust me I was the

915
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,079
possible person that potentially

916
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,720
could keep them alive if they were

917
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,640
injured or if they were seriously sick

918
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,579
but I had a partner I had to trust my

919
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,740
partner but I learned through my career

920
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,359
that even though there were two of us

921
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,300
working in an ambulance

922
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,119
there were many many people around us I

923
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,000
wasn't the only person working that

924
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,040
could help the situation or help this

925
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,960
sick or injured person

926
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,839
I had firefighters by my side I had

927
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,780
police officers protecting the scene I

928
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,880
had other paramedics that were working

929
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,180
with us and when we got to the hospital

930
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,599
there'd be a team ready if necessary to

931
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,060
take over and continue that level of

932
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,859
trust

933
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,859
there never really was a time in the

934
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,980
grand scheme where

935
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,020
um I was alone and that was trust then

936
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,900
that I would transfer from the patients

937
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,040
trusting me to me then trusting others

938
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,540
uh to be able to fulfill those things

939
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,940
and that stuck with me as I entered into

940
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,359
my cyber security world we have to trust

941
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,880
people we have to understand who to

942
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,220
trust and who not to trust in our

943
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,520
journey

944
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,720
so the last couple points I want to make

945
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,940
today

946
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,280
is really to help decode what have I

947
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
ultimately learned in my career that has

948
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,160
helped me succeed in not only being a a

949
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,740
great practitioner in cyber security but

950
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,359
it's helped me fundamentally help the

951
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,900
organizations based on on

952
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,000
um all the pieces that I learned through

953
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,380
my career

954
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,200
so first off we have to embed cyber into

955
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,619
the fabric of our business process we

956
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,660
can't just do things like cyber

957
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,940
awareness or cyber training we can't

958
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,880
just go out and buy a new firewall

959
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,839
we have to have a mindset and a fabric

960
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,920
and a culture where cyber security goes

961
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,760
from just doing things to being cyber

962
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,859
okay we need our organizations not to

963
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:31,740
check the box when we come by with the

964
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,099
need to take their annual cyber security

965
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,599
training

966
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,660
we need them to be part of it and so as

967
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,339
a CSO we kind of look at a few different

968
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,980
models first off and always will be

969
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,500
there is the Tactical model right best

970
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,480
efforts something happens we're being

971
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,599
slammed by an attack or or a denial of

972
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,940
service attack we have to be somewhat

973
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,619
tactical we have to deal with it the

974
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:59,119
problem is there right now

975
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,000
um

976
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,300
We As Leaders want to have a model of

977
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,700
Champions we talked about it we're never

978
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,040
alone you're never alone

979
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,319
so we have to work to build those

980
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,319
Champions with us we have to trust

981
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,380
others within our organization obviously

982
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,720
our team if we have one

983
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
but cyber security isn't just about

984
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,280
yourself and the team directly around

985
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,680
you it is about those within the

986
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,740
organization and so we have to build

987
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,720
Champions within our companies to help

988
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
us accomplish that

989
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,520
we have to embed security and security

990
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,980
minded people in we have to build

991
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,560
leaders and we heard about it in the in

992
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,500
the panel uh right before me we can't

993
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,060
sit there waiting for that perfect

994
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,680
person to come to us to be able to uh be

995
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,380
that perfect analyst that we want to

996
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,400
hire

997
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,740
a they're probably already spoken for

998
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,200
and B we might not be able to afford

999
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,359
them we have to

1000
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,300
find our cyber leaders from within we

1001
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,119
have to bring Talent train them on the

1002
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,300
job they may not be the perfect fit but

1003
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,800
everyone has a bit of cyber security

1004
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,440
capability within them and we have to

1005
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,960
utilize that capability whether it be

1006
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,380
internally or people that are great to

1007
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,300
have in our organization

1008
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,819
um but maybe aren't the perfect ideal

1009
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,140
candidate

1010
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,300
and we have to be leaders of

1011
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,900
participation we have to be leaders that

1012
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,240
are not afraid to roll up our sleeves

1013
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,980
not be afraid to get engaged and do

1014
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,260
things ourself I was very much an

1015
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,020
operational CSO yes I put my coding days

1016
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,660
behind me and no I wasn't the guy you

1017
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,339
know analyzing all the logs on the

1018
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,740
firewall

1019
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,540
but I learned that I couldn't just be a

1020
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,099
tactical leader I had to be an

1021
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,319
operational one as well

1022
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,200
we have to educate our Workforce we have

1023
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,160
to not only educate our team but educate

1024
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,040
obviously the whole company everybody

1025
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,220
has to learn about cyber security uh and

1026
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,500
learning never ends it's not a one and

1027
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,619
done

1028
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,079
I I this past January I went back to

1029
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,880
school I'm going to get a master's

1030
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,560
degree in law in in Cyber Law

1031
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,380
um you never are too old or too late in

1032
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,300
your careers to learn

1033
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,960
that knowledge and that message

1034
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,540
resonates and it helps as a leader for

1035
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,760
you to you know ensure that your

1036
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,040
Workforce as I said and your company is

1037
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,260
learning in the right direction

1038
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,160
we need to share the strategies uh that

1039
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,380
we want in our visions of what we want

1040
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,119
to do with the company we don't want to

1041
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,740
keep it nestled in our own little corner

1042
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,140
we want to have a mission we want to

1043
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,819
have a road map and we want to share

1044
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:59,160
that with the organization not only our

1045
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,359
own leaders

1046
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,480
uh but with senior leaders and with the

1047
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,040
board and I would get in front of boards

1048
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,359
many times explaining the whys the hows

1049
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,300
the when's and the what ifs

1050
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,640
okay you need to be able to have that

1051
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,099
strategy and figure out it can change I

1052
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,300
can tell you I've wrote many many

1053
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
five-year road maps that I struggle to

1054
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,380
get out of year two before it was

1055
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,960
already uh old and needed to be changed

1056
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,640
and top priorities were crossed out and

1057
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,800
new ones were put in but you still have

1058
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,599
to work on that

1059
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,400
we have to build a risk intelligent

1060
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,700
culture we have to think about risk it

1061
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,220
isn't all about

1062
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,420
whack-a-mole and stopping something that

1063
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,460
happens here we have to understand the

1064
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,440
risk to an organization what will happen

1065
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,079
if our website goes down what will

1066
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,619
happen if our our customers and our

1067
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,339
company cannot procure uh things online

1068
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,200
because that's our whole business model

1069
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,220
what if our data is stolen from us so we

1070
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,500
have to understand what that risk is and

1071
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,660
we have to ensure that the leaders

1072
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,839
understand that as well

1073
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,720
and finally we have to be a

1074
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,660
a company that just doesn't work on

1075
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,140
reactivity we have to be moving from a

1076
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,020
reactive company to a proactive company

1077
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,480
training educating putting in the tools

1078
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,359
being prepared having a plan

1079
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,460
and ultimately we want to be a resilient

1080
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,440
company that's where we want to be we

1081
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,680
want to be resilient so we can reduce

1082
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,240
the likelihood and reduce the risk

1083
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,760
so in closing are we in the world of the

1084
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,440
rise of the Machines in Judgment Day

1085
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,140
just like in Terminator maybe one day we

1086
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,319
are today we're not

1087
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,000
uh we'll talk in 10 years and see where

1088
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,960
we are

1089
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,240
but as Leaders we need to take some of

1090
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,619
those qualities

1091
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,660
qualities that I've learned that I'm

1092
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,160
sharing with you today

1093
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,160
to help us be better at what we do in

1094
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,780
our own jobs uh better at helping our

1095
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,520
organizations and being prepared to do

1096
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,760
what we need to do in order to follow

1097
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,680
that definition of what cyber security

1098
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,560
is all about

1099
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,040
you know trust is uh Eric Schmidt who

1100
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,140
was the chairman of Google many years

1101
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,700
ago came up with this quote in a

1102
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,380
networked World trust is the most

1103
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,560
important currency I totally agree

1104
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,660
you know we have to

1105
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,720
be trusted ourselves as Leaders we have

1106
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,359
to trust others we have to decide who we

1107
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:39,839
don't trust in this world but so much of

1108
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,940
it hinges around making those

1109
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,280
determinations of where that trust

1110
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,800
should be and not be and we have to not

1111
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,920
be afraid to put out that trust where we

1112
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,119
need to and and be prepared to deal with

1113
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,839
the issues that come from from a breach

1114
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,480
of trust from a lack of trust and from

1115
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,119
over Trust

1116
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,020
and that's it thanks very much

1117
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:15,240
[Applause]

1118
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,540
no questions no awesome see we got on

1119
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,819
time people are ready for

1120
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:24,240
closing ceremonies and the next steps

1121
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,120
thank you very much

1122
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,569
[Applause]
