1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,639
hey everybody

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,780
um thanks for joining us thanks for the

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,100
after lunch attendance that's really

5
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,060
good

6
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,940
um I was told you know monotone really

7
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,280
slow speech and the first head to nod

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,840
first of all his head goes like this

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,160
buys the drinks tonight that's the deal

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,020
right and it won't be mine I can promise

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,580
you so that's good

12
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,020
um yeah so thanks a lot I'm going to

13
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,240
talk about demystifying zero trust

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,880
so just briefly talk a little bit about

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,380
zero trust

16
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,760
um kind of start with what it's not

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,859
because that's the easiest bit then I'll

18
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,760
get into a little bit of the history

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,560
right not a lot of people have a great

20
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,300
awareness of how far back this this

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,700
concept goes I'll talk briefly about the

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,860
history talk about some of the near-term

23
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
2018 at least in terms of nist and what

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,300
they've put together and where that is

25
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,899
um

26
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,899
and then from there get into

27
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,460
kind of the practitioners or The

28
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,140
Operators perspective in terms of you

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,460
know how do we approach what do we do

30
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,840
what is what is you know what are the

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,120
basis of of how we go forward

32
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
I'll talk through

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
the mindset you want to apply and you

34
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,340
know to the modeling and the structure

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,100
and then finish off with reassessment

36
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
it's you know zero trust is not a thing

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,459
of like I'm gonna go to the store I'm

38
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,840
gonna go to the rack I'm going to buy

39
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
pink zero trust I'm going to install

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,900
this thing and we're magic it's done I'm

41
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,640
going to go to the board get my bonus

42
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,619
and everything's wonderful absolutely

43
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,820
not the case

44
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,200
zero trust is an ongoing Journey so

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
trust is a vulnerability it's dangerous

46
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,880
right so it's exploited and it has

47
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,380
always been exploited

48
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,020
um I happen to find an old snippet that

49
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,960
I'd recorded 28 odd years ago which is

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,420
an old CSI FBI search

51
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,700
document that was produced way back then

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,100
28 years ago and at the time it was

53
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,259
found that Insider threat was the

54
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,659
greatest the greatest issue of the time

55
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,640
right so the concept of identity of who

56
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,020
these people are what they do within our

57
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,540
infrastructure is at that stage was very

58
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,399
nice and like it was it was it was very

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
simplistic stuff and that was obviously

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
part of the problem so there's some key

61
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,619
underpinnings that go with that I'm

62
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,180
going to talk about

63
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,979
activity Ministries activity how we

64
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,360
model for it how we we're going to work

65
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,399
away from that and do it in a way that's

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,680
measurable and attainable right because

67
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,719
one of the things that happens

68
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,000
it was just talking about zero trust and

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
there's a lot of confusion in the

70
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,120
industry and a lot of confusion in the

71
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
market right there's people that do

72
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
products that they claim on zero trust

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,580
capable there are people that do

74
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,140
services that are zero trust capable

75
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,720
there are people that do combinations of

76
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
these and you've got to be really

77
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
careful about what you're taking on here

78
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
so let's get into this

79
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,440
identity and access management and

80
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,120
outstanding practice an absolute

81
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,500
Cornerstone of our industry and what we

82
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,640
need to do

83
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,180
but as a statement this is identity

84
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,640
Nexus management is not zero trust right

85
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,580
it is a contributor to the state that

86
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,260
informs the model which will get us to

87
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,640
where we need to be with us but this is

88
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,019
not the singular piece that gets us

89
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,819
there right so just sit this sit the

90
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,260
table on that

91
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,360
zero trust network access tremendously

92
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,319
interesting

93
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,599
amazing groups of product Suites that

94
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,040
people have that will deliver these

95
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
types of functions for you and have a

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,900
very solid place in your structure and

97
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,300
in your thinking but this is not again

98
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,040
we don't buy as Etna and we have an

99
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,019
answer here right and in fact some of

100
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,340
the ztna that's out there is a little

101
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,140
bit aged and needs to be you know

102
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,420
updated so incorrect on that one

103
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,640
micro segmentation again tremendously

104
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
useful really you know functionally

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,580
where we need to be in terms of

106
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,720
adaptation and moving forward but

107
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,879
this also is not zero trust and then

108
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,340
finally zero trust is not a product I

109
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,480
mean I joke about it in terms of like

110
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
buying the pink one the green one the

111
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
red one you know if I pay more for the

112
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,620
red one is it better than the pink one

113
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,480
you know kind of mindset there's

114
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,800
unfortunately a lot of marketing has

115
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,599
glommed onto the xero trust principle

116
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,940
and concept and try to sweep a lot of

117
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,920
rubbish under the carpet on that one we

118
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,159
want to avoid all of that please and so

119
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,019
what it is

120
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,420
zero trust we go back to the Genesis so

121
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,920
Stephen Paul Marsh

122
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,239
and to make sure everyone's listening

123
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,319
I'm going to say at the Battle of

124
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,640
Sterling not the University of Sterling

125
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,659
because that always get to feed people

126
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,640
like whoa hang on where are we

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
um it's after lunchtime April 1994 in

128
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,360
his foundational paper

129
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,200
he introduced the concept of zero trust

130
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,620
um the Jericho forum is a following

131
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,659
2003 started talking about what was then

132
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,239
sort of categorized as deprimaturization

133
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,659
so the sense that our focused previously

134
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,399
on

135
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,798
hardening the inside with the moats and

136
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,720
keeps and all the the language we had at

137
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,960
the time for defensive circles around

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,820
our key infrastructure and key people in

139
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,100
key regions and resources with an

140
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,020
outward view started changing quite

141
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,460
significantly even that back then so

142
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
that's 20 years ago

143
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,340
people started really practically

144
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,720
thinking about how this is going to work

145
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
and go and here we are 20 years later

146
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
with a very confusing landscape with the

147
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,600
zero trust thing being thrown about so

148
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,639
key thing there and I'll just reference

149
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,860
there D perimeters deep perimeterization

150
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,419
lovely if you could actually say it

151
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,820
which maybe put my teeth in

152
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,460
um is uh it was referenced in 2009 by

153
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Mark kedrich in a book called endpoint

154
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,680
security he's a San Diego based

155
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
researcher

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
did some original reading around this

157
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
stuff red poll stuff I was in put

158
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
together a book on on endpoint uh

159
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,380
security and he really he really got a

160
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,820
hold of this and really published quite

161
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,500
extensively from that

162
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,080
I would say from his work some more

163
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,800
stuff came forward including

164
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,900
2009 Google uh took its first stab at

165
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,940
actually deploying a parallel structure

166
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,340
called Beyond Corp which is a zero trust

167
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,419
Enterprise that they were building

168
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,699
experimenting and growing it continues

169
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,280
to grow it continues to evolve uh which

170
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
is key that's the this is an

171
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,060
evolutionary process this is not a we

172
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,620
start here we spend 100 million dollars

173
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,940
and we get to their kind of a thing this

174
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,680
is something that we'll ever be ongoing

175
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,479
whether it's a 10 exercise or 100

176
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,699
million dollar exercise is a process

177
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,220
with no end right ultimately

178
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,380
and then looking at that

179
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,940
the stuff that really started getting a

180
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,039
lot of comp a lot of attention

181
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,820
John kindevag with Forrester in uh 2010

182
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,740
he talks about the zero trust model and

183
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,639
he's the first person that really

184
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,100
codified the approach of like let's take

185
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,419
this thinking look at it from a

186
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,620
perspective of like how could you

187
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,240
Embrace this as a practical model that

188
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,580
people could use and go forward with and

189
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,639
so this 13 years ago was the start of

190
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,020
the conversation started really making

191
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,340
this a practical thing that people could

192
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,160
actually bite off on and understand and

193
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,539
so later on in the slides I'm going to

194
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,699
talk about how we approach zero trust

195
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm going to talk about kind of the five

196
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,120
core principles of what you want to do

197
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,740
I'll talk about the Kipling method in

198
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,060
terms of application and how you build

199
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,100
your policy around that

200
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,479
um I'm about to break out into the

201
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,220
nisting as well which is brief I'm not

202
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,080
going to go too deep on that

203
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
um

204
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,660
but all of that really leveraged off

205
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,180
John's Key work John is still very much

206
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,819
active in the zero trust uh in the zero

207
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,979
trust world and he's now because of all

208
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,139
the marketing fluff that's going on is

209
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,539
actually sort of looking at rebranding

210
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,240
the zero trust approach as original zero

211
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919
trust or true zero trust

212
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,780
and the intent there is to be like my

213
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,340
carpet sweeper that is being sold as a

214
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,560
zero trust devices rubbish this is

215
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,699
actually what you need to be having to

216
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,660
think about

217
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,460
uh he's a hell of a character like if

218
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,720
you ever get to get him out he loves

219
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
racing he loves cowboy boots

220
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,500
um having him in Toronto in July for the

221
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,380
Indie race uh in a in a suede jacket and

222
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,199
cowboy boots in 28 degree heat is quite

223
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,840
fun good man to manage at that stage but

224
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,819
very smart operator

225
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,660
and uh I had mentioned the nist piece so

226
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,120
a little bit detailed but 2018

227
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,340
nist in their cyber the Cyber Excellence

228
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,900
group within that

229
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,020
published SP 800 207 and within that

230
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,220
they looked at a number of principles

231
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,660
and how you could actually Define them

232
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,979
and apply them so this is where we get

233
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,440
the first government look at putting

234
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,580
together something that would be then

235
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,259
generally available and broadly accepted

236
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,780
and documented and run and this is the

237
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,639
first piece of that I highlighted the

238
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,319
one that one piece there and that's

239
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,419
enforcing accurate per request access

240
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,560
decisions

241
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
right so again back to the identity

242
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
component identity is absolutely part of

243
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,900
what you need to be having there be it

244
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,819
for a resource a person or just a

245
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,919
function and then per request access

246
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,720
decisions need to be validated as we go

247
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,860
through this is a foundational thing

248
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,900
that we have there right I did reference

249
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,940
the paper for those that need it I'll

250
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,960
give you a minute if you need to have

251
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,220
that the slides I believe will be

252
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,419
available and there is a recording that

253
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,380
we'll have

254
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,940
that's absolutely well worth a read

255
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,500
right for anyone that's going to embrace

256
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,720
this approach start down this road or

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
even better pay a consultant to come in

258
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,599
and tell them what they should be doing

259
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,880
around this having a foundational read

260
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,500
in there building some understanding of

261
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,699
what's available what you should be

262
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,139
thinking of we'll introduce some

263
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,280
questions you might be able to put to

264
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,020
people like that and based on their

265
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,280
response you might be interviewing other

266
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Consultants or really embracing them and

267
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,280
welcome them into your organization to

268
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,800
do great things for you

269
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
I did promise to be a little bit

270
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
contentious but I was told to turn it

271
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,260
down so I hope we've been okay here

272
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,760
let's look to this

273
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
um a couple of key callouts are we going

274
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,820
to do the laser thingy

275
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,399
separation of control and data plane

276
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,120
right inputs so you know rediscovery

277
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,980
your engine for constant rediscovery and

278
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,260
constant inputs look at your policy

279
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,899
structure pki inputs ID management your

280
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,300
sim Etc but the breakout here is

281
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,240
separation control and data plane

282
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
select your input component process it

283
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,260
through something well that will take it

284
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,660
through a policy enforcement Point it'll

285
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,980
validate through policy and usually

286
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,600
through layers of policy and layers of

287
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,120
structure here to to give you a no no go

288
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,279
decision based on a go decision we can

289
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,899
then forward it on and have a sense of

290
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,660
of propriety very simplistic modeling

291
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,100
very simplistic look there's a great

292
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,080
deal of detail that goes into this but I

293
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,279
wanted this up there just specifically

294
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,600
because it calls out that separation

295
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
here

296
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,480
and in a practical sense why how you

297
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,680
would apply that

298
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
is again looking at you know what you

299
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
would commonly deal with in an

300
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,300
architecture perspective identity

301
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,519
structure and Source including you know

302
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,860
some sort of regionality Etc

303
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
device and workloads again regionality

304
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,640
where they're located what performance

305
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,140
what they perform for us and how they

306
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,880
operate whether they're calling to an

307
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
application or providing the application

308
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,140
Etc so data flows taking it into a

309
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,160
context there

310
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,399
what access type is required and then

311
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,440
transaction right so break that out into

312
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
the little chunks you can understand and

313
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,420
build on and go forward with that

314
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,040
so back to some of the original Concepts

315
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,480
and thinking there

316
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,459
the perimeter changed right so

317
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,860
originally we looked at our organization

318
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,560
as our piece with maybe some adjacent

319
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
satellite functions that we have secured

320
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,279
Etc but we have we have these pieces

321
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,620
that we secured and with time and

322
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,880
especially you know the last three years

323
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,140
with what happened with work from home

324
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,420
and and the and coven the pandemic

325
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,519
things change dramatically and so what

326
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm just going to paint this out

327
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,360
what we have now is essentially a

328
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,860
function that's that is required and

329
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,060
available everywhere users are

330
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,560
everywhere applications are everywhere

331
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,720
our control of infrastructure has

332
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,459
changed dramatically

333
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,140
and so with that we've had to change the

334
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,760
architectures change our approaches to

335
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,339
meet these you know requirements

336
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,880
concerns and objectives through there so

337
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,519
this is a simple example my context

338
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,959
within the company that I happen to work

339
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,180
for is I'm actually 14 different devices

340
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,339
within their infrastructure

341
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,540
and so they need to have an

342
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,459
understanding of like what is this

343
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,440
user's identification what certificates

344
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,880
are on those devices

345
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,620
what state is the device in terms of

346
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,180
security posture like what is applied

347
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,459
within there what controls are in play

348
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,320
et cetera Etc and based on the the you

349
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,459
know the communication of all those

350
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,380
things to a control point to that

351
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,560
decision piece to the policy structure I

352
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,940
would be granted access to things either

353
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,700
intern or external to the organization

354
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,800
in accordance with making sure that you

355
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,880
know from a zero trust perspective

356
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
making sure that policy is applied

357
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,779
correctly and so

358
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,279
again

359
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,380
internal users work no matter where they

360
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,700
operate from internal of course being

361
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,200
the old way of thinking Partners

362
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,240
contractors work from home people Etc

363
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,339
all of this is in context all of this is

364
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,440
in scope more and more the data center

365
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,820
is actually collapsing and moving away

366
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,100
right so I work in Canada quite

367
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,200
extensively most the banks there have

368
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,779
had significant you know collapsing and

369
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:46,980
shrinking of data data center

370
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,380
functionality and Personnel in favor of

371
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,000
cloud functions more and more

372
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,399
applications of course are directly you

373
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,600
know accessible outside of the

374
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
organization anyway current count and

375
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,040
just a quick interest point

376
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,320
SAS applications does anyone want to

377
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,180
have a guess or does anyone have a sense

378
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,060
of how many SAS applications are viably

379
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,300
commercially available to you today

380
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,980
someone's thrown a number

381
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,160
oh

382
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,459
three thousand

383
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,279
ten

384
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,399
it's so commercially available there are

385
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,560
there are entities so if you include

386
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
China in what's available then you're

387
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,920
probably in that region and what we

388
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,300
recognize in most of the western world

389
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,579
is about 58 000

390
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,860
unique SAS applications that you could

391
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,300
potentially interact with and your users

392
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,860
could potentially be using right or you

393
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,820
could potentially be providing the

394
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,800
services through and leveraging as part

395
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
of your Enterprise scope so from a zero

396
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,579
trust perspective that's a lot to take

397
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,160
in that is not a human issue at that

398
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,660
point I am not going to be sitting down

399
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,700
at a device

400
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,920
going through and maintaining currency

401
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,139
on 58 000 applications that are growing

402
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,899
at about 5000 applications every quarter

403
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,339
to keep any sense of scope or

404
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,600
understanding of what's going on in it

405
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,220
this is a machine issue

406
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,720
right so here's one of the Practical

407
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,339
intersections if anyone was here last

408
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,240
year when I talked about machine

409
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,940
learning for the sock here this is now

410
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,079
in you know on the front end of the

411
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,339
house practical application machine

412
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,500
learning and AI in terms of making the

413
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,959
Discrimination for you on what is going

414
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,360
on in that scope right

415
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
and so

416
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,500
when we look at the old

417
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,519
Define perimeter it was physical

418
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,260
flat Network and I'm going to paint this

419
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,339
out and then obviously talk about the

420
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,120
other

421
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,040
static policy so things that we would

422
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,300
potentially apply and then never think

423
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,320
about again

424
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
like I commonly go into environments

425
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,079
where I'm talking to people about their

426
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,820
architectures and I said damn this is a

427
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,560
and I say like

428
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,420
you know paint paint for your Landscapes

429
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,220
tell me where the applications are tell

430
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,139
me where your users are what cloud

431
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,519
infrastructures you use what's in the

432
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
data centers how do we use these things

433
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
what are the data flows let's understand

434
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,100
your business and how things go

435
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,480
and they'll paint this picture of how

436
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
things are and what have you and part of

437
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,060
what will come out of that

438
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,600
is there is inevitably

439
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,660
device or device is within their

440
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,860
infrastructures

441
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,959
that have been there for decades that

442
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,760
nobody can touch

443
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,279
just in case something ever happens on

444
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,779
that device right the policy that was

445
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,760
set there way back in the day like it

446
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,920
might be an old checkpoint you know 3ob

447
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,519
firewall from 25 years ago but we know

448
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,800
that that's the Caribbean banking arm

449
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
they send us once a quarter they send us

450
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,980
this little blip of communication which

451
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,779
is you know goes to that specific back

452
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,060
office guy in legal

453
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,620
don't touch it it's the only way we can

454
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,240
work it we think it's secure we kind of

455
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,500
hope it's secure the Auditors can't even

456
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,760
tell us if it's secure but like just

457
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,139
leave it that's where you get into

458
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,579
static policy and stupidities around

459
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,380
that kind of thing that has to change

460
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,120
obviously

461
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,920
uh and then generally they're network

462
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,540
based and network-based because we own

463
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,860
the networks we own the infrastructures

464
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,360
that we could kind of get our arms

465
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,100
around the interconnect points were

466
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,720
obviously commercially done through mpls

467
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,180
or you know direct connections all t1s

468
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,740
Etc back in the day

469
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,320
and so the new is more Concepts like

470
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,940
logical perimeter right we don't own the

471
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,019
infrastructure we don't know where

472
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,420
things are we own function we're on

473
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,720
outputs we own applications right and we

474
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,980
contract these things and they're

475
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,220
they're amazing and I'm really hoping we

476
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,540
kind of secure those really well because

477
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,980
sometimes we miss on that as well and

478
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,959
people really do

479
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,060
um we segment the next so segmented

480
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,920
networks these days there's not the

481
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,000
concept of like you know the old

482
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
pictures you see of like untrust

483
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,740
firewall trust but that's 25 years ago

484
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,060
as a model that's even 20 years ago's

485
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,839
model

486
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,000
but again referencing back to 19 you

487
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,260
know 1993 oh sorry 2003 thinking changed

488
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,300
deep perimeterization 2009 really

489
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,639
started catching hold 2010 John's paper

490
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,139
this is one of the most significant

491
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,579
things is the segmenting of the network

492
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,260
into function

493
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,240
right it's not region now now it's

494
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,860
function where it's like this is the HR

495
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,540
Network and this is the legal Network

496
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,920
and here's my you know Payment

497
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,720
Processing Network Etc and you start

498
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,519
logically breaking these things up by

499
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,800
functioning form which is far simple as

500
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
obviously to to secure from a zero trust

501
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,980
perspective

502
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,680
Dynamic policy and again static policy

503
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,440
this person going to that thing for this

504
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,540
you know for these reasons

505
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,699
with these Security checks great

506
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,860
never never think about it again

507
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,740
rubbish Dynamic policy these group of

508
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,100
ips right Office 365 these group of ips

509
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,260
I will give my people access to these

510
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,220
things

511
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,680
and if they access those I will I would

512
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,480
expect from them these inputs right or

513
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,579
this user ID these certificates these

514
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,560
checks on the inside checks behind the

515
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,060
policy you know before the policy is

516
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,279
applied and that can be dynamic so as

517
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,139
their state changes as the IPS

518
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,459
themselves that we're getting service

519
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,980
from change Etc we don't have to stop

520
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,420
the process we'd have to reinitiate a

521
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,680
connection we can actually adjust for

522
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,300
these things and go forward and log

523
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,519
those things which is useful

524
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,680
more of a context-based mindset for my

525
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,699
security

526
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,639
so very specifically think about this in

527
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,079
terms of like not ports and protocols

528
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,600
but layer 7. so John kinderberg last

529
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,339
year at cx-22

530
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,199
got up on stage about four minutes about

531
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,660
zero trust the most important message on

532
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,880
those four minutes was zero trust

533
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,619
requires

534
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,780
application Level security it's a layer

535
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,160
7 construct

536
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,959
if you do import some protocols in

537
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,939
whatever form you will never know

538
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,439
exactly what the applications are that

539
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,000
are processing through those and they

540
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,679
can be obfuscated and they can change in

541
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,000
you know they can flux while they're

542
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,619
processing and you're just blind to that

543
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,119
it has to so there's context within

544
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,160
there this is also context in terms of

545
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,140
the data in flow

546
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,699
so I'll talk briefly about single pass

547
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,079
architecture but essentially what I'm

548
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,840
saying is within your security controls

549
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,340
is the ability to look at the stream of

550
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,780
what's going through and make

551
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,160
determinations of what's on the Fly

552
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,200
there not just what's at race but also

553
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
what's on the Fly and what's in motion

554
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,539
for you

555
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,000
class Cloud host success I've already

556
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,380
spoken a little bit about that but just

557
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,460
in thinking there in terms of like

558
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,020
volume

559
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
um pretty much everyone I talked to

560
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,799
these days has SAS in in great volumes

561
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,600
and can't get away from that

562
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,940
and then lastly the new sort of thinking

563
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,039
is more of a prevention room to the

564
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,960
mindset prevention first

565
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,100
right this is something that's been

566
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,080
around for at least 12 years people have

567
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,059
started thinking more about less about

568
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,320
here's my perimeter this is what I

569
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
defend I can see it so I know I'm safe

570
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,500
to more of like

571
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,320
if these things happen what are my

572
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,700
responses going to be and let's make

573
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,960
sure we have those in place that I don't

574
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
have to think about it at the time as

575
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,260
they happen it's automated it just

576
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,039
occurs right so xdr MDR type approaches

577
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,480
within that as well

578
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
so Architects has changed dramatically

579
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,380
and if you look at the landscape today

580
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,720
so I am remains

581
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,299
a key piece right so identity is

582
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,919
absolutely you know Central to

583
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,840
everything that we would do there a

584
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
concept of endpoint so for the device

585
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
itself not only what is the device what

586
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,960
certificates what validation or security

587
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,179
parameters could I check from there but

588
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,440
the state of the device itself is

589
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
tremendously useful

590
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
right so no matter how it's communicated

591
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,120
if it originates communication or it's

592
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,220
the responder having a sense of what's

593
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,299
there and what the state is is

594
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,400
tremendously helpful

595
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,840
having a sense of network security

596
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,820
obviously just generically within there

597
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,440
so my cloud and all the other connect

598
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,179
pieces within there put those two

599
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,440
together and kind of conflate them a

600
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
little bit for the way today's view is

601
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,679
you need to have a sense of all these

602
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,600
components and what we're breaking it

603
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,580
down to is what are the locations we

604
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,100
need to service from into

605
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,900
who are the users that will be that

606
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,220
these things will be applied for and

607
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,600
within that what are the subgroups of

608
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,500
users so you know again HR as an as an

609
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,840
operational function versus you know

610
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,940
Joey from HR with a specific function

611
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,200
right he's the

612
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
the employee helper or whatever

613
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,980
um

614
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,799
users as well in the context of

615
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,919
function and code potentially for some a

616
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,539
process that performs an output that is

617
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,080
uniquely identifiable as well uh iot and

618
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
devices as a function of that

619
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
applications themselves and referencing

620
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,500
to those obviously that's everything

621
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
these days

622
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,460
and then the iot piece and the ability

623
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,740
to recognize you know what devices

624
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,960
potentially would not be measurable as

625
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,880
from an endpoint perspective but still

626
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,460
form some part of our function and need

627
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,840
to be recorded and measured and

628
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,760
monitored very carefully as part of that

629
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,559
foreign

630
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,940
so each line is just another Point

631
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,960
product there's obviously a lot of

632
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,460
confusion there's a lot of meshing of of

633
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,320
information flows within here that's

634
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,700
where architecture these days is so

635
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,340
important it's critical to understand

636
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,240
everything that communicates to

637
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,039
everything else what the flows on Etc

638
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,419
and I'll paint that out in a minute here

639
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,640
and the last piece for this

640
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,320
those single point products is a zero

641
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120
trust entity like it's it's not a thing

642
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,860
it's it's it is a model it is an

643
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,080
approach that we have to consider here

644
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,260
so let's talk about the concept

645
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,780
so from the operator or the consumer's

646
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,400
perspective

647
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,039
focus on your business outcome so what

648
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,080
is it the business the business requires

649
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,000
right and is that static or is that

650
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,880
changing like as we as we as an entity

651
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,039
are we in flux are we developing are we

652
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,299
changing our things change you know

653
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,460
things changing for us

654
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,960
but what is going to be our competitive

655
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,240
competitive differentiators

656
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,059
again Canadian banking is an example

657
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,220
the cloud move is well done like people

658
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,100
started off typically a bit of an IBM

659
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,020
relationship to be safe but not really

660
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,820
you know we don't want our shareholders

661
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,320
and our users to be scared so we'll kind

662
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,940
of just quietly do some backup stuff in

663
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,100
there and then gcp AWS all the other

664
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,539
guys came online we started doing they

665
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,640
started doing more stuff and courage

666
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,440
grew they looked at their peers and

667
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
they're like yeah we can actually do

668
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,740
this stuff this can work data centers

669
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,960
then obviously start shrinking trust

670
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
grows

671
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,520
with monitoring maintenance and you

672
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,600
start to look at like what are the

673
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,039
possibilities and then that becomes a

674
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,220
more of a strategic thing so focus on

675
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,659
the business outcomes what are the

676
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:37,980
business outcomes that are needed to be

677
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,179
achieved how do we get there

678
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,640
designed from the inside out

679
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,400
so still that mindset of

680
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,280
we control what we can see and touch

681
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,960
but it's no longer in our environment

682
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,539
this is now anywhere so if it's in the

683
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,159
cloud and we've got Cloud instances of

684
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,659
function and form that we're servicing

685
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:58,980
to other people

686
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,480
we have to have the design for the

687
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,919
inside out in terms of that cloud and

688
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,480
what it's going to do for us

689
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,039
so this is not within our scope within

690
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,360
our Network anymore this is now the new

691
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,620
world this is where we we need to be

692
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,120
thinking

693
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,460
determine who and what needs access

694
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,720
right so this is obviously just

695
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,080
simplified but again what's the device

696
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,120
where are they going

697
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,940
what level of application awareness are

698
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,799
we building into this thing and who is

699
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,080
the who's the entity requesting that and

700
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,179
of course inspect and log all traffic

701
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,799
so this is really simplistic there's a

702
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,000
very straightforward approach right now

703
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,520
if we get into the details some more

704
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,960
so

705
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
in terms of delivering this you've got

706
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,860
to have complete visibility

707
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,840
into what's going on so if you've got

708
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,280
stuff that's being tunneled through your

709
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
infrastructures and you don't know about

710
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,100
it or you've got stuff that's an

711
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,240
encrypted drive that you don't have

712
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,559
access to

713
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,179
right or your users are performing

714
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,559
function with SAS apps that are

715
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,820
encrypted that are outside of the scope

716
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,000
of what you can maintain and run

717
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,440
you're blind to these things well you

718
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,940
cannot see you cannot check right you

719
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,039
can't validate so complete visibility

720
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,080
into all traffic

721
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,240
again using context so Dynamic policy

722
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,039
requires context it requires the context

723
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,539
of what is the application what are the

724
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,980
sub applications that could be called

725
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,720
within that application what other

726
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,360
applications maybe spawned recognized or

727
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,340
information drawn from

728
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,960
you know

729
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,880
um and then beyond that automating so

730
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,039
automate the integrated sorry automated

731
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,740
and integrated

732
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,880
complete threat prevention capabilities

733
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,280
within here automation again just to be

734
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,360
able to deal with the scale of things

735
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,500
that you see today

736
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
for those of you here last year I spoke

737
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,100
at the time of you know stock Automation

738
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,299
and where that was going and what's

739
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,159
what's happening within that the

740
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,200
referencing back then I was talking in

741
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
the order of about 12 to 15 billion

742
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,500
events a month

743
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,600
just what we see currently is about 59

744
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,280
so about 5X

745
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,140
and if you can't automate that and you

746
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,299
can't use your automation to handle that

747
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,440
stuff for you you just never you're

748
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,059
never going to win you can't put people

749
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,460
at that process alone cannot do that for

750
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,080
you it is it is technology and

751
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,460
automation that will do that for you

752
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,200
then applies within your threat to

753
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
landscape as well so the volume of

754
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,799
threats what you have to face and how

755
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,059
you have to deal with that is such that

756
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,440
you have to have automation as part of

757
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,539
your approach and so to dig into these

758
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,000
just briefly

759
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,280
complete visibility so decryption is

760
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,320
decryption and inspection absolutely

761
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,460
critical

762
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,380
you cannot embrace the zero trust

763
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,940
mindset and build a model and get into

764
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,780
this if you're not going to be

765
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,039
decrypting

766
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,140
so just quick show of hands in this room

767
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,299
by your awareness

768
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,460
is everyone decrypting everything they

769
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,059
possibly can

770
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,980
any hands at all

771
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,960
not one

772
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,360
right wow

773
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,580
is anyone not decrypting because they

774
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,380
deal with Microsoft stuff like print

775
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,940
certificates

776
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,500
or

777
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,539
services that Transit their Network for

778
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,220
proprietary encryption

779
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,020
or is this just like a this is a thing

780
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,400
of will of like no we don't want to

781
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,419
touch this stuff

782
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,620
you know

783
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,419
common common issues around decrypt

784
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,340
would come into things like personal

785
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,200
medical information

786
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,120
you know in some in some jurisdictions

787
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,220
as well it's a human rights conversation

788
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,840
France Germany some parts of Canada

789
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
where

790
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,500
we can't decrypt stuff because it's very

791
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,720
specific to the user and the user is a

792
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,820
you know as a human entity has very

793
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,919
specific protections around them so we

794
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,360
can do stuff within the business context

795
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,860
for some things

796
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,659
but not for their own personal stuff so

797
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,679
their health records their own

798
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,440
financials Etc are completely to move so

799
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
what that requires is if you're going to

800
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,960
decrypt you have to have a very strong

801
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
sense of what exactly is the application

802
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,620
and where is that application reaching

803
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,539
to and what is it Servicing

804
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,820
so again if you don't have that you

805
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,279
can't even start this process right so

806
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,159
it's a bit of a catch-22 but key message

807
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,840
you've got to be able to decrypt you've

808
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,279
got to be able to do it efficiently in

809
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
an automated fashion as much as you

810
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
possibly can

811
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,299
context again John's words himself

812
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,419
zero trust approach the zero trust model

813
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,860
requires layer 7 policy enforcement

814
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,480
because you have to be able to identify

815
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
the application the core app all the sub

816
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,039
apps that would spawn and be able to

817
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,860
build policy such that you would say we

818
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,539
don't like Facebook based but we like

819
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,220
Facebook Messenger but yes we're not

820
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,659
going to allow uploading of information

821
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,100
from Facebook Messenger we'll only

822
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,720
download or whatever your whatever

823
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,279
context would be that you'd need to

824
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,140
apply that's what you would then build

825
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,400
from here

826
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,020
and again on the threat protection side

827
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,840
take that prevention first approach

828
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,580
right so if we see something we know

829
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,140
it's a problem and it's been seen

830
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,640
somewhere else and it's validated let's

831
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,919
not let's not do it

832
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,480
you know just simple context there like

833
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,340
let's take a DNS example

834
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,840
while users reaching out to something

835
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,840
spawns a DNS request DNS request goes

836
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,299
out my resolver goes oh

837
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,400
I spoke to the DNS security thing right

838
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
here I said a millisecond ago and we've

839
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,240
seen that somewhere else and that was a

840
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,860
malicious domain serving ransomware

841
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,900
let's cut that communication off and

842
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,799
start again

843
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,539
notify the user maybe if you want to but

844
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,799
otherwise just cut that stuff off and

845
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,659
let's carry on and so that prevention

846
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,460
first mindset the prevention first

847
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,980
approach comes into there

848
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,559
and of course ongoing monitoring is

849
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,059
absolutely critical again this is a

850
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,320
journey this is not we don't go from

851
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,840
here to there you know 0 to 60 and you

852
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,659
know 3.5 and then the job's done and we

853
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,820
get my bonus on bugger off this is all

854
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,520
about an ongoing practice right

855
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,200
and the single pass architecture is just

856
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
referencing the ability to make a group

857
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,880
of decisions in one flow so as we see

858
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
the stuff flow throughout you know

859
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,159
through the cloud through your

860
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,799
Technologies Etc that a decision can be

861
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
reached such that the policy is applied

862
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,980
once

863
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,320
because what will happen is if you

864
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,539
potentially have a firewall over here

865
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,980
that does this for me

866
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,720
and I've got a VPN technology over here

867
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,580
that does this for me and I've got a URL

868
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,020
filtering thing over here that does this

869
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,539
and here's my DNS stuff and there's my

870
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:40,860
cloud protection and there's the other

871
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,779
Cloud's projection and stuff's going to

872
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,159
Transit all of that as individual

873
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,200
decision points

874
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
contention is going to come into play

875
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,380
you're going to run into latency issues

876
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,520
you're going to run into problems in

877
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,020
terms of logging and monitoring and be

878
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,940
able to decipher with something went

879
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,700
wrong all right depending on what you

880
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,380
need to record and that can become an

881
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,779
issue for you so having it having a

882
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,340
policy structure having an architecture

883
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,779
that supports having a single policy

884
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,159
with a single logging Source if possible

885
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,240
be it whatever you're going to use on

886
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,620
the on the bottom end to collate this

887
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,360
information and give you a meaningful

888
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,320
output that's that's absolutely critical

889
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
so

890
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
a quick word on the learning curve

891
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,700
because obviously I'm talking about a

892
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,100
lot of broad stroke stuff here

893
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,700
let's get into this so

894
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,299
protect surface and you know the the

895
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,799
concept of like how difficult this will

896
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,720
be and how much time it would take

897
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,460
and so essentially how it's how we look

898
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,480
at this I'm just going to flick through

899
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,039
a little bit

900
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,200
as with everything we embrace the

901
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,299
concept we charge down the road we study

902
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,820
like mad up all night weeks on end

903
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,039
and we start figuring out what we need

904
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,260
to do and by the time we reach we reach

905
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,000
a stage where we're decent practitioners

906
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,380
with this it becomes fairly

907
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,020
straightforward almost automatic and we

908
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,100
usually then fall asleep at the switch

909
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,600
and some degree in kind of things might

910
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,159
fall off a bit that's not what we're

911
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,539
describing here that's not this phase

912
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,640
what I'm saying here is there will be an

913
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,779
initial phase where you'll start

914
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,980
defining

915
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,360
hey this sounds interesting that guy

916
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
spoke about this thing in the conference

917
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,820
we should really think about that how do

918
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,620
we go about it and that'll be this phase

919
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,840
here and it's literally this

920
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,460
we'll talk about protect surface as

921
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,840
essentially a function that you need to

922
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
protect from the pieces that I've

923
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,899
already spoken about and using the

924
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,640
pieces I've already spoken about

925
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
and what you'll have is you'll have a

926
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,059
learning phase we all say

927
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,279
why don't we start this out with X right

928
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,799
we're going to do this for

929
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,140
salesforce.com for Access for just

930
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,140
our sales group accessing that SAS app

931
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,700
here's what we're going to do we're

932
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,840
going to take that application we look

933
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,159
at the flows we'll build an architecture

934
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,659
that supports full security with zero

935
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,760
trust modeling and mindset to do this

936
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
and we might approach that from here and

937
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,480
work our way through that learn some

938
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,640
lessons we've got it cool

939
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,080
we've got that pinned down we're going

940
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,880
to go into on ongoing monitoring we will

941
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,380
come back and readjust as they adjust

942
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,120
and we adjust in terms of how we

943
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,799
resource it and how they Supply it

944
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,659
that's great and we'll move on to the

945
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,760
next and so you'll you'll go forward and

946
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,620
build a few you know build some scars

947
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,020
get some scars build a few experiences

948
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,559
and in time that will become something

949
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,360
of a practice right you'll sort of feel

950
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,860
comfortable like this feeling a bit bold

951
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,260
courage is strong the ball's padding on

952
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,539
the back of the head carry on

953
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,520
and what will happen in time is you will

954
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,940
then reach

955
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,559
the crown jewels right you'll get to the

956
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,460
stage where you're like I'm happy about

957
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,720
this stuff

958
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,159
the stuff I was really scared about that

959
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,659
nobody should ever touch because it'll

960
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,100
cause us trouble and that's a career

961
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,020
limiting move and a resume generating

962
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,539
event we will now take this on

963
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,940
and go forward and when that's

964
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,039
successful

965
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,220
then it just becomes sort of an ongoing

966
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,720
process to that point so this is almost

967
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,580
the excitement trajectory oh my God I

968
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,960
can't believe I'm actually doing this oh

969
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,220
my God I'm actually can't believe I'm

970
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,200
actually succeeding well let's take on

971
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
everything and then it's like yeah I'm

972
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,799
an old head at this I'm really just go

973
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,940
and work for one of the consultancies

974
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,559
and you know make make fortunes doing

975
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,720
this for someone else right

976
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,460
um sorry a little bit not cheeky I know

977
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,380
but it is what it is

978
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,039
um

979
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,779
this is kind of like the timeline this

980
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,520
is the obviously the expectation of the

981
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,080
hype cycle behind some of the stuff as

982
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
well I love this because it allows me to

983
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,279
be a little bit naughty with it but um

984
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
that really is how that approach starts

985
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,700
it's really just the learning phase to

986
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
begin with starter for something small

987
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,580
something that's manageable something

988
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,899
you think you understand because I'll

989
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,940
guarantee you that when you start down

990
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,080
the process of actually building the

991
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,360
architecture and looking at these things

992
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,799
things are going to come out of left and

993
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,299
right field that you have no idea about

994
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,740
that you're never even considered that

995
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,760
they're going to be a problem for you

996
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,559
absolutely they are and you can nod your

997
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,059
heads in acknowledgment at this point

998
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,679
things are going to happen that you had

999
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,360
no concept of that you need to be aware

1000
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,159
of and you'll have to be adaptable and

1001
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,140
jump on the Fly and make things happen

1002
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,240
those lessons

1003
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,360
even in here will inform the success of

1004
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,799
what comes later obviously this is just

1005
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,020
natural and so

1006
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,340
we like to talk about a five-step

1007
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,220
methodology for zero trust well

1008
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,960
Define the protect surface so again look

1009
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,100
at you know what is it I'm going to

1010
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,539
protect what is the architecture how are

1011
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:58,380
we going to draw these things together

1012
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,600
start thinking about

1013
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,480
the transaction flow

1014
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,700
where is this service from

1015
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,740
oh it's a cloud service

1016
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,559
okay what does that mean for me I'm on

1017
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,240
an island does this mean this is a New

1018
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,679
Jersey thing or is this a Jamaica thing

1019
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,760
for me like

1020
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,140
you know let's start thinking about this

1021
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,460
and start building up what does that

1022
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,679
mean how is it practically applicable to

1023
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,539
what we need to achieve here

1024
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,760
right look at the application flows in

1025
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,260
terms of who's reaching out to these

1026
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,640
replications

1027
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,260
and again how do we validate them the

1028
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,299
devices they're coming from are they

1029
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,799
operating in regions which we want them

1030
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,480
to operate from

1031
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,159
amazing example

1032
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,140
the whole Russia thing kicks off one of

1033
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,580
our biggest Partners our biggest Global

1034
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,159
partner gets hold of us and says we've

1035
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,340
got to be out of Russia in 90 days

1036
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,500
how the hell do we do that well because

1037
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,000
they're an architecture that was a zero

1038
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,039
trust modeled architecture we could very

1039
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,659
simply dynamically shut that down

1040
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,640
overnight

1041
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,140
kind of cool to be able to do that if

1042
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,340
you need to

1043
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,960
not an everyday kind of occurrence

1044
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,580
though but you know it's if it's well

1045
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,620
thought out it's very flexible

1046
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,960
so architecting the zero trust

1047
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,059
Network

1048
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,279
creating that zero trust policy

1049
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,140
right eliminating implicit trust as we

1050
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,940
go through all these processes and we

1051
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,779
start thinking about things

1052
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,000
and then lastly Monitor and maintain

1053
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,740
this is almost the most critical piece

1054
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,940
of it

1055
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,980
because you can build great stuff you

1056
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,419
can have an amazing thought you have

1057
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,059
brilliant teams put the stuff for you

1058
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,320
incredible Consultants come and validate

1059
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,820
that you've done amazing things the

1060
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,100
board can high five and if you're not

1061
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,080
keeping an eye on it something will

1062
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,580
change and you're going to land up with

1063
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,380
egg on your face invariably

1064
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,179
you look at the examples of the breaches

1065
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,559
that occur these days

1066
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,880
they're not occurring in places that

1067
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,019
have no protections they're not

1068
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,159
occurring places that aren't well

1069
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,980
consulted fully audited and everything

1070
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,940
else

1071
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,519
what's going on is environments where

1072
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,380
something slipped

1073
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,600
in terms of updates currency Etc and

1074
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
things weren't monitored and maintained

1075
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,620
the best example of this the best

1076
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,840
example is still what happened with

1077
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,240
Target Old example but just I love the

1078
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,360
fact that the alert is seen

1079
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,699
and the alert team in India notifies the

1080
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,219
guys and says well problem here

1081
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,960
and they're like yeah we're busy we'll

1082
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,760
get to that

1083
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,679
until it was too late

1084
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,139
right this is such a critical part of

1085
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,300
your zero trust approach I just can't I

1086
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,099
can't highlight that enough

1087
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,359
so

1088
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,119
that five-step methodology I'm going to

1089
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,320
really quickly go through just a couple

1090
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,699
of things now defining the protect

1091
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,020
surface and I want to paint this out as

1092
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,259
we go

1093
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,260
discover and classifier right what

1094
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,940
where's what data are we talking about

1095
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,699
what are my assets what assets do I own

1096
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,739
what are my partners own what have I

1097
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,020
contracted to in terms of assets as a

1098
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,119
service functionally what applications

1099
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,040
are we using and where are they

1100
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,020
what services do we use within those

1101
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,399
applications

1102
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,379
probably not using all of them

1103
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,660
you know unless you're paying Salesforce

1104
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,339
off a million bucks a month you wouldn't

1105
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,740
be using everything they offer so dig

1106
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,119
into what's what's available and

1107
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
functionally useful to you in there map

1108
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,619
the transaction flows right and where

1109
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,060
possible use an automated tool or

1110
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,220
tooling that'll paint some of this for

1111
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,720
you

1112
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,200
understand how data applications flow

1113
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,940
what systems they use networks they

1114
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,560
interact with so what are the connect

1115
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,420
points for all of those

1116
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,339
architecture zero trust Network right

1117
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,440
it's a segment

1118
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
ensure your enforcement points are

1119
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,560
enabled right with shared policy and

1120
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,900
consistent policy if it if possible so

1121
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
again consisting of policy across your

1122
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,500
entire infrastructure would be useful

1123
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
simplify your management and centralized

1124
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,320
management

1125
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,020
if if what you're looking at is you have

1126
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,480
a multi-vendor approach

1127
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,520
right defense and depth used to be

1128
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,240
called

1129
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,579
so I have an XYZ firewall and I have a

1130
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,980
ABC firewall and I keep those things

1131
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,599
separate and that's my you know that's

1132
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,700
maybe that's my Approach is that I'm

1133
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,780
gonna have these two things doing

1134
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,300
discrete function similar but discrete

1135
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,859
function and the intent is that if some

1136
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,900
things make it through a b is going to

1137
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,859
catch them

1138
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,940
there's still a lot of that going on

1139
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,160
it's still very much a legitimate

1140
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,740
approach as long as you

1141
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,020
to simplify your management or at least

1142
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,820
the logging maintenance and review of

1143
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,780
those things

1144
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,880
because if that's disparate systems that

1145
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,560
feed to disparate log structures or

1146
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,060
different you know and don't feed the

1147
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,859
Sim correctly

1148
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,300
it's just double your work at that point

1149
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
it's really not buying you an awful lot

1150
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,040
build an architecture with performance

1151
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,020
and scalability in mind

1152
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,760
to that end a lot of what we're talking

1153
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,320
about now in the North American context

1154
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,460
these days is very much a cloud

1155
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,839
conversation

1156
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,300
right for folks to host on-prem

1157
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,000
capability is just it's operation

1158
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,140
expensive

1159
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,060
you know in terms of overheads Etc

1160
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,339
maintenance currency it's just there's

1161
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,560
just too much involved it's far simpler

1162
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,700
these days for that just to be a cloud

1163
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,259
thing these days which is interesting

1164
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,160
create a zero trust policy and here I'm

1165
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,060
just going to go straight to the bottom

1166
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,040
the Kipling method is talking about the

1167
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,740
who what where when why and how right so

1168
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,960
if you look at those there the who an

1169
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,520
employee on the company managed asset

1170
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,920
great it's Gary on the corporate laptop

1171
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,079
on his MacBook

1172
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,060
what's going on he's accessing source

1173
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,900
code

1174
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,980
so

1175
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,540
subtext of what's happened there is

1176
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,640
because I'm accessing source code I've

1177
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,000
used OCTA so I've used my aad to log

1178
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,859
into my system I've used octo to log

1179
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,320
into a landing page and in this case

1180
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,880
I'll probably use ping ID to get to the

1181
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,900
source code

1182
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,660
right multi-factor validating each step

1183
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,619
of the way

1184
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,619
when normal working hours okay good

1185
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,000
where is he going he's going to our

1186
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
GitHub GitHub repository that's

1187
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
protected in some form right

1188
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,520
why is my job function business

1189
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,140
justification right this is part of my

1190
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,280
job that I need to be looking at that

1191
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,560
source code to validate how I could use

1192
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,680
that for my customers best benefits how

1193
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,480
full inspection and decryption so

1194
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,099
decrypting anything in terms of the flow

1195
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,420
to understand what I'm doing when and

1196
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,680
how

1197
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,400
um

1198
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,320
and to read and write the you know to

1199
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,420
see my read and write Privileges and at

1200
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,579
this point the action allow

1201
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,760
allow and record deny deny and record

1202
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,380
Etc right or just send a warning page

1203
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,000
like go away you don't have access to

1204
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,079
the system

1205
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,040
whatever it would be

1206
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,900
again Monitor and maintain continuous

1207
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300
monitoring continuously using that

1208
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,859
monitoring that output as an enhancement

1209
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,140
cycle again this is not a it's not a you

1210
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,820
know start to end thing there's a

1211
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,440
continuous Evolution and that's where we

1212
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,960
come to use security analytics to

1213
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,640
quickly identify a record and record

1214
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,280
threats and act on those and adjust your

1215
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,800
model accordingly don't just respond to

1216
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,420
the threat think that one day I'm going

1217
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,680
to get back to that just to patch that

1218
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,940
thing and rewrite that do it immediately

1219
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,800
and then lastly

1220
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,780
there's a wrap up here one of the most

1221
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,520
critical things about this is within

1222
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,040
this journey is as you process through

1223
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,740
that Discovery phase you know kind of

1224
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,660
being capable doing the crown jewels Etc

1225
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,640
as you embrace the Euro trust as a model

1226
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,619
as you Embrace this approach and you go

1227
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,780
through all of this please always keep

1228
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,920
in mind

1229
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,980
your view is biased by what you see and

1230
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,320
know there will always be people out

1231
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,660
there that can give you a third party

1232
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,060
view that obviously will have value in

1233
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,440
terms of their experiences within your

1234
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,820
industry your peers and wherever else

1235
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,680
they've been in scene they'll be able to

1236
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,300
give you a decent commentary on what

1237
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,540
they've seen so trust assessment I would

1238
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,300
argue has got to come from the outside

1239
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,160
right you have to have relationships

1240
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,599
with your Auditors and others that are

1241
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,460
going to come in are you going to be

1242
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,680
able to validate what you've taken on

1243
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,060
how you've approached it what it's doing

1244
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,040
for you and make sure that it's meeting

1245
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,900
all those criteria all the way through

1246
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,820
not just to logging and monitoring thing

1247
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,400
but literally all the way through so I

1248
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,160
want your assessors to come in

1249
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,980
look at how you do device ownership

1250
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,079
look at how you know your quarantine and

1251
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,160
check

1252
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,099
right location-based stuff

1253
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,079
your compliance checks within there on

1254
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,280
your user side application

1255
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,540
identification

1256
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,579
what actually you know how are you doing

1257
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,980
that your user identification what tree

1258
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,920
of of decision do you have for a primary

1259
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,859
user and enhanced user secure user Etc

1260
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:06,119
as you break through all those different

1261
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,980
things in I am

1262
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,500
um when trust decisions are made

1263
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,359
how short was the time frame on those

1264
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,619
and how do you revalidate that they're

1265
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,700
shut down

1266
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,020
all right just a simple thing some

1267
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,020
people Miss on the access control piece

1268
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,420
I basic access controls continuous

1269
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,920
monitoring and then trust level changes

1270
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,720
and again within here

1271
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,040
how do you account for these trustable

1272
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,780
changes as your applications shift and

1273
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,980
they might call information from other

1274
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,079
parts right so we've got we've got

1275
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,060
information going into a web form that's

1276
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,280
calling something in a database is that

1277
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,720
accounted for like make sure that that

1278
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,040
is part of your modeling and you've got

1279
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,960
that stuff covered

1280
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,579
so that is that is what I wanted to

1281
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,800
cover today that is the intent of it at

1282
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,000
this stage I'd welcome any questions

1283
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,579
please

1284
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,859
oh

1285
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,800
everyone's still awake that's damn good

1286
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,540
nobody's buying drinks then I guess

1287
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,779
sorry

1288
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,660
hi Gary hey um quick question so with um

1289
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,780
threat and Bad actors both internal and

1290
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,780
external yes obviously third party as

1291
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,099
you've mentioned

1292
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,800
um with zero trust security how can you

1293
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,960
ensure that your service provider can be

1294
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,720
trusted and if your service provider is

1295
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,180
protecting you who is protecting them

1296
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,800
what are your best practice

1297
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,200
recommendations in terms of backup to

1298
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,540
protect you and your business I love

1299
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,099
that so

1300
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,420
key thing about when you're talking

1301
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,920
about zero trust modeling is the

1302
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,359
modeling is not just for you and your

1303
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,280
entity and what you do it's also for

1304
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,839
anyone that provides you service anyone

1305
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,760
that provides you function it has to be

1306
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,900
applied equally within their

1307
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,520
infrastructures and you have to

1308
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,900
understand those things so just like the

1309
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,940
cloud relationship is a simple one it's

1310
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,079
like hey Google's giving me these

1311
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,700
functions that's great and they're

1312
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,140
telling me that they're C2 certified

1313
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,540
which is it's kind of nice to know but I

1314
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,920
don't really trust that what else can I

1315
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,480
you know what else can we talk about and

1316
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,560
at that point it's a discussion with

1317
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,119
your provider on what does that actually

1318
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,440
mean to you like where do you draw your

1319
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,900
personnel how are they validated how

1320
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,940
often can we review this with you do you

1321
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,560
report regularly and get into those

1322
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,960
things as well yeah it's critical and

1323
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,300
it's you any application any controls

1324
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,740
you apply internally you have to apply

1325
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,839
to them as well yeah and if if they

1326
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,980
don't then you can obviously put them

1327
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,380
into a categorization in terms of how

1328
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,420
they access things with you or through

1329
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,960
you that is severely restricted yeah is

1330
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,240
that cool thanks

1331
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,599
hi I I I wanna I want you to clarify

1332
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,960
your your comments on decryption yes

1333
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
um because I can I can see where if you

1334
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
decrypt everything

1335
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,280
that could be a lot of problems because

1336
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,740
what you're doing is that you are saying

1337
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,839
that you're providing an automatic

1338
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,920
mechanism

1339
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,800
uh for a back door and once a back door

1340
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,200
exists and people know that the back

1341
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,119
door exists

1342
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:00,780
um

1343
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,819
elements various governments around the

1344
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,800
world can ask for the back door that's a

1345
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,380
that's an excellent question and the

1346
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,000
answer there is that when I'm talking

1347
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,319
about decryption in this context I'm

1348
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,780
thinking about SSL TLS uh potentially

1349
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,940
ssh in in some function it's very

1350
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,920
limited but some people do that as well

1351
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,680
but it's intentional that we we decrypt

1352
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,140
in the single pass architecture so what

1353
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,240
happens is the decrypt happens when we

1354
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,099
do the insecurity inspection and it's

1355
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,980
re-encrypted in software in process in a

1356
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,540
secured module before it's passed out

1357
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,400
and the key thing is when you engineer

1358
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,079
that you have to engineer it in such a

1359
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,940
way that that module and everything and

1360
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,140
the memory that's used in that is

1361
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,300
separated from every other function yeah

1362
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,859
so it's not it's not completely Flawless

1363
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,140
there is still potential there but you

1364
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,760
reduce that as much as you possibly can

1365
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,420
so my final comment on that is just you

1366
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,079
know you have euba so if you have that

1367
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,579
in place you don't necessarily have to

1368
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,900
decrypt

1369
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,760
right the only reason why decrypts is

1370
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,700
essential yeah no so from the user

1371
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,960
Behavior perspective that's really

1372
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,119
useful and I'd agree with that as

1373
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,339
Principle as long as the as long as the

1374
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,079
you the application the user thinks

1375
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,579
they're using is that

1376
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,079
right if something's been compromised

1377
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,460
I'll give an example one of the Canadian

1378
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,619
universities phones me at 11 30 on a

1379
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,640
Sunday night

1380
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,140
and they say we've been hit by

1381
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,480
ransomware we've got 300 servers that

1382
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,800
are still up but everything else in the

1383
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,200
data centers hosed right so they still

1384
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,400
have function carrying on in the

1385
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,540
environment but now at this point they

1386
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,040
don't trust anything

1387
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,680
as they shouldn't at that point uaba

1388
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,540
would tell us what users are doing what

1389
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,859
behaviors are going on within there

1390
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,839
which is useful but we don't have an

1391
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,160
assurance of the applications they think

1392
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,079
they're using our sound and that's where

1393
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,760
the decrypt can come in and say exactly

1394
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,400
what it is and not so it's nuanced but

1395
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,819
it's useful

1396
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,300
yeah good uh yes sorry here he's looking

1397
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,740
at the back I'm sorry I was in the wrong

1398
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,660
blue shirt

1399
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,420
yeah this is a general question uh is

1400
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,339
there any case studies published that

1401
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,800
you would consider to be a best practice

1402
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,520
implementation of zero trust

1403
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,920
so

1404
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,500
I'll say the original 20 2010 white

1405
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,900
paper that Forester published in the

1406
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,339
sort of the principles of the model and

1407
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:12,420
how it should be applied is really

1408
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,940
useful that nist paper are referenced is

1409
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,099
very useful in terms of actually a more

1410
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:18,780
practical application of that yeah those

1411
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,460
are the two that I would say are of

1412
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,839
foundationally very good to start from

1413
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,759
because I know about a restaurant but

1414
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,819
you hear a lot about principles but

1415
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,040
the actual practical the actual

1416
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,380
practical implementation so the

1417
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,940
challenge there is if you think about

1418
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,319
the five things that I want to look at

1419
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,180
for building the model for you would be

1420
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,400
what is your application what are your

1421
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
users where are they how do we build

1422
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,119
that architecture around that specific

1423
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,300
instance so while there are anecdotal

1424
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,680
references to people that have built

1425
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,060
these models that are maintaining them

1426
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,800
whether that's good or bad is never is

1427
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,900
never published in the Articles yeah

1428
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,339
that's where I'd reference back to

1429
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,220
getting the verifications that yeah yeah

1430
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,260
it's kind of a weird it's a weird Sticky

1431
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,720
Thing for that I agree

1432
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,200
cool

1433
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,220
thanks very much everyone have a great

1434
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,399
day
