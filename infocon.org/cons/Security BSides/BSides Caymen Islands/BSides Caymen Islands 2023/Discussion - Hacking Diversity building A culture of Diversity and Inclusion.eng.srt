91
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,640
career I started in software development

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,099

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,860
they talk about things like chat GPT and

94
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,959
that being able to generate code well I

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,700
must say I'm delighted that I left

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
software development all those years ago

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
and I've I've done most of the jobs

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,379
along the system development life cycle

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,879

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519

cyber security but and now in this role

103
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,019

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,220
inclusion and diversity and I'm really

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,139
looking forward to this discussion thank

110
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:19,858
you

111
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,260
awesome so real quick if you have

112
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,360
questions just raise your hand there

113
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,860
will be time for those questions we will

114
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,660
be done by 11 so the next speaker can

115
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,360
come on and uh do their thing

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
um so let's just jump right in so um

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,120
Carlota what steps can companies take to

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,460
attract a diverse pool of candidates

119
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,139
uh I think they really need to believe

120
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,900
in it and uh I think what we saw in the

121
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,479
U.S in the the wake of the black lives

122
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,979
matter movement is you saw a lot of

123
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,380
companies jump on board and create

124
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,540
diversity diversity and inclusion

125
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,479
inclusion initiatives and positions and

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,460
that sort of thing but I think what was

127
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,919
kind of buried underneath because BLM

128
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,139
was such a and George Floyd were such

129
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,780
big headlines at the time at that same

130
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,880
time Forbes had come out with a bunch of

131
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,000
uh um several Business magazines came

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,620
out with a bunch of research saying that

133
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,020
uh companies that had diverse leadership

134
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,940
and diverse boards performed

135
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,280
significantly better than companies that

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,100
did not and I think that those two

137
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,800
things kind of hit at the same time

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,180
um and

139
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,660
for a large Enterprise it's very easy I

140
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,660
think to to create those spaces it's

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,699
much harder for those small

142
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,160
organizations for those those mom and

143
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,780
pop stores those sub 100 person

144
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,060
companies which is the majority of the

145
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,860
companies that maybe aren't hiring

146
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,479
security people necessarily right now

147
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,539
but will be in in time so

148
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,240
um somebody has to believe in it it if

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
it's a small organization the top has to

150
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,900
believe in it if it's a large

151
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,699
organization you can do a much more

152
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,500
Grassroots movement

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
how does that look here in the Cayman

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,919
Islands what do you guys what are you

155
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,000
guys seeing

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
yeah I think you know we're very

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,780
fortunate here in the Cayman Islands

158
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,360
that you know our diversity and

159
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,340
inclusion is really baked into the way

160
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,000
that uh you know we we recruit so that's

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
not to say that more couldn't be done

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,900
but but I do think we're very fortunate

163
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,080
here and and to Echo what's said earlier

164
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
um you know it's important for business

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,500
and and there are many studies that

166
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,479
demonstrate that you know I'm talking

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,100
about jurisdictions outside of the

168
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,340
Cayman where diversity and inclusion is

169
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,860
uh something that's valued and driven

170
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,000
through the organization the

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
organization performs better they're

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
positive and tangible outcomes But

173
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,539
ultimately it's about getting the the

174
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,660
best person for the job and so I look

175
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,160
forward to a day when we don't have to

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
talk about it in these terms and like I

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,940
said certainly for the Cayman Islands I

178
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,979
see a lot of diversity I see a lot of

179
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,039
inclusion more still to be done I

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
believe especially in cyber security

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,139
yeah and I'd I'd like to kind of oh

182
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,460
sorry okay no you you agree with Spam I

183
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,139
think we uh when we look at the

184
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,979
workforce we see the diversity both uh

185
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,900
on gender level and on the cultural

186
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,340
level you know that we're very

187
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,400
Multicultural Society and uh as he was

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,380
saying the diversity definitely brings

189
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,240
different perspectives to the table and

190
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,460
that helps organizations to be more

191
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,460
resilient in the end I think what um one

192
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,259
area that we

193
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,500
um could do batting is the education and

194
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,020
educating for instance young women that

195
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,539
cyber security is the profession that

196
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,259
they could be looking at and not just

197
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,020
going into the kind of standard path of

198
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,120
going to law or going to accounting but

199
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,639
also considering and also considering

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,620
different paths that can lead to cyber

201
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,139
security okay for instance we did the

202
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,120
status part of women and cyber

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
initiatives and we have people from very

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,880
different educational backgrounds we

205
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,520
have lower enforcement we have business

206
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,039
we have even anthropologists as part of

207
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,620
our women in the Cyber board and all

208
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,940
those options are valid okay

209
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,880
as you drink so I I just wanted to touch

210
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
on a couple of things that I've observed

211
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,740
in in my career and and I am a career

212
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,479
changer I did not do cyber security

213
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,460
before so I came into this kind of

214
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,539
totally

215
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,419
from another field altogether nothing to

216
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,580
do with tech so I've had the opportunity

217
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,680
to kind of really look at this from the

218
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,800
outside in as well as be now inside it

219
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,679
and one of the main issues that I see

220
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,820
with

221
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,640
um hiring for really lots of different

222
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,279
companies is the job postings that we

223
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,020
put out there

224
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,839
um it's been studied over and over again

225
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,279
that women are much less likely to apply

226
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,220
for a job if there's this long list of

227
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,100
qualifications that are required and

228
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,140
they don't meet all of them and I think

229
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,120
we all know most job postings like it's

230
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,220
a wish list right you hope you might

231
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,140
find that purple squirrel that has all

232
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,120
those things but they really probably

233
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,100
don't actually exist but that's a big

234
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,140
deterrent for women they they will just

235
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,260
pass that job right by so um I have

236
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,180
observed a trend which companies

237
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,279
changing how they write their their job

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,420
postings

239
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,640
um and that's a really good thing but

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,200
that would be the first thing I would

241
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
tell companies to look at is what are

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,740
your job postings look like that

243
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,019
absolutely works we

244
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,180
um we came across that side and we did

245
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,980
the experiment two years ago when we

246
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,320
start we adjusted our job ads

247
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,940
specifically for cyber Professionals in

248
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,700
the Caribbean region to have

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,019
um

250
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,839
to revert that in the way that there is

251
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,220
mandatory requirements to the less and

252
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,800
then there are something that is good

253
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
but the way it's rewarded you can apply

254
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
it as an extra and we have seen a huge

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
uptake in the obligations from women

256
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,500
really good professionals out of it

257
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,600
I like that so now that we've attracted

258
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,399
these people how can companies and

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,660
organizations

260
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,240
um and from the individual as well how

261
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
can we create a culture that supports

262
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
this diversity and inclusion and make

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
everyone that's in the organization feel

264
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,980
a part of the conversation

265
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
so I have a quick word on that one and

266
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,500
it kind of goes back to the job posting

267
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
thing but so a lot of companies like in

268
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,320
the tech cyberspace will advertise or

269
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,779
talk about their um culture as being

270
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,560
like foosball and Nerf guns and all that

271
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,080
kind of stuff when I read something like

272
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
that or I hear that's what a company's

273
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,440
like or they say you know on their

274
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
career page oh we have all these things

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm like I do not want to work there

276
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,740
because it's not that's not my thing I'm

277
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,480
sorry I really don't like Nerf guns all

278
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,700
that much I'm likely to be hit by the

279
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,060
things and uh but yeah so the culture is

280
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,579
a huge thing and I get a little tripped

281
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,100
up when people talk about you know we

282
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,680
want to hire somebody that matches the

283
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,660
culture of our you know our group or

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,820
whatever but if your group is all like

285
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,300
the same basic people right then your

286
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,160
culture is very specific to them then

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,980
you're you're not going to be letting in

288
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,440
you know these diverse groups that you

289
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
want so

290
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,060
I mean my take on it is that it all

291
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,279
starts with education for instance when

292
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,620
people saw around terms like diversity

293
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,800
inclusion unconscious bias we've all got

294
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,480
our own ideas about what those words

295
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,279
actually mean but we need to be on the

296
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,140
same page with what they actually mean

297
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,519
and what's the breadth of it and what's

298
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,540
the scope

299
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,180
and you know like I say with all

300
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,740
cultural changes it starts with

301
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,440
education then awareness then you know

302
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,540
promoting it Champion it leading by

303
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,519
example as an organization and showing

304
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,440
that you know as I said it's part and

305
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,660
parcel of how we operate and how we get

306
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,700
the best out of people once we attract

307
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,500
them which is a difficult thing in cyber

308
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,120
security but then how do we keep them

309
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,339
and how do we continue to evolve our

310
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,019
culture so that it stays fresh and Alive

311
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,180
because some cultures are there and

312
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,040
values that an organization have but

313
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,920
over time it needs to change

314
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,740
one word in your question is that I

315
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,860
wanted her life as equity and Equity

316
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,980
versus equality I was right here in this

317
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,500
room exactly two weeks ago when um

318
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
honorable Andrew Banks was given his

319
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,100
speech in support of the international

320
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,140
women's day international women's months

321
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,820
and the discussion was around the

322
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,560
difference between those two concepts

323
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,920
and when it comes to diversity it's very

324
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,740
important to understand that although we

325
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,500
can create opportunities that would be

326
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,399
equal for uh different

327
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,860
um groups and different people that may

328
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,380
not be enough what we we need to do is

329
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,920
to support Equity by propane those that

330
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,899
had different start because sometimes we

331
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,000
just we have different starting point so

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,519
to get to the same place we need more

333
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,320
help

334
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,060
how does that look from smaller

335
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,440
businesses

336
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,920
uh it's a lot of self-advocacy right I

337
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,380
I've done a lot of startups I think the

338
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,959
largest company I worked for was Netflix

339
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,260
and uh that was a miserable experience

340
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,360
um I I really like the sub 300 person

341
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,120
companies but at that point uh like the

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,680
first startup I ever worked for I found

343
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,420
out that I was not making anywhere near

344
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,240
what I should have been and I had to go

345
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,660
to a VP and say look I'm gonna file an

346
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,180
uh equal opportunity uh the EEOC

347
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,940
complaint if this is not addressed and

348
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,339
in the U.S the EEOC default employment

349
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,200
opportunity commission

350
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,579
um they don't just let you fill in a

351
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,380
form and file a complaint you have to go

352
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,779
through a two or three interviews and

353
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:40,980
then they give you the form to cover

354
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,660
okay we think you have a viable

355
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,360
complaint they triage very hard

356
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,200
um so I knew the risk there was that I'm

357
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,459
not going to get what I want and I'm

358
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,440
going to be out of a job and you have to

359
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,940
as an individual be comfortable with

360
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,820
that as it turned out HR flew out from

361
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,399
from California to to North Carolina and

362
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,959
investigated and then by the end of the

363
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,560
week I had a 30 raise so you have to be

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,540
willing to to suffer the consequences

365
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,420
you know that could have gone and it did

366
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,760
go very badly because my manager was not

367
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
really happy about that and basically

368
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,660
made my life a living hell after that

369
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,440
right so there's a certain amount of I

370
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,540
have to advocate for myself but I have

371
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,639
to protect myself at the same time and

372
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,160
you have to decide which where you're

373
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,860
going to fall on that Spectrum

374
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,160
nice so I work for a company

375
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,959
um and one of the things that we do is

376
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,700
we do employee network groups so we have

377
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,440
employee network groups for women for

378
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
vets for

379
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,779
um people that are neurodiverse for

380
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,699
um the Asian culture the black culture

381
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,820
lgbtq and so that gives those groups of

382
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,620
folks a space I also work for a company

383
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,180
that's got like 80 000 people in it too

384
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,279
across the world so

385
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,779
um that's something else that can be

386
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,579
done even on a smaller scale as your

387
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,260
company starts to grow and build and

388
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,339
things like that you can start to think

389
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,660
about

390
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,699
um creating these spaces for them to

391
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,260
come in and have conversation do

392
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,019
activities do events get the education

393
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,300
that they need you know what I'm saying

394
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,120
um so that's a good point thank you

395
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,519
um Pam

396
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,560
in your role what challenges have you

397
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,680
faced if any when hiring

398
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,459
um

399
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,380
building the diverse Workforce from the

400
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,820
government perspective and how have you

401
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,579
guys addressed that okay so working for

402
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,079
government it's been absolutely

403
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,300
fantastic actually I think that uh

404
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,519
certainly as a hiring manager you'll

405
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,079
you're empowered

406
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,800
uh and you're able to yourself you know

407
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,680
take the lead on ensuring that you know

408
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
you can hire the right people with the

409
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
right skills and it's not always down to

410
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,720
them having a formal education you have

411
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,459
to be prepared to find the right

412
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,160
candidate somebody that you can retrain

413
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,079
and you have to provide those retraining

414
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,420
opportunities and and I've done a lot of

415
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,300
uh work around internships for around

416
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,160
cyber security and it's been a it's been

417
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,459
wonderful I've taken on a mix of females

418
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,820
and males and 50 50 on on that front and

419
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,100
uh people with who weren't actually

420
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,839
interested in cyber security more

421
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,060
interested in an internship but you know

422
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,980
treating everybody as an individual and

423
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,420
providing them with the opportunities

424
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,760
has led to Great outcomes and you know

425
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,320
when we talk about work experience we

426
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,699
always talk about it in terms of

427
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,240
internships and 16 to early 20s we need

428
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,100
to provide our work experience

429
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,420
opportunities for all the people who

430
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,600
want to transition into a career we need

431
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,920
to work much more closely with

432
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Grassroots organization or doing great

433
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,699
things like here in the Cayman Islands

434
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,800
scifek are doing great things they're a

435
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
code academies

436
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
um also entry-level roles and uh

437
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,860
alternative ways of assessing people

438
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,500
it's not always down to having formal

439
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,019
education and and and uh you know the

440
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,000
academic qualification because when

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
truth be told we're all on a journey of

442
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,139
continuous learning and we can acquire

443
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,180
what we need to acquire for that job

444
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,880
while we're in the job working but like

445
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,740
I said I mean it's been fantastic

446
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,000
working for the Cayman Islands

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,559
government I feel very empowered to do

448
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,839
the things that I've done and there are

449
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,900
no barriers so

450
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,660
awesome so that comes from the the newer

451
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,540
folks but how do we address the issues

452
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,040
for career changers for folks that are

453
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,900
you know mid-career looking to change

454
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,699
transition

455
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,859
um what are your thoughts Marcel Carlota

456
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,880
oh I was an intern I did my transition

457
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,559
probably the ultimate all this turn ever

458
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,860
but

459
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,660
um but yeah being open to you know

460
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,600
looking at people candidates like that

461
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,820
um you know someone who looks like me

462
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,340
and is a little older I'm not going to

463
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,500
say how old some people might know

464
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,320
um but yeah just be open to exploring

465
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,900
these possibilities of bringing in folks

466
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,539
that aren't traditional you know in your

467
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,620
mind

468
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,240
um you know another thing that I see a

469
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,480
lot of in the states is requirements for

470
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,299
like like a four-year degree

471
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,520
um I'm I will tell you that there's many

472
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
many jobs in cyber security that do not

473
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,720
require a four-year degree or they

474
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,120
shouldn't require a four-year degree

475
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,900
um and not that I I we're both College

476
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,260
professors I'm not knocking that but um

477
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,080
but yeah just you know being open

478
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,640
having people come in from different

479
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,100
backgrounds and and that sort of thing

480
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
and and for my part I made a conscious

481
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,020
decision I had a very unusual kind of

482
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,179
path into cyber security myself on one

483
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,100
hand I'm a College Dropout and on the

484
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,419
other hand I have a master's degree from

485
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,220
Columbia I did go back to school so I'm

486
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,620
very I grew up very poor you know some

487
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,340
very uh attuned to to Opportunities and

488
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,720
that the fact that I had to make a lot

489
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,940
of opportunities for myself so I was an

490
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,039
eye to Enterprise I.T for many years I

491
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,360
ended up at a little startup called

492
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,059
FireEye in 2013 and they were about 300

493
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,760
people because I love that space and by

494
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
the end of the year they were 1100

495
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,700
people and then they bought mandiant and

496
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,679
they were 2 000 plus people I mean it

497
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,299
was it was within the span of a year you

498
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,179
went from 300 person org to a 2000 plus

499
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,240
I think almost 2 500 person work and I

500
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,980
was able to kind of create little

501
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,620
opportunities for myself within that I

502
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,539
was the platform admin for the for the

503
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,220
communities I was a technical platform

504
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,780
admin for the communities and content

505
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,299
management systems and the person they

506
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,700
hired to run the communities was neither

507
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
technical nor interested in security and

508
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,240
he was failing fundamentally our

509
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,360
communities and I started answering

510
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,740
questions in the communities and I took

511
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,660
them over that's how I got into security

512
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,299
right and I got very addicted to helping

513
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,160
you know lots I helped hundreds of

514
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,900
security teams across the globe solve

515
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,240
problems and I got addicted to that but

516
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,039
there's there was no other opportunity

517
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,360
there were no other like Community

518
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,600
manager roles at the time in cyber

519
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,120
security vendors I could grow into or

520
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
move into to further my career so I had

521
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,620
to make my own opportunities and I think

522
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,440
that you have to wherever you are it's

523
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
always going to be easier if you're

524
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,160
working for a hospital for example see

525
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,720
if somebody in the security team will

526
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,820
Mentor you right try to use the

527
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,960
connections you have to create

528
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
opportunities for yourself and also for

529
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
them especially in the Cayman Islands we

530
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,940
have two major industries tourism and

531
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,539
financial services and sometimes what we

532
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,220
what I see is a limiting factor for

533
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,799
professionals is lack of knowledge and

534
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
medical industry so for instance someone

535
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,660
can be intimidated to go and work in

536
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,419
Security Financial Services because they

537
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,980
may understand their technical side but

538
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,419
may not understand the industry

539
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,240
specifics so um I could share a

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,100
mid-career for 100 women finance and

541
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,179
that's one of the areas that we're

542
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,940
looking at it's uh helping

543
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,740
um in our case women to transition

544
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,320
between different Industries to catch

545
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,419
them to close that Gap so that they can

546
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,919
work in the same area but in different

547
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
industry nice

548
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
yeah I was just thinking about

549
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
um my last job was for you know as

550
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,059
security services provider and we put on

551
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,400
an annual like threat Intel Summit for

552
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,260
customers and really anybody who wants

553
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,220
to come

554
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,419
um it's secure works I definitely

555
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,340
recommend checking out that threat Intel

556
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
Summit that they do it's very good okay

557
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,539
um even though I'm not there anymore but

558
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,940
uh but we always had like a cyber

559
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,460
competition for the participants and I

560
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,039
had the idea I'm like let's open up this

561
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,799
cyber competition run it internally for

562
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,320
the entire organization and it was such

563
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,940
an amazing thing because you know we had

564
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,240
people from finance and HR and and sales

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
all these different teams who really

566
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,059
didn't know much at all about the

567
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,740
technical aspects of cyber security

568
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,460
right and so people just love doing the

569
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,020
Cyber competition we would do like

570
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,179
weekly walkthroughs of like how to solve

571
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,980
things a lot of people got in trouble

572
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,380
with it for like downloading stuff on

573
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,000
their computers didn't think about that

574
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,240
one but but it was just a great way to

575
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,419
expose the broader audience of a company

576
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,120
to you know what we actually do in in

577
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,260
cyber security so highly recommend that

578
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,659
I like that idea so that plays into what

579
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,059
managers and leaders can do so what what

580
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,799
are some things that the folks that are

581
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,840
in those types of positions and those

582
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,640
leadership roles what can they do to

583
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,559
make sure that

584
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,059
um they're they're trying to maintain

585
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,860
this diverse group and they're not

586
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,900
looking into their own unconscious bias

587
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,419
to not hire or not bring folks in what

588
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,580
can they do to help maintain that we can

589
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,200
start down here at this then

590
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,120
I think one of the underrepresented

591
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,760
groups I think are and and when when

592
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,340
when when the truth be told you know our

593
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,380
Workforce needs to represent

594
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,559
the cultural society that we're in the

595
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,360
communities that we're in and and nobody

596
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,419
should be left behind I think

597
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,440
neurodiverse groups are left behind

598
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,720
currently and it's actually that is the

599
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
skill set that fits very well with cyber

600
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,679
security it's people that think

601
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,919
differently and who probably think like

602
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,500
the uh cyber adversaries so that's a

603
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,419
group I think is underrepresentative and

604
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,820
and more can be done there whether we

605
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,380
need to go as far as you know

606
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,720
affirmative action to neurodiverse

607
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,280
groups I'm not sure we need to go that

608
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,860
far but I think our managers can take

609
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,480
the lead and I certainly will be taking

610
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
the lead and providing opportunities for

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
people with with special needs

612
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,020
so thank you and I'm going to jump back

613
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,580
in here because I have a quote from

614
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,460
Linton Wells Linton Wells III was the

615
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,100
former CIO of the dod in the U.S and

616
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,740
he's also what's he's he's a volunteer

617
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,260
at a hacker conference every summer and

618
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,320
has been for almost 30 years he's he's a

619
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
well-seasoned gentleman and I asked him

620
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,320
Lynn he's one of my mentors and I adore

621
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,600
him but I said Lynn what would drive a

622
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Navy guy a DOD guy to a hacker

623
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,620
conference

624
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,460
especially in the early 90s and he said

625
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,980
I understood that diversity of thought

626
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,520
is key to protecting our country and I

627
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,799
can't wait for that diversity to come to

628
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,159
me I have to go out and bring it to me I

629
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,600
want I have to make them want to work

630
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,120
with me and I think that from a

631
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,220
leadership perspective is a hundred

632
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,840
percent what leaders need to do I think

633
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,260
Pam you've exemplified that in many ways

634
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,260
yeah I think so um generalized what was

635
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,320
I was saying what you need to As Leaders

636
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,679
we can build a culture that will focus

637
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,740
on individual strength and you know the

638
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,080
gaps and recognize and appreciate those

639
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,600
individual strengths since

640
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,559
um earlier today Ira was talking about

641
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,940
the internet response and the qualities

642
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,620
and a lot of qualities required for

643
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
instance response are very different

644
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,360
from the qualities required for their uh

645
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,220
technical support and from the

646
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,740
monitoring there are different mentality

647
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,720
that are required to be there so the

648
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,880
different people will be differently

649
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,380
suited for different roles and

650
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
recognizing those differences and

651
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,380
celebrating them I think it's important

652
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,100
for the managers and um as part of our I

653
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,380
mean the type of program one of the

654
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,280
programs that we started doing

655
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,340
internally is uh heart centered

656
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,340
leadership so we teach those going into

657
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,880
cyber more empathy and also doing the

658
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,299
trainings to help the mentality

659
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,059
of our professionals to be focused and

660
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,400
to trade so that when we are in a

661
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,100
stressful situation we can deal with

662
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,840
that situation properly with internal

663
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,159
staff with Communications we talked

664
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,240
about the importance of communication

665
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,000
yesterday uh from a legal perspective

666
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
another perspective but to just with any

667
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,380
incident response you need to have the

668
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,919
proper mentality and uh sometimes as Pam

669
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,120
is saying different groups are

670
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
differently suited for that

671
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,840
you have any thoughts

672
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,559
okay so I got distracted all right so I

673
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,940
have one more question

674
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,520
um that you guys probably have prepared

675
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,900
for but

676
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,940
um once these folks are in an

677
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,919
organization how can we help them

678
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,039
advance in cyber security in either in

679
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,480
this company that they're going to first

680
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,580
or into other companies like what can we

681
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,159
do or what can

682
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,100
organizations companies nonprofits do

683
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,140
um to help with career advancement and

684
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,520
that's for me to know because I'm trying

685
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,880
to get to their level right here

686
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,980
all right I'm gonna jump in on this one

687
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,720
um when I started volunteering with

688
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,960
grcie grca

689
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,980
grcie.org we call it Gracie but there's

690
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,140
no a in the in the domain

691
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,260
um I deliberately said I am better at

692
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,380
this point mentoring mid-career women

693
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,159
trying or with people trying to step up

694
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,419
in their career and whether they're

695
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,740
transitioning in cyber security or

696
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,380
already here my time is best spent

697
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,620
developing leadership in the next gen

698
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,299
leaders right

699
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,500
um so I think there's partially

700
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,020
recognizing that in yourself I think

701
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,320
companies definitely need to uh

702
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,080
stop leaving it to individual managers

703
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,320
on how you spend uh on whether Education

704
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,320
and Training gets approved because that

705
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,179
has very much worked against I think

706
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,980
women in underrepresented groups in the

707
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,960
past is that the manager who has to

708
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,460
approve that says well I don't think you

709
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,419
need it

710
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,059
uh so they don't approve it right so I

711
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,559
think companies need to be more

712
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,740
aggressive in letting the individuals

713
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,120
choose their mentors and choose their

714
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,980
education and being willing to fund that

715
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,500
and I think that we as has seasoned

716
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,320
professionals also need to be we need to

717
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,400
help the entry level and the

718
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,900
transitioners but we also need to really

719
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,299
be developing the leaders as well

720
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,640
and I would say creating Role Models as

721
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,980
well yes and that goes for the

722
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,659
mid-career Professionals for young

723
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,000
professionals and to

724
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,700
um scholarship students and even for the

725
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
younger folks in the universities

726
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,000
because sometimes see that

727
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
underpresented groups don't go in a

728
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,020
certain profession because they don't

729
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,460
see people like them in those

730
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,380
permissions they don't see those Role

731
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,700
Models so they don't think those

732
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,980
opportunities are there for them and

733
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,620
highlighting that they are is very

734
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,140
important yeah I was going to add to

735
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,360
like there was actually a campaign that

736
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,460
was run over Twitter from a security

737
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,320
company a couple years ago and it was

738
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,000
called This is what a hacker looks like

739
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
and people were encouraged to take

740
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
pictures of themselves doing uh sort of

741
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,620
not what you would expect the

742
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,779
stereotypical hacker to be doing right

743
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,539
and just being a woman if fits that

744
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,600
category right but um but yeah so I mean

745
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,260
if you Google female hacker like you're

746
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,360
just not gonna get a lot of good yeah

747
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,039
from there

748
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,620
exactly exactly you're gonna get you

749
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,679
know a girl with a dragon tattoo and

750
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,320
yeah Angelina Jolie of course it's

751
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
essential right maybe Penelope from NCIS

752
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,380
but there's just not a lot you know for

753
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,320
for a young woman to look for and and

754
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,299
you can take out the word woman and

755
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,940
insert you know any other diverse kind

756
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,679
of category

757
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,620
um so what Alexandra is saying is just

758
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,500
so important to have those role models

759
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,940
and those mentors and just somebody

760
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,640
who's actually doing you know the thing

761
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,159
that these people might want to do and

762
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,779
and to be honest that's why I do a ton

763
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,580
of public speaking

764
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,740
um it's not because I always wanted to

765
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,600
be a public speaker it's quite the

766
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,220
opposite but

767
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,020
um but I just think it's really

768
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,620
important to be that role model and get

769
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,240
in front of people and be a technical

770
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,419
woman and and so that's what I do but

771
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,220
um but um

772
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,740
from do you guys have anything in the

773
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,260
government here for helping with that

774
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,360
career advancement yeah

775
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,179
my mark can I speak for my team in my

776
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,980
department but my view of career

777
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,480
enhancement everybody always thinks it's

778
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,120
moving up to the next level

779
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,740
um but if you look at the way that

780
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,779
organizations are structured everybody

781
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,700
can't be a manager that's just the

782
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,220
reality of the situation but we can all

783
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,260
be leaders we all already are leaders I

784
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,600
tell my people you're a leader you can

785
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,820
do this and I get them to go outside of

786
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,760
their comfort zone and I plant that seed

787
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,020
in them that they're a leader because

788
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,179
I'm hoping I plant that seed and it will

789
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,100
grow into a tree and and one day they

790
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,200
will be a leader and I'm I'm sure of it

791
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
because sometimes it only takes a few

792
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,360
words and believing in people so I also

793
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,340
think career advancement is about

794
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,500
learning about other areas of the

795
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,020
organization you shouldn't spend all of

796
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,059
even if you want to be a cyber security

797
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,940
to see so don't spend all of your career

798
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,279
in that area go and find out about law

799
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,380
go and find out about project management

800
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,440
go and find out about marketing round

801
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,659
yourself off so that when you do become

802
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,000
a a manager or a director or an

803
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,860
executive you have got all of those

804
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,419
skills and you've built them as you're

805
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,179
going along in your career but the key

806
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,559
point I want to make is that we're all

807
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,020
leaders we can all be champions for

808
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,760
change it doesn't matter where we are in

809
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,419
an organization

810
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,120
I like that

811
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,740
um some other ways too I think is with

812
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,059
volunteering

813
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,399
um we're heavy volunteers I've been

814
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,779
volunteering with cyber Jitsu because

815
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,000
it's a volunteer role for 10 years at

816
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,380
this point

817
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,000
um and it gives you a lot of different

818
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,100
skills that Pamela was talking about

819
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,559
marketing uh business all of these

820
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,140
things public speaking so for those of

821
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,240
you that are interested in advancing and

822
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,980
enhancing your career volunteer work is

823
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,419
a good way to do that as well it also

824
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,520
builds a network and if you're if you're

825
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,440
coming from another industry then cyber

826
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,960
security volunteering at with with an

827
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,480
organization like cyberjutsu or Gracie

828
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,539
you know those are fantastic showing up

829
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,279
to your local conferences in your local

830
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,399
meetups it builds your network right

831
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,279
yeah network is huge in this industry as

832
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,559
I'm sure you all are aware but um like I

833
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,360
I can't even remember the last time like

834
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,720
I actually like applied for a job it was

835
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,980
because it's always just like hey myself

836
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,360
you want to come work for us I'm like

837
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,860
okay sure

838
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,820
but yeah the networking piece is big and

839
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,039
um I mean and my hat is off to the

840
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,620
gentleman who run b-sides Cayman Islands

841
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,080
because it's a heavy lift to put on a

842
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,299
conference like this for sure

843
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,100
um Mary and I know because we've put

844
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,659
together a conference we're planning a

845
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,640
conference now yes we are right we'll

846
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,299
take volunteers by the way also sponsors

847
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,299
um but uh but yeah so it is a great way

848
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,120
to to hone your skills and meet sort of

849
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,039
like-minded people

850
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,080
um and there's many groups out there it

851
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,440
doesn't have to be cyber Jitsu or Gracie

852
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
um to find something that works for your

853
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,179
your personal needs and and your

854
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,980
organization too I think it's great for

855
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,200
organizations to support these kind of

856
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,899
groups too and one quick more thought on

857
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:43,860
that

858
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,140
um for the diverse hiring thing

859
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,240
um like for example cyber Jitsu has a

860
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,659
job board so you can promote your job

861
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,279
openings there and you're going to get

862
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,760
an audience of you know of extreme

863
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,440
diverse so

864
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
um and these are things that people

865
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,840
don't even know about or think about

866
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,580
sometimes right well and I think coming

867
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,340
back to what can companies do sponsoring

868
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,020
these kinds of organizations and these

869
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,539
kinds of conferences you may not see the

870
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,480
money out of it you know immediately but

871
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,140
you do get a more favorable reputation I

872
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,260
think and you do get that exposure of

873
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,299
okay uh I've I've sponsored cyberjutsu

874
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,460
now diversity candidates are going to

875
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,200
look at me more favorably when they do

876
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,659
apply right or when they're considering

877
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,179
applying another related area is

878
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,539
mentorship yes being a mentor is first

879
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,880
you can help create that next generation

880
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,519
of the Cyber professionals that help

881
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,080
with Recruitment and ultimately with

882
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,480
overall security for for everyone and

883
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,000
it's uh Mandarin is very rewarding for

884
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,240
both minty and Mentor yes you build that

885
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,200
relationship and you build that

886
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,600
accountability right

887
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,880
um so final thoughts I'd like to know

888
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,679
what's that what's the top of mind for

889
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,140
all of you today as it relates to

890
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,960
security an inclusive Workforce and

891
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,059
partnering with organizations we'll

892
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,740
start in the middle and then go out to

893
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,520
the outside so you can start first

894
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,940
to me uh one focus is equity okay so

895
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,679
we're focusing on that and making sure

896
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,659
that we have that prop for

897
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,300
underrepresented

898
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,199
Professionals in the community and

899
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,199
another is looking broader at diversity

900
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,040
so not uh just gender race nationality

901
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,500
but

902
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,940
neurodiversity and temperament for

903
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,399
instance making sure that someone who is

904
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,560
an introvert has equal opportunities it

905
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,480
can can build a successful career okay

906
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,119
more so yeah and I think the thing that

907
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,918
this kind of top of mind for me is is

908
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,260
that it's not enough for an organization

909
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,639
to have like

910
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,980
like oh I've hired a woman on this team

911
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,619
my job here is done right

912
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:53,879
um because then it really puts all the

913
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,699
pressure on that person to represent you

914
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,099
know an entire gender or race or

915
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,140
whatever right

916
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,760
um so

917
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,619
just like don't stop at that first one

918
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,480
and I see that all the time

919
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
um the other thing that I also observe

920
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,320
is you know the company where I work is

921
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,020
like 15 000 employees and our diversity

922
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,020
inclusion Equity game is very strong but

923
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,320
when I look around just infosec the team

924
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,760
like it's not represented there so so I

925
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,260
think it's you know it's on the

926
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,000
leadership of these groups to make sure

927
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,740
that those initiatives are carrying

928
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,040
through into their departments as well

929
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,859
um because it doesn't just naturally

930
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,780
flow sometimes

931
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,740
okay

932
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,480
yeah and my final thought is that you

933
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,160
know we work together

934
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,740
open private sector to build a pipeline

935
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,640
of cyber talent to uh defend our nation

936
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,040
from now and into the future because the

937
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
demand is there and you know the extent

938
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,839
to which I can play a role in that I

939
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,640
certainly will and I and I'll be the

940
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,839
leader in that

941
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,859
awesome and Carlota everything it's all

942
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,560
on my mind Equity advocacy burnout and

943
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,480
Community I think in that order because

944
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,000
I I left my last job and I loved my last

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,320
job

946
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,900
um but I was handling eight clients I

947
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,060
was decisive for eight small companies I

948
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,220
was handling sales I was coaching the

949
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,440
senior analyst I was coaching the the

950
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,599
junior analyst and I and and then my

951
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,880
boss expected me to build out my own

952
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,300
Proposal with no equity right and I was

953
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,160
just like okay no I'm not doing that and

954
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,980
and I quit and I started pocket see so

955
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,240
to build out my own thing and then I

956
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,060
realized I am too burnt out to move

957
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,400
so I literally Incorporated my my

958
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,079
company in November and then just

959
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,460
couldn't do anything for three months

960
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,140
because I was well hey it's the holidays

961
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,820
nobody's doing anything anyway so it's

962
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,980
kind of the perfect time

963
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,579
um but it was also you know I maybe I'm

964
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,920
maybe in maybe I just need some time off

965
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,540
so I took my time off and I came back

966
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,060
and I was still feeling very burnt out

967
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,980
uh and I leaned on my community like the

968
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,579
because I'm a one-woman show I really

969
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,099
needed in my community to to cheer me on

970
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,079
and I really appreciate everyone who's

971
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,940
gone like that's a great idea you need

972
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,859
to stay focused on that I know you're

973
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,140
burnt out take a little more time right

974
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,400
so uh those those things Equity advocacy

975
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,680
burnout in community like you're going

976
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
to face all of those challenges in your

977
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,680
career whether you're in cyber security

978
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,260
or not nice so we could talk about this

979
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,680

980
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,740

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,480
good morning and I am really pleased to

995
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,680
see

996
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,680
um this interjection into this um all

997
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,839
seminars this week in terms of the

998
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,480
diversity that up there and women that

999
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,660
are up there this is truly pleasing

1000
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,300
and I'm totally in line I've taken

1001
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,540
education and I'm more so pointing my

1002
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,619
question to I mean spam green

1003
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:36,060
the diversity in Tech 2021 states that

1004
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,880
in the U.S 68 percent of businesses

1005
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,780
Business Leaders believe there is a lack

1006
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,200
of diversity in the I.T world and that

1007
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,880
is a problem

1008
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,280
my question and I'm totally with you in

1009
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,579
terms of Education in the field I was

1010
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,859
exposed recently in the last two weeks

1011
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,800
to an awesome program that is being done

1012
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,060
has been embarked just this year at the

1013
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,099
ucci University of the Cayman Islands

1014
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:10,079
where I was pleased at the I.T table

1015
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,420
because I've been in the I.T field for

1016
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,280
over 25 years

1017
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,060
and there it was only one female among

1018
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,440
the group of over 10 gentlemen so my

1019
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,960
question is really how deliberate are we

1020
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,560
in terms of um moving towards the

1021
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,260
diversity for females in the industry

1022
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,200
and with the government being one of the

1023
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,160
largest leaders employment agencies yeah

1024
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,180
how are we gearing towards that

1025
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,740
so

1026
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,280
um are we being deliberate are we

1027
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,900
incorporating programs that are out

1028
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,440
there to try and promote to bring in um

1029
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,720
female and I'm I'm loving what was

1030
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,359
shared earlier that we must do promotion

1031
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,119
we must have more of this forum so our

1032
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,240
females can see what the leaders are

1033
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,300
currently doing and where they too can

1034
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,359
look to Aspire because again with the

1035
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,359
hospitality the reverse was there the

1036
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,660
hospitality table one meal and all

1037
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,420
female we need to change that complex

1038
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,400
thank you for that question um I

1039
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,780
completely agree with you I think

1040
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,079
statistics from the U.S is not the same

1041
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,560
as what's going on here so if it's 60 of

1042
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,480
leaders in the US

1043
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,280
feel uh there's not enough diversity I

1044
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,140
don't think that's the same here but you

1045
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,180
did Hit Upon a good point is that we

1046
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,280
need to know as a baseline what is that

1047
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,780
statistic here

1048
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,619
so when I looked into that back in 2021

1049
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,660
actually you know we are ahead of the Us

1050
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,079
and other jurisdictions in terms of for

1051
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,579
instance the number of women that work

1052
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:56,480
yeah and also

1053
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,859
behind slightly but the number of women

1054
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,579
in technology so it's about making sure

1055
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,320
that those women

1056
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,480
you know be counted they stand up they

1057
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,880
show the the young ladies and the young

1058
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,700
guys that you know technology certainly

1059
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,220
cyber security is very diverse here in

1060
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,839
the Cayman there are opportunities for

1061
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,380
you but seeing is believing as you said

1062
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,839
so I mean it's difficult to know any one

1063
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,700
time all of the different panels and

1064
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,619
discussions that are going on but

1065
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,839
anytime I'm invited to speak to young

1066
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,760
people I take that opportunity because

1067
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,619
for me young people are the future

1068
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,859
they're the leaders of tomorrow and uh

1069
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,079
we must invest time in it and I do that

1070
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,839
on a personal level I think yeah I think

1071
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,700
there's also a perception issue right

1072
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,859
because especially women in

1073
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,359
underrepresented groups we become very

1074
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,980
good communicators to get into these

1075
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,480
roles and once you're a good

1076
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,579
communicator you're no longer considered

1077
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,020
technical even if you are deeply

1078
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,839
technical a lot of times as as a woman

1079
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,579
especially you're going to be pushed

1080
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:57,780
more into Marketing in an Enterprise

1081
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,300
organization fire three years trying to

1082
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,780
move me into marketing and um I refused

1083
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,700
because that's not the path I wanted to

1084
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,579
take and I think that that especially in

1085
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,320
Silicon Valley and I imagine to a lesser

1086
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,520
degree here but there's going to always

1087
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,740
be an undercurrent of oh you're not a

1088
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,260
developer so you're not deeply technical

1089
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,079
and that's just not true you know your

1090
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,000
developer is technical in a different

1091
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
way from your systems administrator

1092
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,960
right your your network admin who writes

1093
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,180
batch scripts for things is technical in

1094
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,160
a different way from your front-end

1095
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,099
developer right it and and conversely

1096
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,200
similarly I should say

1097
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,180
um anyone who's communicating those

1098
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,520
technical Concepts and organizing that

1099
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,700
and running that program like your csos

1100
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,859
we're still technical you know we still

1101
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,660
have those technical chops but because

1102
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,480
we're now program managers or leaders

1103
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,640
we're not the technical ones anymore and

1104
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,960
we're not the ones that they're inviting

1105
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,420
to necessarily to the table

1106
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,020
cool another question good morning

1107
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,480
um I'm so pleased to be here um

1108
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,960
listening to your extraordinary women as

1109
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,000
a member of gender equality came on you

1110
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,200
know

1111
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,099
um we promote diversity in the workplace

1112
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,740
um but I believe it comes down to what

1113
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,660
Pam mentioned a few minutes ago about

1114
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,060
education educating people what is

1115
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,740
diversity

1116
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,180
um so I'm sitting here one might say you

1117
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,280
know what this isn't a diverse panel

1118
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,800
because there's no mail that's true I

1119
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,780
heard so that person is attributing

1120
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,420
diversity to gender yeah but from my

1121
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,700
opinion is very diverse I'm seeing

1122
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,079
different race persons from different

1123
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,300
background and so forth so my question

1124
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,260
is

1125
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,900
um what is more important to you

1126
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,839
high in a diverse Workforce or hiring

1127
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,420
the right person for the job

1128
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,280
they shouldn't be mutually exclusive

1129
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
yeah exactly exactly

1130
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,440
I want to hire the right person for the

1131
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,020
job but I also want to make sure that I

1132
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,260
have a diverse team and and like I said

1133
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,660
you can do both at the same time for

1134
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,040
sure it should be one in the same

1135
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,540
because cyber security there are

1136
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,520
different jobs and there will be a very

1137
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
different people required for each of

1138
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,859
those jobs if if you hire

1139
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,839
based on those jobs then you will end up

1140
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,720
with diversity by itself it just may be

1141
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,520
diversity in different aspects we're not

1142
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,480
saying don't hire men

1143
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,680
we're just saying look at everyone

1144
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,480
and pick the best person from that group

1145
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,579
whether that's a female somebody that's

1146
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,220
black or Asian or you know from the UK

1147
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,500
or whatever it is you can find the right

1148
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,180
person in that group as well right

1149
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,040
although I mean can you find the right

1150
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,420
person are you looking in the right

1151
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,400
places that's the other thing too right

1152
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,380
so if you're kind of have a narrower

1153
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,260
pull then that's going to have an impact

1154
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,680
on on what that looks like for you and I

1155
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,560
think it also I think it speaks to

1156
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,400
the pipeline issue right if if only I'm

1157
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,260
getting white males for candidates I'm

1158
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,480
going to end up one I I Can Only Hold

1159
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,160
the job open so long to look for a

1160
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,140
diversity candidate to see if they are

1161
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,480
as good or better right at some point

1162
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,880
business has to keep moving but if

1163
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,560
you're in that situation where you don't

1164
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,079
have that pipeline then you should as a

1165
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,640
leader in your community or a leader in

1166
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,500
your organization you should be going

1167
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,240
out and creating that Pipeline and maybe

1168
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,520
you won't get the benefit of it in the

1169
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,380
next five years maybe not in the next

1170
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,240
20. maybe you're going to elementary

1171
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,520
schools and you know trying to to create

1172
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,500
that pipeline there but you still need

1173
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,180
to be contributing to it if if you're

1174
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,300
not seeing a diverse candidate pool

1175
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,460
all right are there any final questions

1176
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,819
I see her all right

1177
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:40,440
technically our time's up and we take

1178
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,940
one more we've got two minutes with the

1179
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,520
red screen down here oh all right time's

1180
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,599
up for speaking I think we can still

1181
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,940
take the questions

1182
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,380
you were deprived of a few minutes so I

1183
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,980
think you're okay

1184
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,700
um I just wanted to say this may come

1185
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,740
into your support

1186
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,300
um bucket but what role do you see what

1187
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,060
should we say employment benefits in

1188
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,280
terms of promoting diversity and

1189
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,800
inclusivity

1190
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,720
um that's a good one

1191
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,599
um at least in the states I think one of

1192
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:15,839
the employment benefits is um

1193
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,380
having insurance coverage for like

1194
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,720
same-sex partners for example and I

1195
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,339
don't know how it works here I apologize

1196
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,680
but um but that's not a given

1197
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,960
necessarily in the states

1198
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,720
um supporting paying for the costs for

1199
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,180
like say gender reassignment surgery

1200
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,280
that's you know something that's going

1201
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,040
to draw granted maybe a narrow pool of

1202
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,140
candidates but it's going to make

1203
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,900
generally candidates um possibly feel

1204
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,000
better about your organization those are

1205
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,560
two that come to mind right away I don't

1206
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,660
know if you think education having the

1207
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,579
ability to either have your education

1208
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,579
reimbursed or paid for I worked at

1209
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,500
General Dynamics and they gave us our

1210
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,540
twelve thousand dollars a year to go to

1211
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,359
school every year very nice I mean that

1212
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,760
was definitely something that Drew me in

1213
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,380
yeah and I think for the the US the

1214
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,079
remote work is huge because so many

1215
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,599
underrepresented groups uh women

1216
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,099
diversity candidates whatever if we can

1217
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,260
work remotely and have a more flexible

1218
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,060
schedule we can support our family and

1219
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,099
our community better and I'm not having

1220
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,720
to leave I'm not having to choose

1221
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,339
between do I want to stay in your family

1222
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,380
and Community or do I want to take a job

1223
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,940
in Boston and that's a very specific

1224
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,660
example for a reason but you know

1225
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,700
yeah and and part of my disagreement

1226
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,560
with my former company and again love

1227
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,180
the company absolutely would recommend

1228
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,940
anyone go work for them but senior

1229
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,680
leaders were allowed to be remote but

1230
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,260
anyone who is not a virtual CSO had to

1231
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,260
be in that Boston area office and I

1232
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,359
think that's that's just that's the

1233
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,640
control issue right I get that you want

1234
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,700
to see butts and seeds there are leaders

1235
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,680
who honestly feel like you can't create

1236
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,800
a remote effective remote Workforce it

1237
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,960
takes a different focus it takes a

1238
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,060
different level of energy and I get it's

1239
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,119
not as spontaneous it's more intentional

1240
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,880
um so I think remote work is huge for

1241
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,220
underrepresented groups and and just

1242
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,420
huge

1243
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,420
and general flexibility yeah but one

1244
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,619
thing I want to say about facility it

1245
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,260
needs to be done right so for instance

1246
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,680
if we talk about overworking mothers

1247
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,819
flexible is a good thing because you can

1248
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,040
pick up your child something but it's

1249
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,520
also important not to create a

1250
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,920
stereotype of a bias because someone has

1251
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,359
children it doesn't mean that this

1252
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,280
person will be less available right or

1253
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,339
will have less time and therefore will

1254
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,800
be less

1255
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,619
is less promoted because right that they

1256
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,819
expect it to have more time yeah and uh

1257
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:48,839
especially in cyber I would say because

1258
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:50,339
we're dealing with incident response

1259
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,720
incidents don't work nine to five

1260
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,700
I think they prefer to not work nine to

1261
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,680
five

1262
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,380
and another related thing is the the

1263
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,079
maternity believe in their flexibility

1264
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,579
around that as well technically I'm

1265
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,579
going to maternity right now

1266
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:09,420
he's trying to be we're trying to

1267
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,000
believe too is the good thing

1268
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,300
off as well

1269
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,020
nothing further to add

1270
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,579
all right so um that's all the time we

1271
