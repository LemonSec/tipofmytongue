1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,259
hi there

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,060
um so anyway it's kind of interesting

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,160
they called me up about five minutes ago

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
and said are you speaking today and I

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,599
was like yeah I speak at 10 o'clock

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,420
they're like no uh you speak now there

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,340
was an adjustment to the schedule I go I

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,020
know I looked at the thing I'm looking

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,660
online and they're like

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,180
and this I don't get I blame them for

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,460
this but anyway what happened was my

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,680
computer literally still says 10 o'clock

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,019
because I don't when I get to a new time

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,540
zone I don't bother having I don't want

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,420
my computer to readjust the time zone

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,000
and so for some reason they have this

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,059
Dynamic time on the system depending on

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,460
your time zone and I don't know I just

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,260
think that's stupid since I didn't pay

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,020
any attention to that so anyway

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
um actually that's kind of relevant to

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,300
my presentation too so here's the thing

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,280
when they you know when I started saying

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,500
Hey I want to speak in the Cayman

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,239
Islands because this event sounds really

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,280
cool I'm like what type of talk can I

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,199
give for this and then I'm thinking

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,380
let's talk about scuba diving so if I go

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,439
scuba diving it'll all be tax deductible

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,560
and everything like a business expense

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
so it is and I had to do my research of

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,180
course while I was here so that's a

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,280
given so anyway with that in mind

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,479
because

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,619
um actually let me go through the

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,420
presentation because it starts covering

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,420
a lot so the first time I ever heard you

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,780
the phrase you can't stop stupid was

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,600
when I was taking my instructor class

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
and this guy uh what's John's last John

41
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,360
Kaiser this is the course director that

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,159
I took it from the guy like has

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,400
certified probably the most divers for

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,040
Patty in like history or something at

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
some point in time and he's local to me

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
and they're the local dive shop so I

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,159
just randomly wandered in there and I

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,920
started taking classes I liked it so I

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
kept taking another class because

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,420
there's no reason to dive in Maryland

51
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,159
honestly the diving pretty much anywhere

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
except the Caribbean anywhere near here

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
really sucks so anyway the only reason I

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,300
would take diving or I would be able to

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,819
go diving was to keep taking classes So

56
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,620
eventually I finally like worked my way

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,599
up like through the ranks and then it

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,580
was like do I actually want to be a

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,620
professional instructor I'm like I don't

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,720
really care but it's a good excuse to go

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,239
diving more so anyway I went ahead and I

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,980
did that it also makes diving tax

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,200
deductible because if I ever have to go

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,660
on a refresher dive it's to refresh my

65
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,480
skills as part of my professional

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,980
responsibility studies but anyway we

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,140
were sitting in the class and John's the

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,120
type who mumbles and he's the he was

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,620
mumbling it's like no matter what you do

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,200
you can't stop stupid some student you

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,760
tell them what to do no matter what

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,739
happens they're gonna do it you just

73
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,379
can't stop stupid and I'm like sitting

74
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,200
there thinking this whole course is

75
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,860
about stopping stupid it's about dive

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,920
standards it's about pretty much what

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,879
you do to plan for people being stupid

78
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,379
and there was a

79
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,140
sorry I remember once like so just a

80
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,480
heads up the title of my well second

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,760
most recent book is you can stop stupid

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
by the way and you know I also hear in

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,180
cyber security a world-renowned

84
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,220
ex-hacker uh and I kind of almost throw

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,019
up in my mouth as I say that I'm not

86
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,120
going to mention the name was quoted as

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,580
saying you can't patch stupid I'll just

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,260
give you a hint as a cyber security

89
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,680
professional patching stupid is your job

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,440
because you can't stop it from existing

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,620
but it's your job to stop the results

92
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,680
from people being stupid and frankly

93
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,780
behind every stupid user is a stupider

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,239
security professional in general so you

95
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,799
gotta start thinking that as well

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,080
because if you know the user is going to

97
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,659
do something stupid and you don't say

98
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,159
hey the user is going to do something

99
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,140
stupid let me do something about that in

100
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,900
advance that's on you but anyway the

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,599
first time I heard this was back in my

102
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,980
diving course

103
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,620
and I'm sitting there thinking again we

104
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,080
are taking hundreds of hours of training

105
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,360
to stop stupid

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,780
so let me tell you about my stupid and

107
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,299
anyway I've had probably four near-death

108
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,279
experiences maybe more I've lost count

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,160
that's how bad I am at this and you know

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
one of them involves scuba diving and I

111
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,479
have a sea lion on here because it's a

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
nice picture but also because it was

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,340
ironically during a sea lion dive and

114
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,259
the sea lion literally had nothing to do

115
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,120
with this but anyway it's a nice picture

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,820
so anyway what was happening was I was

117
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,520
on a dive where you like you you go out

118
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,340
and this was in Curacao you dive out and

119
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,620
then you sit someplace and then the

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,660
trainer brings over a sea lion and then

121
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,400
the sea lion goes among people and

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,380
everything like that so then we were

123
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,540
finishing up the dive and what happened

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,240
was this was in Curacao and the waves

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,540
really really suck and so what happened

126
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,660
was at this Resort where I was they had

127
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,639
this and I it's hard for me to describe

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,860
but you know they had like a wall of

129
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,780
rocks around the dolphin enclosure

130
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,520
because this was like an aquatic Park

131
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,680
type of thing where they had sea lions

132
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,199
they had Dolphins but then they had kind

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,900
of also built around it a little Cove so

134
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,419
when you went down you wanted to go

135
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,340
diving you got in the water in the cove

136
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,600
and then you don't and then you

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,880
underwater went around and so what

138
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,740
happened was we dove in the cove and

139
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,380
went around underwater and then

140
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,120
um as we were coming back from this

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,880
because I just remember as we get to

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
kind of where the wall is we see a light

143
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,139
because when you're underwater all of a

144
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,820
sudden you see like lights to the side

145
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,500
and that's kind of where I thought the

146
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,419
Cove was because you know there's not

147
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,000
like perfect visibility down there and

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,680
what happened was all of a sudden I saw

149
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,780
a light and I followed the light it

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,600
wasn't like Poltergeist Carrie in stay

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
away from the light but anyway there I

152
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,580
was I followed the light unlike Carrie

153
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,860
Anne and I went ahead followed the light

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,360
and then all of a sudden I realized I'm

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,120
at a wall and then I start like and then

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,639
all of a sudden a wave picks me up and

157
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,740
puts me on top of this Rocky ledge

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,080
because what happened was was for the

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,080
dolphin enclosure they had little holes

160
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,419
in the enclosed like in the like rocks

161
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,120
to allow water from overflowing going

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,520
back and forth and so on so anyway there

163
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,340
I was on this ledge and then I decided

164
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
okay this kind of sucks and I shouldn't

165
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,780
be here so I try to just go back into

166
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,759
the water well what happened was there

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
were just like series of small waves

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
which kind of kept me there and then big

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,840
waves would come and slam me into the

170
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,300
rocks and that really sucked I'll tell

171
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,819
you that much so there I was waiting for

172
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,919
like you know trying like a couple times

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,199
while the little waves were coming and

174
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,699
trying to get back but it was still

175
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,680
enough to keep me there and then the big

176
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
waves would come and I would have to

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,120
grab onto these Coral rocks and my

178
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,000
fingers were bleeding because Coral Rock

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,460
really sucks it's not like a nice rock

180
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,160
it's like Coral so then what happens

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
there I was on this and then the Dive

182
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,199
Master sees me and he's like come on it

183
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,759
you know come on back in and he's there

184
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,160
floating like 20 feet away I'm like just

185
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,199
shaking my head because when you're

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,240
diving the things you're trained to do

187
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,180
is to keep your regulator in your mouth

188
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,000
and your mask on no matter what if

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,759
you're in potential harm so I just kept

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
this and I just kept shaking my head no

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,979
and the guy thought I was panicking real

192
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,020
Panic means you tear off your mask and

193
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,460
don't have your regulator in your mouth

194
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,960
if you're a good instructor by the way

195
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,419
but anyway what happened was there I was

196
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,120
and then the Dive Master decided he's

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
going to get on the rocks with me to

198
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,080
help me off and then he realized why I

199
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,840
was still on the Rocks so there I was in

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,880
that case and then what happened was

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,039
remember there was a little hole into

202
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,380
this dolphin enclosure it used to have

203
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,539
like rebar but it all kind of rusted

204
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,419
away and before this I also took some

205
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,000
training because I also dive to help

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,979
maintain oyster reefs in the Chesapeake

207
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,819
Bay to try to keep that Cesspool clean

208
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,319
and what happened was

209
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,300
you know then it was like okay how do

210
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,520
you get yourself kind of small and I

211
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,620
took off my equipment and kept on it

212
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,940
pushed the equipment through and then

213
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,919
went through the hole and then I was in

214
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,139
the dolphin enclosure and now I'm gonna

215
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,120
curse here because Dolphins can be real

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,060
 that's a given everybody thinks

217
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,340
dolphins are sweet smart things they can

218
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,099
be territorial bastards so there I was

219
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,240
thinking I mean they're going to get

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,000
killed by the rocks or potentially you

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,219
know have like be a play toy for

222
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,260
dolphins because one of my friends I'll

223
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,299
talk about them later is a you know Navy

224
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,640
SEAL and I'm like what was it you know I

225
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,899
talked did you ever work with like

226
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,000
dolphins or sea lions he's like oh yeah

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,700
he's like dolphins really suck because

228
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,860
dolphins are trained in the military to

229
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,800
do Force protection and go around ships

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
and if they see enemy divers to just you

231
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,980
know just keep poking at them and keep

232
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,420
poking at them he's like it could get

233
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,279
away from sea lions if you hug the

234
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,980
bottom but Dolphins at echolocation he's

235
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,600
like those little will keep

236
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,940
going for your heart it I'm like what do

237
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,860
you do he's like curl up in a ball and

238
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,200
hope they pull you out quickly so there

239
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
I was after everything else happened

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
expecting to curl up in a ball and

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,959
getting pulled out but luckily somebody

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,180
saw and pulled us up on Top of the Rock

243
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,040
so anyway that's my near-death

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,500
experience what did I do I did something

245
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,260
really stupid by ending up on the Rocks

246
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,600
but again it was a lot of things right

247
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,420
by not panicking by making sure I kept

248
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,459
my mask on by making sure because if I

249
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,100
ever put took the mask off even in my

250
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,899
hand it literally would have been float

251
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,899
you know pushed away really quickly but

252
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,000
again kept everything on and then

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,620
started using the training it's like

254
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,420
okay how do I get through that little

255
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,000
hole and started using my equipment to

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,040
get out of there and then having sense

257
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,140
enough to say let me stay near these

258
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,240
rocks so these I'm not swimming in the

259
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,920
middle of the dolphin pool and stuff

260
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,959
where the Dolphins can like use me as a

261
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,660
play toy again but anyway that's kind of

262
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,420
my stupidity and I've done stupid things

263
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,940
more more than that yeah so now here's

264
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,920
the thing a lot goes wrong in scuba

265
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,740
diving but it can be pretty safe now one

266
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,660
thing is I mentioned I had you know I

267
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,000
ended up with um I ended up on the rocks

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,339
that was obviously a really dumb thing

269
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,740
and things that end up going wrong I was

270
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,080
once bit by a green sea turtle because I

271
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,240
was also a volunteer diver at the

272
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,160
National Aquarium in Baltimore

273
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,620
and what happened was we had this green

274
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,980
sea turtle in this tank and we were not

275
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,660
allowed to release it because one of the

276
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,760
flippers was kind of it got

277
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,500
um caught up in fishing line and they

278
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,880
had to remove the flipper so they

279
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,320
couldn't release it back out in the wild

280
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,720
and what would happen was we'd keep it

281
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,700
for all the tourists and everything and

282
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,100
we would have to hand feed this

283
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,620
sea turtle like we're supposed to feed a

284
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,320
cabbage and broccoli brussels sprouts

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,600
and things like that we're not supposed

286
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,220
to feed a shrimp because in the same

287
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,959
tanks they were stingrays much like it

288
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,779
happened Stingray City out there and so

289
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,959
you know we would feed this the Rays

290
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,019
um shrimp because Rays loves shrimp and

291
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,120
the Taurus loved to see these you know

292
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,399
stingrays give all the divers hickeys

293
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,140
and stuff like that crawling up and down

294
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
us so there we were the attraction

295
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,339
bigger than the Rays and what happened

296
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,740
though was some of the other divers

297
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,560
would still feed the turtle the shrimp

298
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,620
and there I was and I I would never feed

299
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,480
the turtle the shrimp but one time again

300
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,820
I was feeding the Rays other divers were

301
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,100
trying to take care of the turtle and

302
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,320
then I like bent over on my back because

303
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,880
you know water start filling the mask

304
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,940
just bent over to or turned over and I'm

305
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,920
holding like the shrimp like you know

306
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
this while I'm doing that and Clarion

307
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
and all of a sudden I just feel

308
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,640
something clamped down on my hand and

309
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,019
that was a nice little sea turtle

310
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,240
because all those other bastard divers

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,180
would feed the turtles shrimp so this

312
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,000
the turtle did not know hey if a diver

313
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
is not actually trying to feed you

314
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,540
shrimp don't use their hands as a feeder

315
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,640
so anyway then there was another time I

316
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,959
ran out of air

317
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,779
and literally I was like and I'm gonna

318
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,700
get to this later but all scuba

319
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,860
professionals are not the same quality

320
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,620
and one time I was on this early dive

321
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,720
one of my first Dives out after

322
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,959
instruction and I had and I couldn't get

323
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,540
down and then the Dive Master oh you you

324
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,279
know you got to stop panicking and go

325
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,019
I'm not panicking I'm like literally

326
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,300
trying to show I'm pulling myself down

327
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,160
the rope and I'm still being held up

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,260
because you know there was air in the

329
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,600
BCD no matter what I did and the diver

330
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,519
was a and then he's like uh you know

331
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,380
finally I managed to get down there by

332
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,320
putting lots of rocks in my pockets and

333
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,820
then what happens is I'm going around

334
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,700
and like after a little bit longer all

335
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,500
of a sudden I'm like sucking in and I

336
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,459
was like

337
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,100
I think I'm out of air and I'm like

338
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,779
sitting there it's like I can't be out

339
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,700
of air and then I look at my you know

340
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,220
look at the little air regular and it's

341
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,079
like I'm out of air and then I'm like

342
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,399
sitting there thinking do I have to do

343
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
one of those stupid odds and go up

344
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,079
slowly like they train you and I'm like

345
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,600
yeah I have to do that so anyway I did

346
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,279
that got to the surface then the Dive

347
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,260
Master comes and I go I'm out of here

348
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,639
he's like you can't be out of air I'm

349
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,860
like show him he's like oh you're just

350
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,079
breathing too much I'm like it's not the

351
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,300
fact my equipment has more air than I do

352
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,060
you know anyway that's you know bad

353
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,680
equipment even when it's supposed to be

354
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
good leaking Mass you know you do have

355
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,300
mass that leak no matter what you use a

356
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,100
dive Hood sometimes it really screws

357
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,380
things up but these things happen over

358
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,300
time and then here's a good one the

359
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,160
reason I have a picture of Amore eel

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
here I was once on a dive trip at a Fort

361
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,079
Lauderdale and this one guy was diving

362
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,760
and he was trying to you know catch

363
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,880
lobsters and so what happened was we all

364
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,980
went our ways it wasn't a guy to dive

365
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,899
then we were just doing a drift dive

366
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,079
along the coast and then I get up

367
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,660
top and there's this guy all with his

368
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
hand benched up bandage up dripping

369
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,760
blood down his arm it was like and I'm

370
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,700
like what I was like oh I'm okay I like

371
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,440
I don't care if you're okay I'm just

372
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
curious what happened and then he's like

373
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,540
well I was like feeling under a reef and

374
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,700
then I you know to catch lobsters and

375
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,260
then apparently there was an eel under

376
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,160
there

377
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,560
and so what happened was the guy who was

378
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,600
an experienced diver you're supposed to

379
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,420
know to have a poll and to like use

380
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,700
poles to go under so you don't get bit

381
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,399
by eels and other bad things like

382
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,680
lionfish and stuff and for those of you

383
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
that don't know eels are like alien

384
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,180
because this is Amore yield that does

385
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,000
not look very scary with the teeth the

386
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,279
problem is it has a second set of Jaws

387
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,139
where the outer jaw when it bites

388
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,480
something just grabs it and the second

389
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,779
shot like alien juts out with lots of

390
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,300
big fangs grabs it and then pulls it

391
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
back in so the guy basically shredded

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,279
his hand because the eel tried to pull

393
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,740
his hand in and so what happened was

394
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,019
that was this guy and then I went back

395
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,639
to Fort Lauderdale and I went to the

396
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,199
dive shop and I was like yeah I went out

397
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,000
diving with you guys it's like oh yeah

398
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,220
the guy told us how he fought an eel I'm

399
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,740
like that's not what happened so anyway

400
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,240
it's kind of like the guy that caught

401
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,459
the fish this big That Got Away so

402
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,320
anyway and here's the thing that comes

403
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
back despite all these things going

404
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,060
wrong no training is ever waste of time

405
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,040
there's bad classes that I've taken

406
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,660
there's classes I thought were pretty

407
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
much a waste that I had to take but at

408
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,800
the end of the day what these classes

409
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,959
did was they breed you know they breed

410
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,600
skill and familiarity the more you're

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,579
underwater the more comfortable you are

412
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,860
the more training you have like I would

413
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,740
never think that that training I did for

414
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,199
the Magothy River Association where like

415
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,000
we had to put

416
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,600
um paper towels in our mask to Blind us

417
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,820
essentially because they wanted us to

418
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,560
train for zero visibility which

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,180
essentially what diving in some places

420
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,699
is so they trained us with that they

421
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,380
trained us how to get through obstacles

422
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,180
and there I was having to get through

423
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,480
obstacles to get out of a rock into a

424
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
dolphin tank and all this stuff kind of

425
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
comes together because the more you dive

426
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
the more comfortable you are the less

427
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,139
you'll panic and so on and know what to

428
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,420
do when things go wrong and then there's

429
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,860
also the question and you never know

430
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,360
when you're going to need your skills so

431
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,360
there was a during my rescue diver class

432
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,220
like our checkout Dives and this is

433
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,899
actually pretty funny except Somebody

434
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,000
almost got themselves killed during the

435
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,399
rescue diver class all of us were like

436
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,440
in this deep end of a quarry in the

437
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,139
middle of nowhere and out of the nowhere

438
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,920
this guy just pops up and freaking out

439
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,019
again tears off his mask throws the

440
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,420
regulator out exactly like what a panic

441
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,459
diver would be like and we're all

442
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,139
looking at each other there's eight of

443
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,480
us in this class and we're like is this

444
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
like a pop quiz or something like did

445
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,740
they put somebody down there to test us

446
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,079
and then it turns out this guy so then

447
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,060
he was like there and then you have and

448
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,920
the worst place to ever come up is in

449
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,259
the middle of a like first aid rescue

450
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,540
diver class in a panic because then you

451
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,400
have like eight people okay breathe

452
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,280
slowly do this calm down and I'm like I

453
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,439
just went away because that guy had more

454
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,179
than enough to worry about all these

455
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,740
people telling him to calm down was

456
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,880
going to freak him out more than

457
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,500
whatever he was freaked out at that

458
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,900
point and what happened was there he was

459
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,079
and it turns out that this diver he was

460
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,760
actually doing some what they call Tech

461
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
diving training which is like you know

462
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
multiple air tanks of different you know

463
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,880
different types of air and stuff like

464
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,799
that and apparently he was taking a

465
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,440
class freaked out and just popped up and

466
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
then all of a sudden we're all sitting

467
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,580
there thinking wait a second if he's the

468
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,960
student and then we're like where's your

469
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,299
buddy he's like oh it's just me and the

470
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,980
instructor then we're thinking do we

471
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,380
have to form rescue parties to go down

472
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,080
and find the instructor now and then all

473
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,820
of a sudden like three minutes later his

474
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,340
instructor oh I guess he just freaked

475
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,380
out and we're like instructor of the

476
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,020
Year material there so anyway

477
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,940
you know I had a son with BR like he

478
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,860
ended up having whooping cough and all

479
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,480
of a sudden it's like he was choking I

480
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,340
did the Heimlich maneuver I learned in

481
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,340
one of my rest in like emergency first

482
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,559
responder class it had nothing to do

483
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,240
with like stopping whooping cough but

484
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,580
apparently it helped get forcing air in

485
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,980
and out so that's like those skills I

486
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,840
mentioned getting corn on the Rocks then

487
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,400
there's other times there was one time I

488
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,500
was diving over in the Bahamas and all

489
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,320
of a sudden you look around and there's

490
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,200
like these eight foot Caribbean reef

491
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,380
sharks just swimming alongside the

492
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,380
divers now if you're not used to knowing

493
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,600
what to do it's really easy for somebody

494
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,580
to freak out thinking we're being

495
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,679
surrounded by a school of sharks being

496
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,380
hunted by them but if you know what

497
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,000
you're doing you're familiar with diving

498
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,039
you know the behavior of sharks it's

499
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,220
like hey wow this is really cool and you

500
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,740
can take pictures of it like I'm lucky

501
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,080
at the time I was diving with my ex-wife

502
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,600
and she was back there and I just like

503
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
waved to her to get her to wave and I

504
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,039
took a picture and she's like oh okay

505
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,720
then I showed her the picture when we

506
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
got back on the boat and and she's like

507
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,160
oh I go here's a picture of you waving

508
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,500
with a shark five feet behind you and

509
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,480
she like and she would have freaked out

510
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,980
if she knew that was going on at the

511
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,020
time but anyway then there's Braille

512
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,460
diving like I mentioned I call it

513
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,140
Braille diving with zero visibility

514
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,520
where you're just feeling the ground

515
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,500
trying to do stuff and so on getting

516
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,179
stuck with dolphins knowing what to do

517
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,820
what not to do but stopping at the end

518
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,799
of the day all of this I'm telling you

519
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,260
what's going wrong because stopping

520
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,440
stupid is a process and an ecosystem

521
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,780
everything that I just spoke about and

522
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,100
everybody's thinking I mean hopefully

523
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
you're starting to see the similarities

524
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,940
between what I'm talking about with

525
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,280
scuba diving and what actually happens

526
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,860
in cyber security as well because

527
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,080
stopping stupid much like scuba diving

528
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,760
it's a process

529
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,980
it's the same thing and it's not just a

530
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,780
process it's an ego system I saw this

531
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,700
article this morning when I thought I

532
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,100
had more time to than to come down here

533
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,140
I was reading this article by a woman at

534
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,080
nist and she was talking about oh how

535
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,419
companies ruined security awareness

536
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,580
training and how security awareness

537
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,440
training should be more approachable and

538
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
things like this and I'm sitting here

539
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,679
thinking it's like and you shouldn't

540
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,020
have like you know like it should be a

541
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,780
carrot not a stick and I'm sitting there

542
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,020
thinking you know what why is filling

543
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,419
out a time card and if you don't fill

544
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,220
out your time card you don't get paid

545
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,640
and that's okay by everybody but telling

546
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
somebody if they ruin the company's

547
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,419
Network they shouldn't be have some

548
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,039
repercussions for doing things they

549
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,260
shouldn't be doing you know the problem

550
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,820
is we're like looking at security

551
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,460
awareness as just tell people what to do

552
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,340
and in the right way and they'll do it

553
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,200
and if we're if they're not doing what

554
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,940
we tell them oh we must be doing it in

555
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,700
the wrong way no people will do stupid

556
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,179
things it's a given I promise you if I

557
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,280
send the message out that said this is a

558
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,020
phishing message and if you click this

559
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,600
message it will ruin your entire network

560
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,059
three percent of people will click that

561
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,240
message that's a given but what you need

562
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
is an ecosystem that expects three

563
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,679
percent of people to do something wrong

564
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,840
and that's essentially what the dive

565
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,360
Community has done because if you think

566
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,419
about it if diving like if we're relying

567
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,940
upon if three percent of divers go out

568
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,400
and get themselves killed or seriously

569
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,460
injured on a regular basis the diving

570
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,159
industry would end really really quickly

571
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,159
but yet it's created an ecosystem where

572
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,780
that doesn't happen and frankly you

573
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,880
could do yourself a lot more harm scuba

574
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,580
diving than using a computer anyway and

575
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,440
we still are able to have a safer

576
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,720
environment scuba diving than on our

577
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,980
computers

578
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,260
so there's a process and the process

579
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,360
starts from start to finish how you

580
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,580
train people to do things right how you

581
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,620
train the instructors to train people to

582
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,900
do things right and then the diving

583
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,120
providers in other words the people who

584
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,919
take people out in diving their

585
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,840
standards for them there are processes

586
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,539
for them and so on and all of this works

587
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,880
together with the diving instructors

588
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,740
and then throughout the whole industry

589
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,080
there's quality control and the reason

590
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,419
quality control is important is if

591
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,039
you're relying much like you have to

592
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,740
expect students to do something wrong

593
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,140
you have to expect

594
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,760
um dive professionals to do something

595
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,280
wrong as well so think about when you

596
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
try how many here are certified divers

597
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,299
just out of curiosity or ever went

598
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,419
diving okay only a few which well

599
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,980
surprisingly you're in the Cayman

600
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,600
Islands where everybody goes to get

601
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,159
diving I mean it's like in Maryland

602
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,799
everybody loves supposed to have crabs

603
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,299
there and only the Taurus really eat

604
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,700
those crabs from Phillips crab house so

605
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,080
anyway

606
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,039
um but to become a to to actually become

607
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,260
a certified diver the first thing you

608
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,360
have to do is take like dozens of hours

609
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,580
of training these days it's online

610
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,559
before you had to sit in a class for

611
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,179
like a couple weeks you know a few hours

612
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,640
a night but now you pretty much do all

613
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,980
your training online and the training at

614
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,960
the end of the day is proud not to get

615
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,299
yourself killed at the end of the day I

616
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,679
mean they teach you a little bit about

617
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,020
science Boyle's Law a little bit about

618
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,360
that that's just all fluff at the end

619
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,240
but really most of it is to tell you how

620
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,400
not to get yourself killed then what

621
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,400
happens is after you take the materials

622
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,980
then you're given a quiz and the quiz

623
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,080
basically goes ahead and says whether or

624
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,820
not you have retained enough information

625
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,640
on how not to get yourself killed and

626
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
they print you up a certificate then you

627
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,960
go to the dive shop of your choice say I

628
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
have passed my class now a smart school

629
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,960
will go ahead and say congratulations I

630
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,520
want you to sit down and take that test

631
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,940
again sorry I didn't even remember not

632
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,799
to shut my phone off that's how in a

633
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,500
hurry I was but anyway so there we were

634
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,780
and but a smart school will go ahead and

635
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,179
they will make the student retake the

636
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,659
test and why because you expect people

637
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,520
to have their friend who's a certified

638
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
diver take the test for them so they

639
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,440
don't have to sit through it so a smart

640
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
dive school will make sure they watch

641
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,760
the people take the test and then once

642
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,260
you do that then you fill out a medical

643
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,940
form before they put you in the water

644
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,919
and the medical form is supposed to make

645
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,179
sure you're not going to have a heart

646
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,620
attack you're not going to have a stroke

647
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,360
when you get in the water and you're not

648
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,820
otherwise impaired and then you take

649
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,059
actual swimming or water test and then

650
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,320
what they want you to do is they want

651
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,480
you to like swim like 200 yards it

652
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,760
doesn't matter how you do it I mean

653
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,559
frankly you could just like do doggy

654
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,320
paddle and whatever and that qualifies

655
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
then they want you to float in the water

656
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,700
I think it's for like three minutes or

657
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,039
10 minutes I can't remember how much do

658
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
they really care I mean that's what all

659
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,340
the scuba equipment's for the only

660
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
reason we want people to do that is to

661
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,299
make sure they're not going to freak out

662
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,299
in the Water by default that is the only

663
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,059
reason it has no skills requirement it's

664
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,919
really just to examine their mental

665
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
state and comfort in water then once we

666
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,539
do that we teach them all the com you

667
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,220
know how to set up the equipment how to

668
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,260
do things you do it around the pool area

669
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,140
or other really very kind area and

670
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,400
that's one thing

671
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,740
and then once they pass that then you

672
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,000
say great we're going to take you to

673
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,919
open water in pretty much a confined

674
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
area have you go through all the skills

675
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,600
again and do everything specifically

676
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,179
and what that does is does that make

677
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,880
somebody a great diver the answer is no

678
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
frankly before you have 10 scuba Dives

679
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,980
in you kind of really suck at diving

680
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,320
it's a given because you have to like

681
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,600
control your buoyancy intuitively and

682
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,100
things like how you flow through the

683
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,480
water that you're not going to go

684
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,820
drastically up or drastically down it

685
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,340
just takes a while and that's okay but

686
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,659
it doesn't mean that you're a great

687
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,100
diver it doesn't mean you're not going

688
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,140
to get yourself killed really at the end

689
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,640
of the day it just means that maybe

690
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,159
that's oh no anyway it just means that

691
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,260
you're not going to go ahead and die by

692
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,080
default you at least know how to do it

693
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,779
safely but anyway then like the cold

694
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,640
dive profession they went together and

695
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,860
had like a curriculum developed like

696
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,140
what are safe skills to learn at

697
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,360
different times so you know they have a

698
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,159
few of the fun things like for kids like

699
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,140
the bubble maker steel team discover

700
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,480
scuba diving which is really just okay

701
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,140
here's put yourself in a tank in a like

702
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,820
reasonable area not get yourself killed

703
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,159
then you know the Specialties you can

704
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,200
learn then how to work your way through

705
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,080
professional ranks now the thing is most

706
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,940
people you don't really have to know

707
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,820
anything besides open water diving but

708
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,520
another thing is there are if you work

709
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,740
with good dive providers which

710
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,299
unfortunately a lot of dive providers

711
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,460
don't want to do the check like they

712
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,779
should if they're going to take you

713
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,940
below 60 feet make sure you're at least

714
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,740
you know an adventure diver

715
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,900
certification if you're going to go

716
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,000
below 100 feet they better make sure you

717
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,220
have a deep dive certification or

718
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,620
something like that because you really

719
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,960
have to know things to do right and do

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
you really have to know it anybody could

721
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,460
go 100 feet because in general around

722
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,100
here being down like in the Cayman

723
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,440
Islands being down 30 feet and being

724
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,320
down like 130 feet is pretty much the

725
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,480
same for the most part you just get a

726
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,700
little less fish as you go deeper but

727
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,799
it's really a nice gradual dive and it

728
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,260
looks the same but people have to do

729
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,020
things and train you and expect and put

730
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,419
you in situations that at least you're

731
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,360
certified to be put into a dive operator

732
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,159
can ignore it but if somebody gets

733
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,200
themselves killed and I could tell you

734
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,059
like if I'm out on a dive and somebody

735
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,279
injures themselves in 70 feet of water

736
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,799
and what happens is all of a sudden they

737
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,140
go back they sue them and they say well

738
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,299
why did you take this person out to 70

739
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,880
feet he's only an Open Water diver and

740
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,860
an Open Water diver without having a

741
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,200
deep water training dive is not allowed

742
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,320
shouldn't be allowed to go below 60 feet

743
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,880
and so on and that could come back to

744
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,620
bite them but they don't want to turn

745
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,720
people away in many cases and that's a

746
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,539
risk that each dive provider has so

747
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,340
we'll go back to that later

748
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,380
then there's risk management throughout

749
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,840
the process when I teach people to dive

750
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,940
when I have to do things there are

751
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,919
training standards developed like if I

752
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,960
take people in the water I'm only

753
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,179
allowed as an instructor to take eight

754
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,880
people in the water at a time sometimes

755
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,679
it's limited to four people in the water

756
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,659
unless I bring the Dive Master with me

757
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,299
depending upon the age of the divers and

758
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,940
so on and then they keep doing and then

759
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,279
what happens is as there are incidents

760
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,400
they keep revising the standards they

761
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,919
keep saying okay well this happened this

762
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,539
hasn't happened we think it's a safe

763
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,820
risk to do this we've seen an incident

764
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,799
where somebody did this so then go ahead

765
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,840
and we'll you know you have to modify

766
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,820
that and so on you know the course

767
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,620
curriculum has been developed and

768
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,960
refined what goes into the training what

769
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,299
goes into the Dives I have here let's

770
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,580
see does that work so these cards here

771
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,279
are over here those are cue cards that

772
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,500
when I take people down to certify them

773
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,840
as a diver or to teach them as a diver

774
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,279
and open water for advanced

775
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,100
certifications these cue cards tell me

776
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,919
exactly what I'm supposed to do what

777
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,320
skills I'm supposed to generate for that

778
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,140
course at that time and these cue cards

779
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,720
that they print up take it with me so I

780
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,960
I can't forget them theoretically risk

781
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
Management's embedded in every step you

782
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
have insurance this those cards I

783
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,919
mentioned instructors I have to be

784
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,140
certified to take people in as an

785
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,659
emergency First Responders certified you

786
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,580
know usually you have to be an efr

787
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,799
instructor as well we have to have first

788
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,140
aid kits we have to have oxygen kits we

789
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,700
have to have aeds like you know the

790
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,460
heart palpitation devices that have to

791
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,500
be with us at all times in case

792
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,940
something goes wrong we have to know

793
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,799
where the hospitals are the hyperbaric

794
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,440
chambers and this all goes into every

795
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,179
time we teach why do we have to know

796
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,340
that because they've examined all this

797
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,340
data on what has gone wrong and how do

798
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,679
we manage all this risk despite the fact

799
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,440
things will go wrong anyway but how is

800
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,179
the risk reason reasonably well

801
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,760
contained so this is all built into the

802
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
standards now I have this slide because

803
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,340
this is an example I'm going to assume

804
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,100
just for the case this person here is a

805
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,760
student the one on the left side this is

806
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,320
the instructor watching that person

807
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,620
trying to do a fin pivot and then you

808
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,419
can see like all these other people are

809
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,919
sitting around and while the instructor

810
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,200
has to look at one person at a time

811
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,020
which is potentially dangerous because

812
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,720
people will do stupid things and I

813
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,760
actually was in this situation and in

814
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,860
the corner of my eye somebody like here

815
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,440
just like hey let's look under the

816
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,960
platform to see what's there despite the

817
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,240
fact we tell them stay on the platform

818
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,120
until we swim around somebody is always

819
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,299
going to want to look under the platform

820
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,760
I promise that because people do stupid

821
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,140
things

822
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,720
anyway what happens is if you do good

823
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,460
risk management like I mentioned before

824
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,419
when I'm a teacher if I can especially

825
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,340
when I have more than four people or

826
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,620
frankly more than two people if I have

827
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,200
to you know a smart instructor will

828
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360
bring another person a Dive Master or

829
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,940
assistant instructor around to go ahead

830
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,640
and watch everybody also when you take

831
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,860
them on the actual scuba dive afterwards

832
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,380
that person stays behind and follows

833
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,179
everybody behind to make sure they don't

834
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,919
like get lost and do other things

835
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,899
because people you know it's kind of

836
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,299
like you know squirrel chasing and

837
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,460
things sometimes and stuff but anyway

838
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,940
that's what you do then also embedded in

839
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,740
everything is insurance at every step

840
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,140
what dive organizations do is they make

841
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,179
sure everybody's insured they get cheap

842
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,620
insurance rates the instructors

843
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,200
insurance insured the school is insured

844
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,419
the dive site's insured the bone and the

845
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,399
staff are insured and then there's even

846
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,559
a policy we take out on students the

847
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,080
students don't know that we ensure all

848
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,299
all of the students so if something goes

849
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,039
wrong with them we don't know if they

850
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,840
have health insurance or not that's not

851
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,940
one of the questions but we take out

852
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,220
like a policy like twenty dollars per

853
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,720
student that they don't know we're

854
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,520
paying for them in case they get injured

855
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
so insurance and is risk management and

856
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,500
that's embedded everywhere and like I

857
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,779
said before a certification doesn't mean

858
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,899
a diver is a safe diver it means we have

859
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,840
certified that at least they know how to

860
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,299
be a safe diver if they follow what

861
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,820
we've taught them and that should be the

862
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,399
same for cyber security users we should

863
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,919
be able to say look we know users are

864
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,559
going to do really stupid things but

865
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,539
we're not going to be stupider than they

866
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,700
are we're going to acknowledge that they

867
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,740
do stupid things and we're going to

868
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,120
train them to the best of the ability

869
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,980
but we're going to put in infrastructure

870
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,380
behind them to make sure that their

871
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,899
stupidity does not ruin the company but

872
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,700
again all we know is that they are

873
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,580
certified that they know how not to kill

874
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,620
themselves they know it it's not worth

875
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,940
saying they're never going to kill

876
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,980
themselves but then training the

877
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,140
instructors and I had that big diagram a

878
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,240
few slides back you know there's the

879
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,980
first level of professional was a Dive

880
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,840
Master and everybody thinks like the

881
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,460
Dive Master is something like really

882
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,039
special at the end of the day 80 percent

883
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,220
of Dive Master training is like show me

884
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,580
you can do a fin pivot at a level four

885
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,039
or five out of five show me you can take

886
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,019
off and remove your equipment at a level

887
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,600
four out of five or a level four or five

888
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,120
that's a 80 percent of Dive Master

889
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,039
training there's a little bit on safety

890
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,399
there's a little bit on dive industry

891
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,980
business and so on but most of it is

892
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,240
just to make sure that they have

893
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,460
perfected it there's also the assumption

894
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,960
that they've already taken a rescue

895
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,940
diver class that they've already been

896
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,980
efr started you know emergency First

897
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,659
Response certified which means they know

898
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,059
how to give CPR how to do basic first

899
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,640
aid and so on how to handle emergencies

900
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,940
but basically 90 80 percent is really

901
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,399
just basic diving skills the one thing

902
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,620
that is horrid and the hardest thing I

903
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,899
ever had to do in dive training and it

904
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,299
sounds simple at the time where you have

905
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,880
to go down in a pool with a buddy and

906
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,620
you have to completely exchange

907
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,600
equipment with each other while buddy

908
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,899
breathing that sounds really simple I

909
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,699
asked my Navy SEAL friend how he did

910
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,260
he's like oh yeah I just took a big D

911
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,659
you know I just took a big gulp of air

912
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,639
and then I would just take my equipment

913
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,440
off I let the other guy keep doing it

914
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,119
whenever I needed more air the guy would

915
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,159
give me his air and so on and I thought

916
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,980
that's what I'm gonna do God was that

917
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,619
the stupidest thing I ever thought but I

918
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,020
mean I am not the same training as this

919
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,418
my Navy SEAL friend I thought it would

920
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,820
be easy it wasn't so anyway there's a

921
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,320
lot of people who blow Dive Master

922
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,659
training on just that test and why do

923
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,099
they actually do that

924
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:45,418
it's not about really a hard skill it's

925
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,000
really about will you panic

926
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,820
that is the most thing because some of

927
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,219
the tests are not obvious on what

928
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,619
they're trying to get at people students

929
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,080
floating in a pool again the primary

930
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,700
goal for students floating in the pool

931
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,960
they're not going to freak out in the

932
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,900
water the primary thing that a scuba a

933
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,700
Dive Master exchanging equipment while

934
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,339
body breathing is that they can control

935
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,740
their Panic they can control their fear

936
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,140
that's what that test is for if you ask

937
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,180
me but then you have the instructors

938
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,460
instructor training again as how to do

939
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,859
basic skills how to teach people how to

940
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,720
recognize students doing things wrong

941
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,660
and so on a lot is legal responsibility

942
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,180
a lot is quality control you know

943
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,220
Advanced certifications and so on then

944
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,020
amass the scuba diver trainer which is

945
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,240
what I'm at it's really just a scuba

946
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,760
instructor who's done 25 certifications

947
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,460
and can train on five Specialties which

948
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,500
I'm shocked all scuba instructors aren't

949
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,420
because it's really easy but anyway

950
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,460
that's what I'm and then instructor

951
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,560
trainers they have like higher levels

952
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,839
and course directors so certified the

953
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,000
actual instructors they're the primary

954
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,920
Gatekeepers if you want to call it that

955
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,140
and they also do quality control of all

956
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,420
the other people involved but ultimately

957
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,700
being a professional like in cyber

958
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,160
security should be about here adhering

959
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,099
to an enforcing standards and that again

960
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,540
is what a good cyber security

961
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,000
professional should be doing as well oh

962
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,339
yeah sorry I just ruined my joke what do

963
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,839
you call the person that bottoms at the

964
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,520
it graduates at the bottom of their

965
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,260
medical school class

966
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,599
doctor you know what do you call an

967
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,220
instructor that's at the bottom of their

968
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,060
class

969
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,760
instructor so on what do you call a

970
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,440
cyber security professional who doesn't

971
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,480
even take a class a cyber security

972
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,400
professional that's the unfortunate part

973
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
so anyway

974
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,900
dive agency sort of you know certifying

975
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,000
a pro that just means that they believe

976
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,700
the dive Pro is acceptable to put the

977
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,359
entire industry at risk cyber security

978
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,400
people are putting their entire company

979
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,440
at risk theoretically much in the same

980
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,960
way but really if I'm an instructor

981
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,500
people have said it's okay for me to put

982
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,660
the whole dive industry at risk and why

983
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,240
is that what happens when people die and

984
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,300
during scuba diving

985
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,240
I mean the stories go all over the place

986
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,880
they make movies about it what was this

987
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,339
movie Blue Water or something where a

988
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,079
dive boat leaves two student you know

989
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,900
two divers behind that freaked people

990
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,000
out that's a really good way to ruin the

991
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,920
whole dive profession

992
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,320
you know you see all these Megalodon you

993
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,200
know the Meg and Meg too like about big

994
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,240
sharks eating people going underwater

995
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,119
that's really not good publicity for the

996
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,180
dive industry and when somebody kills

997
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,700
themselves scuba diving it's really

998
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,440
really a bad thing and I would argue

999
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,300
that when there's a major cyber security

1000
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,940
incident it doesn't reflect on our

1001
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,500
profession well

1002
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,599
think about it when you have like a

1003
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,700
major ransomware attack it's like why

1004
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,500
didn't their security people do anything

1005
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,079
when you had the Equifax breach it's

1006
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,320
like oh they had a music Major in charge

1007
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,900
of their cyber security program and

1008
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,220
things like that there were other

1009
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,260
problems and I'm not saying that the you

1010
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,480
know but they go ahead and will tear you

1011
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,000
apart when there's a major incident dive

1012
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,339
operators they take people on trips they

1013
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,800
fill air tanks they basically allow

1014
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,839
people to dive if they're going to be an

1015
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,520
independent diver like it could go to a

1016
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,619
dive shop here rent equipment and then

1017
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,300
say I'm just going to go off a beach and

1018
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,220
they'll let you provide equipment

1019
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,020
maintain equipment and so on but what's

1020
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,880
risk management for them when you walk

1021
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
into a dive shop a good dive shop should

1022
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,740
go ahead and check your certifications

1023
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,079
test they want to see your card or they

1024
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,000
can look it up online they'll ask

1025
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
medical questions unfortunately I didn't

1026
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,780
get a medical questionnaire so bet on

1027
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,940
them they'll ask the date of your last

1028
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,500
dive and why do they want to do that

1029
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,599
because if you haven't Dove within the

1030
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,700
standard is two years years you should

1031
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,680
get a refresher class frankly for many

1032
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,960
people it's six months to get

1033
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,359
um because you know you just might not

1034
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,800
be comfortable they don't know your use

1035
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,780
of equipment how many times have you

1036
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,359
Dove like if you've Dove 300 times you

1037
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,160
haven't Dove for like six months you're

1038
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,740
probably okay if you've only Dove like

1039
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,320
you know five times and the last time

1040
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,420
you Dove was two years on a trip they

1041
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,740
really need to make sure they give you

1042
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,260
help and stuff like that so anyway they

1043
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,700
want to check your equipment to make

1044
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,500
sure everything's safe they have to have

1045
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,900
insurance on everything responsible dive

1046
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,820
operations like you if you're on a boat

1047
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,440
they should be calling off people's

1048
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,300
names they should be have a Dive Master

1049
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,980
in the water with you a certified

1050
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,839
captain and so on they should know where

1051
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,520
the medical facilities are they should

1052
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,980
have oxygen first aid and so on in case

1053
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,599
she gets oh yeah I've also been stung by

1054
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,300
a jellyfish that kind of sucks and that

1055
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,579
pissed me off too because I got I I was

1056
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,440
actually I was I was scuba diving in

1057
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,000
Oman It's actually an interesting story

1058
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,700
and they took us to this Cove and the

1059
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,000
Cove was filled with gel fish and I

1060
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,380
didn't think that there was any place

1061
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,540
like this except for like in Fiji or

1062
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,400
somewhere like that and then I'm like

1063
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,200
and the only place I heard that you

1064
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
could go swimming with jellyfishes in

1065
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,920
this Cove in Fiji where they're all

1066
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,420
stuck in everything and don't have

1067
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,579
tentacles and what happens is we get

1068
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,020
there the guy's like oh yeah it's safe

1069
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,880
they won't sting you and I'm like

1070
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,740
sitting there and I'm watching everybody

1071
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,440
else go off the boat before I do and I'm

1072
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,760
like just sitting there pretending to

1073
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,740
check my air the guy's like are you okay

1074
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm like oh yeah I'm just you know I

1075
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,740
just want to make sure I didn't hear

1076
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,020
screaming before I went in myself that's

1077
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,359
my risk management then I finally go in

1078
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,160
and then we're coming back in the cove

1079
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,380
and I get there and what happens is all

1080
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,420
of a sudden I feel a really painful

1081
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,140
thing on my hand and I go back to the

1082
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,240
dive boat because it's right there and

1083
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,619
then he's like oh yeah you should be

1084
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,500
more careful I'm like looking for a

1085
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,020
stinging jellyfish in a lagoon with a

1086
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,720
hundred thousand jellyfish he's like

1087
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,160
yeah I'm like

1088
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,200
Dive Master of the year right there

1089
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,740
people anyway so quality control quality

1090
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,440
control is embedded within the entire

1091
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,000
industry there's major scuba

1092
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,520
organizations like Patty like SSI and so

1093
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,920
on and these people whenever there's an

1094
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,599
incident they go back and investigate

1095
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,579
the incident they figured out what

1096
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,500
happened what were the enabling factors

1097
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,839
and when you do incident responses you

1098
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,820
should be doing the exact same thing

1099
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,920
when a user clicks on a phishing message

1100
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,200
you should be asking yourself why did

1101
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,700
that user click on a phishing message

1102
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,440
and I'll give you a quick aside I was

1103
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,240
once investigating if you actually want

1104
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,940
something funny Google Ira Winkler and

1105
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,800
Syrian electronic Army and you could

1106
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,599
throw in cockroach it's a really good

1107
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,099
you know you can do that now while

1108
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,960
you're waiting but anyway I would

1109
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,119
investigate Syrian electronic armians

1110
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,060
and army hacking incidents and one of

1111
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,560
them they broke into a multi-billion

1112
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,839
dollar company and one of the people who

1113
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,880
fell for a phishing message was the CFO

1114
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,460
I went to the CFO I go this looks like

1115
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,560
an obvious phishing message I go this is

1116
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,180
going to sound bad but you're a smart

1117
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,760
guy why did you fall for this crap and

1118
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,920
the guy was like well I woke up at 6am

1119
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,920
in the morning opened up my iPhone saw a

1120
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,420
message saying we were mentioned in the

1121
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,760
BBC the guy by the Chant by the way was

1122
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,859
British working in New York they really

1123
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,200
targeted a guy he's like I opened it up

1124
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,839
and I clicked on the link and entered my

1125
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,060
credentials I'm like well

1126
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,040
don't you know how to check for a

1127
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,320
malicious links on your iPhone he's like

1128
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,579
no

1129
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,680
and then we went through all their top

1130
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,660
tier cyber security awareness training

1131
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,820
and none of the videos they had them

1132
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,859
watch or any of the training said

1133
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,480
anything about how to check for the

1134
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,000
validity of links on mobile devices so

1135
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,560
we had to put an emergency cyber

1136
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,960
security program in place on how to

1137
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,540
check militia for malicious links on

1138
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,240
mobile devices as an example and those

1139
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,040
are only things you do when you do a

1140
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,980
detailed incident investigation down to

1141
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,680
why did people do something you think is

1142
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,200
stupid and so on and that's what dive

1143
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,780
industry does they handle complaints

1144
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,599
about teachers doing bad things and a

1145
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,940
God I can give them dozens of complaints

1146
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,160
there's a disciplinary process where

1147
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,020
they go ahead and investigate they can

1148
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,119
pull or suspend certifications of

1149
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,359
instructors professionals dive or dive

1150
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,940
operators and so on they do periodic

1151
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
inspections and this is built into

1152
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,140
everything that's done just to make sure

1153
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,720
the industry is not going to go out of

1154
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,520
business because somebody leaves someone

1155
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,040
body in a dive site or somebody gets

1156
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,599
somebody killed because they took a

1157
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,819
first-time diver and put them in 130

1158
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:12,960
feet of water

1159
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,720
so anyway if there is a lawsuit with all

1160
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,000
the risk management in place they

1161
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,859
contact insurance they go ahead they

1162
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,540
cite training standards like if somebody

1163
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,240
gets harmed they go back there's cars

1164
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,220
that student when I certify people there

1165
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,920
are cards that Patty prints up that has

1166
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,560
students initial that yes they have they

1167
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,720
are initially that yes I made sure they

1168
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,339
know how to do this skill this skill

1169
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,619
this skill this skill because if

1170
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,359
somebody gets killed their family will

1171
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,400
try to sue who's ever there I'm not

1172
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,740
saying rightfully or wrongfully so but

1173
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,420
they will try to sue them and they will

1174
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,180
drag everybody in from start to finish

1175
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,460
the person who first certified that

1176
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,460
person 20 years ago will be part of the

1177
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,619
lawsuit and then you have to break out

1178
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,420
the trading cards and said well this

1179
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,460
person died because they didn't you know

1180
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,819
do a slow ascent and they initial that

1181
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,859
they were told how to do a slow ascent

1182
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,540
and I witnessed them doing a slow Ascend

1183
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,060
so therefore they knew what to do they

1184
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,220
just didn't do it and I'm off the hook

1185
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,099
by and that that's the type of things

1186
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,079
that you have to do from a risk

1187
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,060
management perspective where the dive

1188
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,520
industry is really teetering on one

1189
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,800
incident and just for example when

1190
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,180
you're talking about that how many

1191
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,640
people heard of Steve Irwin Crocodile

1192
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,200
Hunter

1193
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,440
how was Steve Irwin killed

1194
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Stingray you have people stepping on

1195
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,380
stingrays hunt thousands of people A Day

1196
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,780
stepping on stingrays not getting killed

1197
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,880
how was Steve Irwin got killed and this

1198
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,740
we you know they did an after accident

1199
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,319
and because I was a volunteer diver for

1200
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,940
the National Aquarium in Baltimore they

1201
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,560
actually went through this because we

1202
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,200
dove with stingrays on a daily basis and

1203
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,540
what they said was they put a camera in

1204
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,640
front of a stingray on the bottom of the

1205
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,980
water and then Steve Irwin wanted to

1206
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,839
come on top so it looked like a cool

1207
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,020
picture of Steve Irwin diving of coming

1208
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,300
right into the camera on top of the

1209
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,700
stingray so there you had a stingray

1210
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,940
trapped with a guy six inches above him

1211
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,640
hovering over him trapping him and a

1212
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,020
stingray what's the first thing they do

1213
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,900
they jump and their tail goes up and

1214
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,940
they try to run away that's what

1215
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,240
happened that's why Steve Irwin

1216
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,760
Advanced Medical Handler got himself

1217
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,160
killed and that's what happens when

1218
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,940
people do stupid things in so anyway

1219
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,700
so oh yeah and and besides all this

1220
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,740
people hate compliance compliance seems

1221
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,900
like a holes sorry I'm not cursing that

1222
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,300
much today I'm trying not to but diving

1223
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,880
is statistically safer than bowling that

1224
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,260
is a true story

1225
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,359
so anyway keep that in mind when you

1226
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:49,920
start looking at all the standards all

1227
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,839
the compliance all the quality controls

1228
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,599
and so on the whole industry and this is

1229
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,220
why I'm saying this the whole industry

1230
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,920
is basically relying upon each other

1231
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,619
that if somebody does something right or

1232
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,260
wrong it can seriously impact the whole

1233
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,900
industry if somebody if a dive operator

1234
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,640
gives people bad equipment that just

1235
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
fails at 100 feet that's going to ruin

1236
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,720
it because it will be news stories they

1237
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,579
will make movies out of this and so on

1238
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,339
it's a five billion dollar industry that

1239
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,020
doesn't include the tourism that doesn't

1240
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,400
include for example all the people

1241
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,859
traveling here to Grand Cayman and other

1242
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,859
places you know it's all because of risk

1243
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,140
management from start to finish and the

1244
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,359
organizations that oversee this that

1245
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,920
really go ahead and maintain the whole

1246
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,660
industry oh yeah I know it's three

1247
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,579
minutes 40 seconds by the way not five

1248
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,920
so anyway if one element fails they're

1249
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
all gonna fail that's cyber security so

1250
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,780
General lessons science is embedded in

1251
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,359
everything in diving by the way you know

1252
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,700
don't panic the small stuff because you

1253
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,099
will have like leaky air mass you will

1254
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,660
have leaky Mass you will have like

1255
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,880
equipment that isn't operating perfectly

1256
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,099
and stuff and you just go ahead and go

1257
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:57,960
with the flow and mellow out on the

1258
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,460
other hand sometimes the small stuff

1259
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,460
rally really can become big stuff where

1260
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,020
if all of a sudden you see like a slow

1261
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,720
leak and sometimes a hose will pop all

1262
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,060
of a sudden so you got to make sure that

1263
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,220
those things are accounted for it takes

1264
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,780
a while to get things right like I

1265
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,880
mentioned new scuba divers new scuba

1266
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,680
divers no matter what no matter how good

1267
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,780
they think they are they're going to be

1268
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,420
a mess for like the first 10 to 25 Dives

1269
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,060
also the big thing the things that sound

1270
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,099
really really cool aren't like I could

1271
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,040
tell you for example that deep diving to

1272
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,560
me really sucks you know going down like

1273
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,540
everybody was asking me so how low do

1274
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,700
you go I'm like well I've gone 130 feet

1275
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
they're like wow that's cool like oh no

1276
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,000
it really sucks there's not a lot of

1277
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,619
light there there's not a lot of coral

1278
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:42,839
there basically all the cool stuff is

1279
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,880
like you know 30 to 60 feet in general

1280
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,859
that's where I really like to dive

1281
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,020
there's another guy we were on a dive

1282
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,359
trip Christopher peacock is on this trip

1283
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,819
and there was this guy who was wearing a

1284
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:56,940
dive knife on his leg which looks really

1285
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,280
cool he was even wearing it exactly

1286
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,900
where they tell you on the inside of the

1287
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,780
leg so you can pull it out only a douche

1288
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,020
sorry I'm trying not to curse but only a

1289
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,079
only a loser really carries a dive knife

1290
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,460
if they're not going to do stuff like

1291
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,619
when I would maintain oysters and stuff

1292
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,900
I have like a knife that I just have by

1293
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,819
default there you know with a flashlight

1294
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,040
and stuff but you don't go around you

1295
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,780
know like I have this all this equipment

1296
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,579
look around for the people that have

1297
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:26,160
like 500 Dives none of them has a dive

1298
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,740
knife if you have to rescue a sea turtle

1299
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,800
from fishing line sure but the average

1300
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,440
diver especially with 25 Dives is not

1301
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,540
going to go ahead and rescue a whale I

1302
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,220
promise that you know don't get

1303
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,560
overwhelmed time take time to think when

1304
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,680
things go wrong stop and breathe stop

1305
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,079
and consider what's going on you know

1306
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,359
never can be too well trained and also

1307
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,400
you need the 10-foot view you also need

1308
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
the 10 000 foot View and that's in cyber

1309
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,839
security especially because when you're

1310
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,480
diving and I'm gonna show a picture

1311
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,000
um oh yeah 30 feet I'll come back to the

1312
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,060
that one later but 30 feet can be really

1313
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,240
awesome and it can really suck I did my

1314
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,359
checkout Dives in skinny Atlas Lake in

1315
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,720
15 feet of water where the visibility

1316
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,420
was about five feet and the temperature

1317
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,140
of the water was 41 degrees that really

1318
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,859
really really sucks to put it mildly but

1319
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,839
the reality is when somebody says oh 30

1320
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,760
feet it's not the depth that everybody

1321
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,859
thinks of you got to look at the overall

1322
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,420
conditions that say if something's good

1323
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,460
or bad now going back to the 10-foot

1324
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,920
view on the 100 foot view we were diving

1325
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,079
earlier this week I guess it was Tuesday

1326
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,119
and what happened was it was near the

1327
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,740
end of the dive I was running low on air

1328
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,839
so I stay higher because that conserves

1329
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,460
air a little bit better and what

1330
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,859
happened was everybody else this was low

1331
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,660
down looking at the coral and everything

1332
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,359
and because I was up higher I was able

1333
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,119
to see something that people wasn't and

1334
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,040
all of a sudden so anyway if you can

1335
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,020
look there there's actually like an

1336
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,300
eagle ray and it looks really really and

1337
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,920
that's actually probably like six to

1338
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,200
eight feet wide but nobody else was able

1339
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,400
to see that because they were looking

1340
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,319
down on the coral

1341
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:09,240
and so finally we had got the

1342
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,040
instructors or the dive Masters

1343
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,380
attention and he was able to go ahead

1344
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,880
and get every you know a few people to

1345
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,280
get the attention but that only happens

1346
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,920
when you're looking carefully at the

1347
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,020
things that matter to most people but

1348
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,180
you're also looking around all the time

1349
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,579
and taking a higher level View

1350
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,380
so anyway there's another thing I'll

1351
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,660
quickly say because I'm I'm out of time

1352
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,160
but he did give me another minute 20

1353
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,280
seconds nobody I asked my friends to the

1354
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,619
Navy SEAL that I mentioned and so I was

1355
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,480
I use them on Consulting assignments for

1356
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,700
physical security and one of the clients

1357
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,260
like you know they like talking to Navy

1358
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,579
Seals because they think it makes them

1359
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,900
sound cool because they're talking to

1360
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,240
them and they asked to do so which was

1361
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,819
harder the training you went through or

1362
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:53,819
being in the field and Stu's like and I

1363
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,440
was expecting Stu to say the training

1364
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,940
like with all the hell they put them

1365
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,339
through literally and through surprising

1366
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,099
he's like he goes oh being in the field

1367
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,500
easily I go what

1368
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,780
he's like nobody ever pulled me out of

1369
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,819
the water when I had hypothermia when I

1370
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,339
was trying to mine chips you know that

1371
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,500
type of stuff and that's the type of

1372
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,420
thing you don't think about so again the

1373
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,819
training as hard as you can get is

1374
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:19,980
really really important because that way

1375
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,599
you're trained for when things go really

1376
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,760
really wrong I do want to go ahead I

1377
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,559
don't really have time to go in but

1378
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,540
Patty one of the certifying people joke

1379
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,880
like my the course director I had who

1380
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,859
was a combustion he's like yeah Patty

1381
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,599
should stand for put another dollar in

1382
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,880
and I'm like thinking that put another

1383
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,040
dollar in is the only thing keeping you

1384
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,420
in business

1385
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,300
because he was able to go ahead and like

1386
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,220
he made a lot of business by going to

1387
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,440
different colleges around Maryland and

1388
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,300
teaching the students at those colleges

1389
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,400
scuba diving and the only reason he was

1390
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,800
able to do that was Patty spent a lot of

1391
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,700
money

1392
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,720
to have scuba diving as a as a class

1393
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,700
that goes ahead and is able to get

1394
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,579
college credit for and that allowed that

1395
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,859
had colleges them wanting to bring scuba

1396
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,800
diving in if nothing else that one thing

1397
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
he hated paying them money for was what

1398
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,940
made his whole business whether he

1399
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,800
wanted to admit it or not and there's a

1400
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,300
whole bunch of other stuff I don't have

1401
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,220
time to go into I'll leave you with this

1402
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,960
thought this and this was actually I saw

1403
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,780
this when I was taking flight lessons

1404
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,940
and you know it said this the sign of an

1405
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,160
outstanding diver is one who never gets

1406
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,720
into a position where they have to use

1407
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,240
their outstanding skills you know I saw

1408
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,099
it originally where it said pilot but

1409
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,900
anyway same thing with diving same thing

1410
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,819
with cyber security professional don't

1411
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,020
get in the position where you have to

1412
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,119
use your outstanding skills again for

1413
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,500
lack of a better term if you haven't got

1414
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,240
it now pretty much everything I said

1415
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,800
replaced scuba diving with cyber

1416
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,800
security and today I just love this one

1417
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,200
so I had to add that otherwise for your

1418
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,819
reading pleasure those are my books buy

1419
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,099
them they're awesome and thanks I don't

1420
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:54,540
think I have time for questions but if

1421
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,339
they want me to I'll take them

1422
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,119
well you

1423
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,260
oh

1424
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,780
yeah oh she has a question I'll do that

1425
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,640
because nobody else is here now you can

1426
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,259
start getting on uh anyway go ahead

1427
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:16,520
don't take

1428
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,619
care of the Educators

1429
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,599
um they're aware of the typical threats

1430
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,400
um however the waters and temperatures

1431
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,839
change

1432
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,660
um how does one prepare for that no

1433
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,940
different than unknown cyber security

1434
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,540
friends in addition to the training

1435
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,480
um the ever-changing landscape

1436
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,140
um obviously

1437
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,520
sorry okay

1438
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,460
um so in addition to the training and

1439
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,079
the forever changing landscape with

1440
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,599
respect to cyber security what are your

1441
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,000
best practice recommendations on how

1442
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,059
often you should provide training for

1443
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,400
your end users no different than you

1444
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,119
would for uh diving and refresh courses

1445
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,280
so that's actually a question I have

1446
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,720
really really strong opinions having

1447
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
written security awareness for dummies

1448
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,960
and you can't stop stupid I'm a big

1449
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,640
believer in security awareness so don't

1450
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,579
get me wrong the problem is it's they

1451
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,140
look at it they're trying to make a

1452
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,200
tactic strategy security awareness is a

1453
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,720
tactic within a larger strategy to

1454
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,819
mitigate the whole concept of user risk

1455
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:27,119
much like teaching people how to dive is

1456
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,059
a tactic in making a strategy of a safe

1457
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,440
dive industry

1458
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,500
So to that thing what's the right period

1459
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,619
there should be both passive and um

1460
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,319
sorry passive and active methods of

1461
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,780
training people you should have constant

1462
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,280
reminders throughout you should have

1463
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,140
nudges embedded you should have good

1464
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,660
like for example email messages should

1465
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,240
make use of those um banners let's say

1466
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,220
external message versus internal message

1467
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,800
and so on that's a constant reminder for

1468
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,599
people to be on the lookout you should

1469
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,700
have people for example you know like

1470
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,800
posters newsletters they're not

1471
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,380
they're not great but they provide some

1472
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,960
sort of reminder and then you do have to

1473
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,940
have because of Industry standards you

1474
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,380
have to have monthly training or

1475
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,059
whatever your Auditors tell you to have

1476
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,760
I frankly think the quality is more

1477
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,640
important than the quali quantity

1478
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,740
and I think most security awareness

1479
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,040
training sucks royally to put it mildly

1480
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,099
and bad training is useless and frankly

1481
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,800
harmful because people people are

1482
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,839
offended by taking bad train I should

1483
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,540
not have to take my sock manager and

1484
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,280
give him the same training I'm giving to

1485
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,960
the person in the mail room

1486
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,640
and that's what we're doing in this

1487
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,660
profession

1488
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,359
so that's an example of things that need

1489
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:44,880
to be improved but you need a constant

1490
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,160
flow of the right information in the

1491
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,140
right format and it's not just a

1492
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,819
one-time thing when you get on a dive

1493
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:53,520
boat they always reiterate you're going

1494
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,260
in the water here's what you need to

1495
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,579
know now

1496
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,800
here's what you need to do safety stop

1497
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,900
you know you need to do this you need

1498
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,400
and even in the water they're telling

1499
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,020
you to do a safety stop

1500
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,020
so it's embedded as people are doing

1501
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,579
things and that's really what we need to

1502
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,800
be doing embedding awareness and

1503
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,619
practices as we're doing it not just in

1504
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,260
be aware because there's evil hackers

1505
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,599
out there because people are too afraid

1506
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,760
of the hackers and they're making

1507
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,800
mistakes that cost you more than the

1508
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,900
hackers ever will and he was talking

1509
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,240
about my Knights and Dragons I told them

1510
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,280
everybody's afraid about the big

1511
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,200
horrible dragons when they should be

1512
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,599
afraid of the rats and cockroaches with

1513
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,579
the fleas that cause the Bubonic plague

1514
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:38,099
the Middle Ages were never ruined by

1515
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,740
dragons they were ruined by rats and we

1516
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,119
need to make sure we're taking care of

1517
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,640
the rats not the dragons anyway

1518
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,160
hopefully I I went way over I apologize

1519
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,400
to the next thing

1520
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,520
thank you
