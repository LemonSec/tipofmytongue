1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
body if you ain't negate you're late

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,520
let's roll

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,160
it's broken

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,139
other button I'm hitting the green

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,059
button

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,179
oh there we go see somebody put me in

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,820
charge that was dangerous all right so a

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,980
bit about my background

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,160
heavy DOD heavy counter Intel

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,300
m-i-f-i-c-i ports of the US government

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,039
for God 18 years I feel old

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,660
um I've worked with almost every

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,520
intelligence agency that exists in the

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,160
U.S most that you know of someone that

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,579
you don't know exists a lot of fun there

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,899
um I've worked a lot with Intel

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,920
campaigns FBI or afosi I helped build

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,860
the March Center so that's where all the

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,300
intelligence agencies aggregate their

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,039
data for depending on

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,960
um to help Tear Down the Sky uh Sky 7

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,219
for

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,219
uh the NSA build up Fort Meade for the

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,140
new headquarters location I worked all

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,379
across nuclear systems I was a security

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,379
lead for Savannah Riverside nuclear

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,000
that's where the nuclear bombs are

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,860
manufactured for the U.S government as

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,380
well as most most of our European

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,580
partners

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,799
I've seen as a lot of feedback I can

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,720
hear me it's weird

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,320
um

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,840
I've done a lot of campaigns outside of

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
work had a lot of fun doing that with um

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,580
doing Nation state-based attacks against

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,320
foreign assets

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,299
um I've successfully smoked the Chinese

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,460
the Russians and the North Koreans so

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,520
far the Iranians are on my next list

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,100
that's going to be fun

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,439
um they've made some interesting

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
decisions lately so response incoming

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,600
and inbound

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,460
so we're talking about CNO CNO CNE

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,680
they're used interchangeably I don't

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
agree with it because one says

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
exploitation one says operations

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,100
realistically they're the same thing and

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,540
they all have three things in common

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,939
that are very very important what is

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,799
your purpose

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,500
what is your implementation and what is

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,920
your capability it doesn't matter if you

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,099
have the best hacking tools in existence

56
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,739
and the most badass infrastructure ever

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,500
if you have no purpose you are lost you

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
will never be able to get anywhere or do

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,140
anything

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,760
just like with any of the other

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,739
characteristics if you have the greatest

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,720
Mission since sliced bread and your

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Betty White is your boss

64
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,780
that's awesome

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
and you have the best exploits ever if

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,860
your infrastructure can't handle the

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,080
throughput and you can only pop one box

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
a day it doesn't matter you're dead in

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,819
the water

70
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,900
so

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,060
how do you declare purpose

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,500
you have to know what you're there for

73
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
whether it's for military purposes for

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,660
kinetic or non-kinetic reasons why am I

75
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,660
here what am I doing am I spying on

76
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,700
people am I creating a long-term

77
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
presence a short-term presence am I

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
looking for a particular individual or

79
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,940
asset what am I hunting for

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,519
or am I here to put Warheads on

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,680
foreheads and I'm looking for somebody

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,620
for a very simple itk model identify

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,120
Target

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,060
divide by zero

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,140
so

86
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,420
coming into weapon systems you have to

87
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,519
understand what your system is because

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,780
you have to know what you're building

89
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,340
what are you building it for what are

90
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,379
you targeting systems that are built for

91
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,780
something like a land-based material is

92
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,220
not the same as something built for

93
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,959
something on the water you're going to

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,640
have a very bad time if you build a

95
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,500
system to Target airplanes and you try

96
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,480
to use it against ships so there's a

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,040
classification model that I came up with

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,560
that I've been teaching I find it highly

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,340
effective cyber Land Air space and sea

100
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,080
the class system

101
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,239
just like with characters everyone's

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,159
good at something and they suck at

103
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,780
everything else

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,280
now

105
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
when you're looking at the

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,940
classification of a tool that gets you

107
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,400
into a very different model now you're

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,860
having to actually assess your tool what

109
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,200
can it do how well can it do it what is

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
it built for what stage is it at where

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,220
are we headed so you've got concept code

112
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,739
defunct code you've got nuisance code

113
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,900
malicious code and malicious destructive

114
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,939
non-lethal malicious destructive lethal

115
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,680
and then you've got a series of class

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,720
classifications of systems that are

117
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,940
tiered on the subsystem level before

118
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,339
them so you've got systems with multiple

119
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,680
fives and systems of multiple six with

120
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
large scale capabilities for

121
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
collaboration and Integrations so this

122
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,600
is when you're talking about weapon

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
systems that can talk from my government

124
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,199
to your government and we're

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
collectively targeting the annihilation

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,580
of a foreign entity or institution or

127
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,919
maybe even country and so we're talking

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,419
about the full-scale annihilation

129
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,040
because we may have a weapon system

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
that's capable of targeting all of your

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
Waste Management systems but we also

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,380
want to knock out your ability to

133
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,620
provide water and so the UK may have a

134
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,180
weapon system designed for wiping out

135
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,500
the water systems but they don't have

136
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,240
exploits for anything else

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,860
we combine those through collaborative

138
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,540
efforts collaborative coordinated

139
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,320
attacks and boom no more Moscow

140
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,720
so when you start looking at things like

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,820
these levels of systems you start

142
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,560
integrating these you're going to start

143
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,699
to find certain things certain

144
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,560
characteristics developments of certain

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
tools for profiling will have certain

146
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,400
characteristics certain capabilities

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,620
certain capacities certain methodologies

148
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,360
you can start to use those to do

149
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,919
everything from profile to code to

150
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,500
profiling to developer and so we'll skip

151
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
over these because they're relatively

152
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,900
basic

153
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,000
and we'll talk about those later but

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,100
realistically the effort that you want

155
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,500
to capture from that is that each one of

156
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,960
them up to level six and seven

157
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,520
you're going to relatively see either

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,979
within your standard commercial space

159
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,419
or you're going to see within a very

160
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,580
limited space of professional operators

161
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,740
typically up to three and four and maybe

162
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,600
even some cases five so you start to see

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,880
more dangerous tools that can be

164
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,800
extremely dangerous if leveraged with

165
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,860
the right people I and I liken it to you

166
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,660
know Anakin with the lightsaber you give

167
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,100
a rookie a lightsaber you have a really

168
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,259
cool lighter you give Anakin a

169
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,000
lightsaber you've got the world's

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,740
greatest abortion clinic so

171
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,940
run it with you may

172
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,440
so when you start talking about

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
implementations you start talking about

174
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,520
constructs start talking about

175
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,199
constructs you have to understand what

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,419
you have in play what is the design what

177
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,580
is the data what is the outcome that you

178
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,620
want how are you developing it how are

179
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,120
you building it how are you managing

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,979
that team you have a team you're

181
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,600
building something incredibly elaborate

182
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,340
either that or you're working with

183
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,380
someone psychotic like me that's done a

184
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,580
crazy career and has worked on

185
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,380
everything so you want to understand

186
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,479
what you're looking at you have to

187
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,979
understand how you're looking at it

188
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,940
Network systems data in that order

189
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,800
because it doesn't matter if you have

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,380
the best systems and the best data if it

191
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,780
can't communicate it fails

192
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,759
so you have to have the best systems

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
because the systems can't aggregate that

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
data properly store that data properly

195
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,860
and structure that data properly you're

196
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,240
not going to be able to access your data

197
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
effectively that's why the order exists

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,639
you have internal data you have external

199
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,680
data and then you have the data

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,940
structure itself this point here

201
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,979
extremely important for your data you

202
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,199
have to manage your data and manage it

203
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,600
well if you don't structure your data

204
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,419
you're in for a ship because you're

205
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,220
going to pull your data and you've got

206
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,780
gobbledygook and you're going to get

207
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,120
back unknown or unexpected or

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
undiscernable data results and then

209
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,139
you're going to have to modify all the

210
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,419
stages thereafter

211
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,699
just to deal with the mistake you made

212
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,259
the stage before

213
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,060
architect it well

214
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,500
then it will be structured well

215
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,039
therefore it can be analyzed well and

216
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,080
stored well within libraries so that it

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,780
may be indexed and mapped effectively so

218
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,460
that you can then tie it into the next

219
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,160
core component which is development now

220
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,259
that I have my infrastructure now that I

221
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,180
have my Enterprise my networks are in

222
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,479
place my systems are in place my data is

223
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,419
designed well it is well structured It

224
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,479
is Well stored It is Well understood and

225
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,759
it is well mapped so then I can build

226
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,680
custom systems to interface with that

227
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,300
starting with the back end

228
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
your back end will interface with your

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,160
data structure which runs off the back

230
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,599
plane of your design

231
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,479
and then with that then you can build

232
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,120
your UI most people say well we want to

233
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,220
build the user experience first

234
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,660
no

235
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,479
most users are idiots

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
what you want is a UI that will give

237
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,539
them a structure to look at

238
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,399
and inside of that structure you can

239
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,820
place a nav bar a sidebar a foot bar you

240
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,979
can put data fields a b c and d and then

241
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,339
the user can test that and then you can

242
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,820
get into tdd and user feedback based

243
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,620
development through ux

244
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,540
because then you have something that

245
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,560
works

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,360
and then they can easily say well the

247
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
data structure is great I love the way

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,440
that it's mapped out I like the current

249
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,920
systems but the UI component for this

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,500
space I don't like put that over here

251
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,779
okay cool shift that down here that's a

252
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,600
modification for CSS JavaScript SAS not

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,399
a big deal minor changes rapid

254
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,820
development rapid deployment speed of

255
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,160
operations CNO is about speed of

256
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
operations if I have to spend 15 days on

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,980
the damn Network looking for things to

258
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,440
deal with a small issue for a minor UI

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,940
component it's going to take me forever

260
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,500
to get you the tool that you want versus

261
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,880
giving you something and getting

262
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
immediate direct feedback and driving

263
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,800
that immediately forward so we're not

264
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
going to spend too much time on those

265
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
but we will spend a lot of time on this

266
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,380
those were design questions we just

267
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,959
covered this is how you want to start to

268
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,580
map out something

269
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,580
this is known as the level one DFD data

270
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,860
flow diagram this is how things will

271
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,680
communicate with one another

272
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,820
documentation is typically the most

273
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,800
ignored and abused thing in an

274
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,540
Enterprise

275
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,399
oftentimes neglected to catastrophic

276
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,100
results you need to understand what

277
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,420
you're touching

278
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,339
when you start talking cyber weapons and

279
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,320
CNL operations you're not playing with

280
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,839
something like a Red Canary anymore

281
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,940
you're not playing with a toy you're

282
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,620
playing with something capable of wiping

283
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,880
out a country

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
you need to understand what you're

285
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,399
putting your hands on and what you're

286
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,140
putting your hands around so

287
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,839
understanding that with dfds they go

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,700
from level one to level four

289
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,519
and each DFD diagram has a particular

290
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,160
purpose this one is level one it shows

291
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,380
you how everything connects at a very

292
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,000
top level basis it goes from the

293
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,339
framework to the postgres system to the

294
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,800
async process to a predefined function

295
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,480
typically through a micro service to a

296
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,860
back-end systems call that it can

297
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,140
communicate to the back end systems of

298
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,700
various other containers to communicate

299
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,800
with other tool systems that can

300
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,660
interface pull data back in and inject

301
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,880
that into other processes so that you

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,860
could do something like an adversarial

303
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,740
query from your UI to trigger an API

304
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,720
request to launch an attack

305
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,399
but you can do that as a collaborative

306
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,920
effort as a team of individuals you can

307
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,140
also do our bake bath our back based

308
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,079
implementations so it's we'll say this

309
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,360
cool dude up here has the ability to say

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,620
you know what

311
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,839
I'm going to allow that call

312
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,120
but then she says well I'm in compliance

313
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,339
and I don't think you should nuke the UK

314
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,200
because Turtles

315
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,040
well he has the gun but she's got the

316
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,180
ammo

317
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,160
if you can't Lock and Load

318
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
you've got a good control system

319
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,500
you always want a separation of Duties

320
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,380
unless you just absolutely trust the

321
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,600
people you're operating with or you're

322
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,860
operating in a private sector

323
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,019
environment and you're a very small team

324
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,920
there for very good reasons now

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,440
when you're looking at the external Wan

326
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,140
infrastructure you start to look at how

327
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,120
do you flow the traffic itself this is

328
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
where the network component comes in

329
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,339
most mistakes are made here

330
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,200
where they'll have the forward proxy

331
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,260
that routes to internal traffic that

332
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,240
routes to the Enterprise infrastructure

333
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,700
they fail to implement this stage here

334
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,279
it's a critical stage and reasoning why

335
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,240
is

336
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,980
well what if I don't want a sister

337
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,260
agency to have direct access to my

338
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,060
forward proxy information what if I

339
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,800
don't want them to know

340
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,279
how I'm being accessed for my CNO CNE

341
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,200
operations what if I have a vendor

342
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,940
partner and I don't want them to know

343
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,640
what if I have my data feeding back from

344
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,399
all of my C2 systems if I have an edge

345
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,000
proxy versus my forward proxy direct I

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
can send it to my Edge proxy and at any

347
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,620
time I believe it's compromised I just

348
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,480
cut it off

349
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,399
nothing gets compromised I just cut it

350
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,440
off and I still have my forward proxy

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
which I can change at any time which

352
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
protects my reverse proxy and everything

353
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,639
else that way I can avoid a full

354
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,100
system's compromise and all kinds of

355
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,620
other cascading failures because of that

356
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,200
then we get into the UI

357
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,240
how do we make her pretty well you can't

358
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,579
just slap lipstick on her uis don't work

359
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,480
that way

360
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,820
you've got core functionality

361
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,920
core functionality is based on your

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,820
purpose

363
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,060
what does it do what is it supposed to

364
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,000
do what is it supposed to do well then

365
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,040
based on that you will immediately know

366
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,279
should I make it a web application

367
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,920
or on a standard mobile application

368
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,019
should I make it for Android or iOS well

369
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know who do I trust more I

370
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,079
definitely wouldn't say these people

371
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,820
because they actively monitor your

372
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,740
device you want to see an O operation on

373
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,560
a mobile device iOS you watch your damn

374
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
mind

375
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,019
you're gonna do anything put on an

376
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,700
Android personally I'd say Blackberry

377
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,040
but nobody uses that

378
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,079
then on the website

379
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,700
you're almost always going to be

380
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,440
Services based can anybody tell me why

381
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,839
no takers

382
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,399
Cabots

383
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,019
It's gotta be somebody take a guess

384
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,279
why would you always run Services only

385
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,240
Services based

386
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,839
wow

387
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,700
you want to run Services based

388
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,980
specifically because of the fact that

389
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,779
when you're looking at large-scale

390
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,180
operations you need large scale

391
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,920
throughput

392
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,899
you can have large-scale throughput of

393
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,700
services on monolithic applications

394
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,160
however if all your services are on one

395
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,260
monolithic application you're going to

396
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,180
experience a failure

397
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,980
what happens if they compromise that one

398
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,360
service they've compromised everything

399
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,300
the entire thing is popped if they pop

400
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,339
one internal service you could chop off

401
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,560
that arm everything else is still

402
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,180
contained

403
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,579
you can have various services

404
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,820
I can run a service that's external to

405
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,160
my proxy I can have that as a data

406
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,320
access service to where I have a sister

407
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,600
agency who I do want to share data with

408
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,660
I can run that service as an aggregate

409
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,660
service of all of my data operations but

410
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,639
not give them access to any of my ttps

411
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,339
or even my internal Enterprise I can

412
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,820
share data without sharing technology

413
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,500
very important

414
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,120
then you can get into the services

415
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
question do we want to run monolithic or

416
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,560
micro

417
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,420
and that comes through throughput and

418
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,980
that's based on purpose

419
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,380
if I build a tool That's Heavy for Recon

420
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,800
well what am I reconing am I reconing a

421
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,480
very small group

422
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,060
of extremely radical individuals well

423
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,800
then I don't need a huge system I'm not

424
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,899
going to need a Kafka level scalable

425
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,480
operation I could do that just fine with

426
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,399
some postgres databases

427
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,800
but what if I want to monitor multiple

428
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
groups of unknown sizes we start talking

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
in intelligence agencies microservices

430
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,500
is a good way to go now micro Services

431
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,839
could mean a lot of things

432
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,339
that could mean running literally

433
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,440
Services code that could just be a

434
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,480
python function floating in Oblivion on

435
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,560
what they say is a serverless

436
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,720
environment which is a Linux box that's

437
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,160
been stripped now

438
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
it's never such thing as a purely

439
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,399
serverless environment

440
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,260
you could have a micro service which is

441
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,139
a container that runs a very particular

442
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,060
flask application that does a very

443
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,920
particular thing

444
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,320
you could have that running a full-in a

445
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,680
full on API back-end or that API service

446
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,199
communicates to another application or

447
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,779
another service or web services or

448
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,779
portals period you can have an entire

449
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,459
different UI that interacts with the

450
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,600
data completely differently you can

451
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,120
segregate the data on not only the user

452
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,699
permissions level but the actual data

453
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,519
model itself you can take the data and

454
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,759
carve that data up and say based on this

455
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,519
data point for this data model I want

456
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,740
that model for these fields available to

457
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,959
these operators but not the other data

458
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,759
fields to the other operators you're

459
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,339
segregating your data itself and not

460
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,040
just the access it's not just oh well

461
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm admin I have access to everything no

462
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,360
you're an admin the only thing you can

463
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
see is infrastructure

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,300
now when we get past the campaigns we

465
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,760
start talking about the Intel everything

466
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,240
about CNO and CNE is driven by Intel

467
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,220
that gets down to what is hacking versus

468
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,220
what is intelligence because operations

469
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,799
and operationally they are not the same

470
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,140
they do not function the same the skill

471
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,240
sets are not the same if you've ever met

472
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,980
somebody in a hacking conference which

473
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,740
is 100 of the population somebody that's

474
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,260
a red team operator is not on par with

475
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,820
somebody who does social engineering

476
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,740
professionally they have a very

477
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,720
different tool set tool Suite he's like

478
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,559
I do

479
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,240
there's a handful of people that are

480
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,799
incredibly good Joe gray is one of them

481
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
he scares the out of me and he's an

482
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,220
awesome dude but there are very few and

483
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,620
far between that I've met that have the

484
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,720
skill sets to cross both lanes and when

485
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,900
they do they're typically monsters now

486
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,360
when you're looking at Intel you have to

487
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,919
be able to segregate that Intel because

488
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,980
Intel is not created equal open source

489
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,360
data feeds are not the same as having

490
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
direct access to Department of Labor in

491
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,299
the DMV

492
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,000
but then you've also got other systems

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,480
where we're looking at things for data

494
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,160
when you're looking at the data and the

495
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,140
data structure itself you're looking at

496
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,880
data versus data flow

497
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
because it's one thing if I can make a

498
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,299
database call

499
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,160
it's another thing if I'm receiving

500
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
real-time data from another agency

501
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,919
another institution an RSS feed

502
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,380
something on an XML format that's being

503
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,360
fed to me or through a Json through a

504
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,539
rest API or some other API portal call

505
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,299
like Fast API when I'm receiving data

506
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,299
feeds in real time I have to respond to

507
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,539
those differently because breakage is

508
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,440
very real your network can go down for a

509
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,100
second

510
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,220
and that one second

511
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,200
is measured in milliseconds to computer

512
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,539
system is measured in nanoseconds to a

513
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,620
CPU

514
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,780
and so that one

515
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,299
could be megabytes of data

516
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,480
megabytes of data just

517
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,620
gone

518
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,960
megabytes doesn't sound like a lot Until

519
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,179
you realize that text-based data streams

520
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,220
are in the bytes level

521
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,380
you could have lost an entire

522
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,980
operational capacity an entire new OU

523
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,059
that you completely missed

524
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,520
one blip that's it

525
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,620
and so you have to respond differently

526
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,020
that's when you start to design

527
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,120
differently very important that's when

528
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,039
you start to look at how do I cache my

529
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,340
incoming data how did I certify that my

530
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,160
data feed coming in is accurate am I

531
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,620
replicating across data structures from

532
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,140
point A to point B does their database

533
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,720
match my database how do we sync up

534
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,480
databases without giving you access to

535
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,580
all the database how do I do a partial

536
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,400
table comparison how do I compare just

537
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,160
my one table to your one table without

538
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,260
comparing the entire database that's

539
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,700
when you start to get into the really

540
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,039
intricate levels of data management and

541
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,780
data operations which becomes very

542
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,240
important very quickly

543
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,179
now when you start looking at

544
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,220
intelligence you have to understand the

545
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,200
types of intelligence because some

546
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
intelligence is very passive it doesn't

547
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,220
require a response

548
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,240
some intelligence is hyper active which

549
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,460
means if you don't make a split second

550
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,140
decision somebody will die

551
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,720
they are going to die

552
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,220
when you start talking about that in

553
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,600
type intelligence you're looking at

554
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,860
counterintelligence Military

555
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,679
Intelligence typically most Austin data

556
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,900
doesn't carry that cost burden

557
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,000
so you have to have a weighted approach

558
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,700
to your intelligence analysis what do

559
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,080
you give priority

560
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,600
how do you give priority

561
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,880
well that's based on purpose

562
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,340
if your purpose is counterintelligence

563
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,559
you may have to make the Split Second

564
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,020
decision of let an asset die

565
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,660
that's a hard call to make

566
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,520
can you imagine that sitting in a

567
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,260
command Operation Center of some kind

568
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,120
sitting somewhere halfway across God's

569
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,220
green earth no you can flip a switch in

570
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,720
a second and turn somebody into space

571
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,360
dust but in doing so you compromise a

572
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,140
mission

573
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
so you have to let a known asset die so

574
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,840
that you can maintain access and

575
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
persistence these are some of the hard

576
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,100
challenges that you have to make

577
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,140
that you have to address that you have

578
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,580
to overcome

579
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,080
when you're operating at these

580
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,120
capacities you're not playing games

581
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,340
anymore now you're dealing in human

582
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,960
lives

583
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,500
now the multiple types of business

584
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,480
intelligence well that crosses an

585
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,640
interesting threshold because we are at

586
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,260
a time space

587
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,480
of going kinetic

588
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,059
and we are going to rock the boat

589
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,679
some people have already been approved

590
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,140
for hacking back some countries some

591
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,820
organizations some states are still

592
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,500
considering it

593
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,200
but very quickly this type of

594
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,600
intelligence is going to be applying

595
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,580
these types of intelligence

596
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,679
to then be able to respond to other

597
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,659
forms of intelligence at least from in

598
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,280
the U.S perspective some other countries

599
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,020
are considering it some other countries

600
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,900
are not it really depends on what you're

601
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,539
doing where you're at what is the

602
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,280
business prerogative what is the

603
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,260
business assessment what is the risk

604
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,640
tolerance

605
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,220
and more importantly what is the cost

606
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,020
if you're looking to accept the

607
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,539
liability for instance of erasing a

608
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,460
human life

609
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,200
if your company takes an average of a

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
three to eight percent hit to its stock

611
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,620
market price

612
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,919
and you're worth 400 billion dollars

613
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,720
cost of a human life is going to be

614
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,100
between somewhere between 2 and 10

615
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,299
million

616
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,700
shake that tree all day

617
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,220
but then what's the legal ramifications

618
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,340
well it depends what country are they in

619
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,720
do you think the U.S is ever going to

620
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,860
honor a Russian murder extradition order

621
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,179
these are questions we have to ask

622
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,400
they're ethical questions they're legal

623
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,419
questions moral questions

624
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,919
they're hard questions to answer we

625
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,120
don't know it depends on the

626
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,140
institutions

627
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,940
these are some of the examples

628
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,520
some of these things look like

629
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,340
trending data pieces for business

630
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,740
we could be seeing Google

631
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,080
hacks of 15 year old in England

632
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,539
five years from now 10 years from now

633
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,480
landscape is evolving quickly

634
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
we're seeing certain data sets in cyber

635
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
is another good one here this one I

636
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,419
pulled directly off of one of the

637
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,460
companies that I'm actively analyzing

638
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,799
this belongs to Wagner

639
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,960
or PMC Wagner group

640
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
and this is one of their recruitment ads

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,740
which is paying a tanker about thirty

642
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,100
two hundred dollars a month

643
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,280
if you want to go to war in Ukraine

644
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,720
good luck with that Abrams

645
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,700
and then these are some hybrids this is

646
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
what it looks like when you have an

647
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
integration of hybrid data this was when

648
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,580
the Ukrainian I.T Army hacked the PMC

649
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,080
Wagner site

650
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,380
when you integrate things like humanet

651
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,400
analyzing the users

652
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,640
military int an operational capacity to

653
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,260
knock out the recruiting capabilities

654
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,140
and then encounter intelligence because

655
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,059
they are actively analyzing one of their

656
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,880
major competitors PMC Wagner who is

657
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,919
actively campaigning to recruit staff

658
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,380
members to go directly to war in the

659
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,659
Ukraine and then they took the bodies of

660
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,400
all the dead Russians that they'd killed

661
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
recently

662
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,460
hack their website

663
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,679
and put some new graphics on there

664
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,260
help with recruiting

665
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,080
now when you start talking Intel Intel

666
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,299
is very important you have to understand

667
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,580
your data you have to master your data

668
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,559
you need to understand what is its value

669
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,100
I created a model for that you've got

670
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,260
four very big components

671
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,260
my personal favorites Fidelity how much

672
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,919
do you trust the data it doesn't matter

673
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,200
where it came from if you don't trust it

674
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,539
you've got to have integrity which means

675
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,700
it's always going to be on point even if

676
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,380
it's information you don't want to hear

677
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,260
nobody wants to hear about layoffs but

678
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,419
if you tell people about layoffs 100 of

679
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,580
the time when you say there's either

680
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,960
going to be layoffs they're not going to

681
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,179
be layoffs you're far more likely to

682
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,280
trust the source especially if they've

683
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,380
always told you the truth that's why

684
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,320
Google is facing a crisis currently

685
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,780
quality if the data isn't structured

686
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,779
well if the information isn't structured

687
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,900
well if it leaves out key details key

688
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,200
components the data is low quality which

689
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,059
means it's not viable it's not

690
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,159
trustworthy because it's not viable not

691
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,020
because you don't trust the source you

692
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,779
can't act on data that's incomplete at

693
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,240
least not to a good event not to a good

694
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
outcome and then age

695
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,679
if I tell you there was a warship in the

696
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,380
Cayman Islands in 1942

697
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,900
fantastic no one gives a

698
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,039
if I tell you there's six Russian

699
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,559
carriers outside right now well holy

700
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,260
 let's go take some pictures

701
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,679
like that's that's age hell yeah let's

702
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,820
go see

703
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,860
maybe with those smokes

704
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,500
now data structure versus data modeling

705
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,140
they are not the same

706
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,820
this is a mistake that a lot of people

707
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,039
make and it personally frustrates the

708
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,659
 out of me as somebody who has to

709
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,919
clean up the mess

710
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,539
and the reason why I say that is when

711
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,760
you come up behind somebody who has

712
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,039
structured the data versus someone who

713
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,980
has modeled the data the data is modeled

714
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,740
if it is modeled incorrectly it doesn't

715
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,340
matter if my data systems are built well

716
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,700
because your data is not formed properly

717
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,679
if I use an elastic system something

718
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,120
that everybody in here is probably

719
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,059
relatively familiar with or Oracle or

720
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,880
postgres a database and I have data

721
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,400
tables and you're injecting user data

722
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,039
into my cars table

723
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,720
it's going to be really interesting when

724
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,760
I pull up Mr Toyota

725
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,980
because his last name is Prius

726
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,559
that's going to be a fun time

727
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,080
now when you start looking at these

728
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,220
things

729
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,380
and you start analyzing the data a data

730
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,940
structure you start looking at data keys

731
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,400
and key value pairs you start to assess

732
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,140
these things and you're looking at them

733
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,539
from a perspective of what kind of data

734
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,919
fields all right well now we're getting

735
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,820
into the data structure itself structure

736
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,440
model

737
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,020
this is how I have modeled it my site

738
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,179
key value pair Fidelity score Integrity

739
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,520
score quality score age score who did it

740
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,919
come from country of origin user base

741
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,520
Target system acquisition period what is

742
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,740
the target value you can use a Target

743
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,200
value sector inside of your scoring

744
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,779
model just for analyzing where you want

745
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,460
to put military assets and you can

746
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,039
search that by an M or a B can I do

747
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,020
millions of dollars in damage or

748
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,820
billions of dollars in damage because if

749
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,460
I can crash one Reaper drone into one of

750
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,799
your battleships and sync it I'm going

751
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,480
to spend about four hundred thousand

752
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,340
dollars to wipe out something that costs

753
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,100
about four billion dollars I will spend

754
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,440
that dollar redo every day

755
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,419
because that is some serious collateral

756
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,419
damage now when you start looking at

757
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,340
event sourcings you're starting to look

758
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,260
at the separation here you've got

759
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,120
artifact Source you've got Event Source

760
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,159
you've got artifact event you can have

761
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
any number of columns you can have any

762
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,260
number of indexes you can have any

763
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,120
number of data structures for those

764
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,640
including tdma based you can have them

765
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,159
in CDMA based because you can segregate

766
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,720
them by the cell phones that you're

767
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,940
hacking and each one can have a

768
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,940
significant identifier such as a uuid

769
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,480
or an inei number or a phone number and

770
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,100
you're aggregating all that data based

771
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,320
on the individual indicator and then you

772
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,820
can filter for those you can have

773
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,940
aggregated structured layers of tier of

774
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,520
tiers of data set to where you can

775
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,559
aggregate something as simple as to who

776
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,200
has the same applications installed on

777
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,400
the same phones inside my elastic system

778
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,679
on this side of the country in the past

779
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,760
46 to 92 hours you can get that specific

780
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,980
because if they're operating leveraging

781
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,960
the same Communications devices and the

782
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,179
same communication mediums and they're

783
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,559
operating on the same three or four

784
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,080
applications and you can't capture all

785
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,820
the information for them and identify

786
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,100
them as a Warfighter you can identify

787
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,720
them based on the applications that

788
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,580
they're sharing in common because if

789
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,080
they're sharing three and four and five

790
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,360
and six applications those applications

791
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,860
are doing the same characteristical

792
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,960
behaviors they're doing DNS callouts

793
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,760
they're doing IP Communications they're

794
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
leveraging specific protocols all of

795
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,200
these things you can track as metrics

796
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,880
and you can correlate those inside of a

797
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,039
system any kind of system many types of

798
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,960
systems my personal favorite is Apache

799
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,120
spark it is a beautiful system for

800
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,860
aggregating all of your wonderful data

801
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,740
and to one place and querying it now

802
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,440
once you have the data these two pieces

803
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,620
get screwed up a lot you normalize

804
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,140
first

805
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,120
you transform

806
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,559
second

807
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,020
you have to have a format it doesn't

808
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,120
matter if it's 100 columns a thousand

809
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,399
columns a million columns and they could

810
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,440
all be blank

811
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,480
except for the ones that you need

812
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,520
and then you can transform that into

813
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
that normalized data structure and

814
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
aggregate the data quickly and it looks

815
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,279
something like this it could come in as

816
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,679
Godly peace is completely missing

817
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,080
and then you could say well

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,899
I don't have two and three

819
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,940
or four and five

820
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,000
or one and two but I do have one two

821
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,279
three four and five collectively

822
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,260
and I can aggregate all that data into a

823
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,700
data store

824
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,980
capture that data aggregate that data

825
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,200
after I've normalized the data and then

826
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,500
transform that data into one useful

827
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,480
user-friendly viable data set where I

828
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,700
can track down and Trace down

829
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,740
all the way down to any of those data

830
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,120
columns to any of the devices to any of

831
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,559
the locations at any point in time any

832
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,179
period of time with any application at

833
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,559
any given point

834
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,919
I can hunt you down and put

835
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,020
Warheads

836
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,980
to foreheads

837
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,399
now

838
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,580
data is not created equal it's weighted

839
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,380
how do you weight it well we've already

840
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,520
had a pretty good conversation about

841
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,460
that what is the purpose the objective

842
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,320
how is it relevant

843
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
what is this waiting score

844
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,880
that aggregate number allows you to say

845
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,559
well

846
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,539
if I've got three different phone calls

847
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,580
four different phone calls 5 000

848
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,440
different phone calls like in natural

849
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,380
disasters for instance I've Got 5 000

850
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,760
different phone calls about people being

851
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,399
hurt well how did I weight that score

852
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,799
well which ones were oh I've got a cut

853
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,880
to half my arm is missing well what are

854
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,620
they gonna be the goals of are we

855
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,059
looking for Disaster Recovery

856
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,100
preservation of life

857
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,080
are we looking at

858
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,059
a mixture are we looking at causing the

859
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,980
missing arms

860
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,779
if we've got fifteen thousand phone

861
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,460
calls and fifteen thousand tips and

862
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,659
there's a person that we're looking for

863
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,760
well

864
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,320
how do we weight that well who did it

865
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,600
come from Fidelity score if it came from

866
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,899
you know New York Police Department I'm

867
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,940
far more likely to trust that

868
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,179
versus Granny Smith

869
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,320
nothing there's anything wrong with

870
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,640
Granny

871
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,620
but we need to wait that somehow because

872
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,299
we're more likely to capture somebody if

873
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,179
we do now this is a waiting score model

874
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,860
that I use you can create up anyone that

875
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,299
you want

876
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,399
it works well for me

877
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,840
higher the score

878
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
more likely it is to be accurate

879
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,520
lower the score

880
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,840
more likely you are to be turned into

881
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,299
space dust

882
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,059
now that's how a data flow diagram can

883
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,760
look in any average environment

884
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,559
it works very well

885
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,080
data sources data byproducts data direct

886
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,080
into your Storage storage into

887
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,360
processing processing into dedupe you

888
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,860
want to de-duplicate the data get rid of

889
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,020
it because data is expensive to store it

890
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,480
also impacts performance except reject

891
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,980
kick into the next pipelines whatever

892
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,440
those pipelines are now we're talking

893
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,299
about capabilities of personnel we're

894
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,399
getting into the personnel

895
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,919
infrastructure technology what can it do

896
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,380
how can it do it how fast can it push

897
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,720
the data if you can't push data well

898
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,240
you're screwed especially in real-time

899
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,399
operations you have to be able to move

900
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,919
and move fast

901
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,140
Personnel they have to have skill sets

902
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
you have to understand your team this is

903
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,059
the most important thing from the talk

904
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,919
if you take nothing else

905
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,620
go back to your workspace build a skill

906
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,380
matrices find out what everybody is what

907
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,380
everybody does and most importantly what

908
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,240
everybody enjoys doing and what they're

909
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,340
good at you'd be amazed to find out the

910
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,360
skill sets that you're completely

911
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,799
overlooking because you've never built a

912
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,779
skill matrices you don't know what

913
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,820
you're capable of if you don't know what

914
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,260
you're capable of because you never

915
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,419
asked that's the number one mistake I

916
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,460
found in most teams now vendor

917
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,200
capabilities and capacities you're

918
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,519
married to the vendor

919
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,679
that comes with its own problems your

920
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,019
data structure data modeling did ETL you

921
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,060
have to be able to move data and then

922
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,918
capabilities comes your technology if

923
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,780
you can't push capabilities you can buy

924
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,060
them and I promise you you can buy them

925
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,639
there's a list now you have to

926
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,260
understand your personnel and what level

927
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,940
they're at they're not just oh I do

928
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,619
python code it's oh well I've written

929
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,480
one python script one time 10 years ago

930
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,000
versus I'm a core contributor to the

931
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,940
Django and python project specifically

932
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,699
for backend systems with uis with my

933
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,060
Django Geo project I actively contribute

934
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,219
it could be argued I'm in the four to

935
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,260
five area people who have only ever

936
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,060
written one python script ever probably

937
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,679
in the tier one

938
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,460
now it answers questions how analysts

939
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,199
they're juniors they're rookies they

940
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,239
can't do much they can click a button so

941
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,739
the monkey is in the sock they hit the

942
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,239
button They smash the button they make

943
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,679
the thing go bling

944
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,160
now Engineers this is where most people

945
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,800
live once you've hit senior engineer

946
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,619
level you can do most engineering things

947
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,660
you can do most things manage most

948
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,880
systems operate most capabilities on a

949
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,460
localized basis with minimal

950
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,800
interaction minimal assistance minimal

951
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,480
capabilities minimal vendors

952
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,660
you can do the what you can't do the

953
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,540
where you don't know why it's there you

954
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,400
just know that you run the blue coat you

955
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,380
know that it moves the traffic you don't

956
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,240
know why you put the blue coat there to

957
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,920
modify the behavior of the applications

958
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,380
that are five Stacks down because you

959
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,760
just run the blue coat you don't ask

960
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,960
questions

961
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,480
most people never see tier three truly

962
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,180
because they don't understand the where

963
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,220
they manage a lot of people at architect

964
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,599
level you have to understand a lot of

965
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,680
things about the environment and

966
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,020
ecosystem most people never reach that

967
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,359
now developer you're starting to answer

968
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,040
the why question at a more intimate

969
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,560
level you know not only where it's at

970
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,960
and why it's there but you understand

971
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,260
the why it was made why it was put in

972
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,140
there why do we rate limit inside of the

973
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,619
proxy why did we choose this dll Library

974
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,740
versus that dll Library

975
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,940
but then you get to the expert level

976
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,859
and you can say we did it in this way

977
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:18,420
specifically because of these

978
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,820
performance metrics we didn't just say

979
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,680
we're going to go with that dll versus

980
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,500
this dll it's when you plug this bad boy

981
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,560
into an arm 64 processor with 28 cores

982
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,040
128 gigs of RAM 15 nvme drives running

983
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,460
in a RAID 0 across a parallel processing

984
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,579
system across a postgres XL database for

985
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,500
distributed Data Systems you're going to

986
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,920
see a 0.67215 metric Improvement per

987
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,160
transaction speed of 4K or less on a 26

988
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,500
to 128 megabyte transaction you're going

989
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,540
to see a 1.7 millisecond Improvement

990
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,339
those are the levels of details that

991
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,800
they can give you and why the in what

992
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,700
way very important now last but not

993
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,820
least you have to have the skills to pay

994
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,119
the bills networking systems automations

995
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,280
you have to have these if you can't do

996
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,160
them you are up creek without a

997
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,280
paddle there are holes in the boat and

998
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,320
the Bears on the coastline and it is

999
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
dinner time you are done though you will

1000
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,099
not make it

1001
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,740
probability of success is negative

1002
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
but nice to haves you've built custom

1003
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,820
tools you've got red teaming experience

1004
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,920
penetration testing and operator they

1005
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,720
are not the same separate the mindset

1006
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,760
they do not behave the same they do not

1007
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,740
test the same they do not play the same

1008
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,440
and I definitely don't play by the scene

1009
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,660
architecting experience especially for

1010
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,760
socks Intel operations and Enterprises

1011
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,040
if you have played with systems you

1012
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,359
understand why they work where they work

1013
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,180
that helps you to do this you can build

1014
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,700
tools because you understand what to

1015
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,619
Target how to Target it and what way to

1016
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,780
Target it what makes it functional what

1017
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,540
makes it good and what makes it bad

1018
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,240
because you can beat up the bad all day

1019
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,520
now the highly desired skill sets are

1020
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,839
going to make you the three four five

1021
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,900
hundred thousand dollars are these

1022
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,240
C C plus plus assembly especially with

1023
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,579
Intel based processors AMD is Shifting

1024
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,020
in because they're now a better price

1025
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,540
point especially for cloud malware

1026
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,460
development of any kind especially

1027
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,859
anything that's polymorphic multipartate

1028
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,040
especially if you can combine the two

1029
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,720
obfuscation services for detection

1030
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,720
avoidance huge huge money right there

1031
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
you can do Advanced apt training for

1032
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,680
companies and organizations like Forge

1033
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,540
and other institutions like that with

1034
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,520
the NSA and other foreign assets like

1035
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,940
8200 74455 if you can take that one

1036
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,839
raise your hand

1037
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,420
and then you can do things like exploit

1038
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,220
development this is where a lot of

1039
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,380
exploit developers specialize I

1040
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,720
personally don't agree with that mindset

1041
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,540
but some people do mobile is a hot

1042
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,619
Market

1043
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,859
especially for nation state iOS

1044
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,260
is huge in the states

1045
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,839
Android is God mode on a global level

1046
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,820
because there are far more Androids than

1047
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,160
Apples I'm just saying

1048
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,280
are your base are belong to me desktop

1049
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,079
has gone the way of the Wayward side

1050
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,060
it's coming back because people are

1051
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,220
moving towards leveraging computers the

1052
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,560
size of phones and a lot of desktop

1053
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,060
applications are making their way over

1054
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,320
to phones because they now have the

1055
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,440
computational capacities to handle it

1056
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,180
application pin testing that's a hit or

1057
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,619
miss it depends on what you're targeting

1058
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,900
something's big something small browsers

1059
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,119
are huge and then last but not least for

1060
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,440
nation states if they want to cause

1061
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,200
large-scale destruction ICS scada

1062
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,119
systems power generation Waste

1063
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,160
Management water purification water

1064
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,680
processing anything that does Logistics

1065
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,640
and transport all those things are huge

1066
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,040
now build versus Buy

1067
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,260
do you build it do you buy it it depends

1068
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,540
what do you want to do

1069
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,859
um that's a pretty easy question it's

1070
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,020
got the pros and it's cons and then

1071
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,500
you've got your vendors who to shop with

1072
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,180
you can get pretty much anything you

1073
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,900
want from these guys for a price

1074
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,560
any questions

1075
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,480
where do you hide oh I'm sorry sir

1076
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,579
people have tried that we found them in

1077
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,720
the middle of the desert with a million

1078
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,820
dollars in cash and a whole 20 plus feet

1079
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,040
down you can't hide that's not an option

1080
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,960
what we got come on people got questions

1081
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,940
how do you build it how do you hack an

1082
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,440
iPhone can someone break into this

1083
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,640
Facebook account come on there's

1084
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,930
something

1085
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,160
[Laughter]

1086
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,960
how do you hack an iPhone you typically

1087
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,640
Target one of the services running on it

1088
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,040
anything that can be routed through any

1089
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,200
of the core Services of the provider are

1090
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,540
typically a good Target browser

1091
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,660
um SMS Services email authentication a

1092
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,040
lot of the iCloud services are

1093
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,359
targetable

1094
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,859
um you're gonna have more visibility for

1095
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:09,420
development on Android than you are on

1096
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,160
iOS because they obviously get a lot of

1097
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,180
things for the protection of the

1098
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,640
operating system but you can also get

1099
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,500
Services allow you to replicate an iOS

1100
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,420
device that bypasses those protections

1101
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,520
from certain vendors which null and

1102
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,560
voids that protection but you've got to

1103
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,940
have some serious cash to buy that

1104
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,839
um

1105
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:30,540
what's up sorry

1106
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,079
um you mentioned uh using using skilled

1107
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,520
Matrix matrices for teams yes now my

1108
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,099
question is have you ever had or been in

1109
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,380
a circumstance where that process might

1110
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,960
have maybe opened a can of worms or

1111
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,640
backfired in some negative oh yeah

1112
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,320
people lie all the time

1113
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,200
people not only line consider a like a

1114
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,619
case where uh you know someone's role is

1115
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,960
this but they're very good at XYZ and

1116
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
you say what do you want to do this oh

1117
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,560
that's fantastic transform over yeah

1118
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,480
don't waste human capital your people

1119
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,560
are your best you're in the greatest

1120
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,520
asset

1121
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,619
if they've got skill sets and they're in

1122
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,540
a specific role I love these these are

1123
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,040
my favorite where I'll get a staff

1124
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,420
member like we'll say her because she

1125
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,160
smiles a lot and she's like I want to

1126
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,680
learn fibers and she's like an analyst

1127
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,960
or something over in like billing well

1128
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,300
fantastic I know that this guy's got all

1129
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,339
the slice bread on that skill set what

1130
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,900
I'll do is I'll take her pair her up

1131
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,359
with him and Bam I've got a partnered

1132
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,300
pairing program for mental Protege and

1133
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,099
I'll take her skill sets and level them

1134
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,900
up to his because he may have an

1135
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,880
interest in management he may want his

1136
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,220
job and we say okay well he's going to

1137
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,200
retire in five minutes because he looks

1138
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,060
exhausted and then he's going to take

1139
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,280
his job and she's already ready to go I

1140
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,599
don't have to hire out and pay a

1141
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,359
staffing agency 38 I actually just saved

1142
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,800
a shitload of money by doing it and

1143
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,440
that's the easiest cost justification

1144
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,180
since free money

1145
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,160
so you just try to balance out the pen

1146
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,319
yeah absolutely train them up you always

1147
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,060
want to train up the worst mistake you

1148
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,220
could ever make not just in CNO and CNN

1149
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,540
and I wish people would really take this

1150
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,220
seriously for a moment just level with

1151
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,000
me

1152
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,060
if you don't train your people you will

1153
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,920
train your people anyways what you'll

1154
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,119
train them in is you'll train them to

1155
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,800
leave

1156
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,300
and that will be the most expensive

1157
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,980
mistake you'll make because all the

1158
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,079
money you've poured into them all the

1159
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,440
way up to that point 86 a year two years

1160
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,480
three years five years

1161
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,800
gone

1162
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,780
if you don't invest in your people

1163
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,700
somebody else will

1164
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,980
so you can pay the bill now

1165
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,079
or you can pay the bill later

1166
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,079
but you will pay period

1167
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,520
there is no escaping that that is the

1168
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,380
reality of our industry especially with

1169
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,180
the current situation current climate

1170
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,460
current hyper availability of rolls

1171
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,980
hyper roll compression all these

1172
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,839
characteristics have stacked up to the

1173
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,839
ultimate disaster in terms of Staffing

1174
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,359
you are facing an apocalypse if you

1175
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,400
don't train your people you will be

1176
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,020
annihilated as a team and I've seen it

1177
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,220
happen time and time and time again

1178
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,440
where people have lost five six seven

1179
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,440
eight members 50 60 70 80 percent of

1180
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,240
their teams because they refuse to

1181
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
invest in them and trains something as

1182
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,859
as cost effective as udemy which I

1183
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,140
personally use is a phenomenal training

1184
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,720
Source you're talking ten dollars

1185
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,260
thirty dollars sometimes sometimes a

1186
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,760
hundred dollars

1187
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,940
for incredible content 140 150 200 hours

1188
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,700
of training content with study guides

1189
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,460
practice guides sample code

1190
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,920
you can't beat it so make the minor

1191
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,660
adjustment now or make a major

1192
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,960
adjustment later

1193
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,180
what you got

1194
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,000
oh was that too serial did I hit a nerve

1195
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,260
my bad

1196
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,680
[Laughter]

1197
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,940
Management's like oh I don't like

1198
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,359
this guy anymore

1199
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,359
no other questions oh you gotta hand up

1200
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,619
you're raising a hand just speak up

1201
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,720
oh we got a mic oh okay we're we're

1202
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,240
playing past the mic uh really what a

1203
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,380
weird question

1204
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,339
um

1205
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,560
pretty abstract but could you see it

1206
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,599
came out in any way should perform a

1207
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,099
situation where we might become a Target

1208
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,200
oh absolutely you have some of the

1209
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,380
biggest banks in the world here they

1210
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,260
have a small footprint but they have a

1211
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,460
huge presence

1212
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,020
if you understand what I'm saying

1213
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,700
pretty much that yeah very big Target

1214
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,980
and then that's that's actively one of

1215
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,859
the reasons why I came here is it's in

1216
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,480
the cayman's best interest to build a

1217
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,740
very big stick

1218
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,300
because if you have a very big scary

1219
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,560
stick

1220
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,599
people will be a lot less likely to play

1221
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,560
 around and find out

1222
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,960
I'll around and find out

1223
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,680
oh absolutely hang on so

1224
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,380
you've got zero

1225
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,480
and the more you around the more

1226
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,900
you find out that's relative

1227
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,420
to capability and it Peaks after you

1228
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,160
start putting Warheads on foreheads it

1229
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,500
kind of levels out like you can't do

1230
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,240
anything more kinetic than deleting

1231
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,500
somebody's house

1232
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,599
now whether you actually hit the house

1233
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,160
while they're in it is completely

1234
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,420
irrelevant

1235
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,740
and all you do is send a little love

1236
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,520
note

1237
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,920
be like

1238
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,780
seized by the Cayman government

1239
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,700
sends a very clear message

1240
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,500
you hit our bank that's that's you

1241
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,119
subtly saying we know you hit our bank

1242
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,339
we know it was you we used human

1243
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,380
intelligence cross-collaborated with

1244
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,700
foreign governments confirmed that it

1245
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,859
was you and then we turned your house

1246
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,380
into space dust

1247
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,359
do you think that person's very likely

1248
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,460
to hit another bank here again

1249
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,480
you hit enough people and their houses

1250
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,000
or the cars or maybe you just send them

1251
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,859
one of those uh they got that mail order

1252
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,700
service where it's a big box of

1253
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,260
it's just like the worst smell ever you

1254
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,240
just send them one of those because that

1255
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,980
says we know where you're at we know

1256
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,500
you're there we know it was you

1257
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,720
so here's a little love note about all

1258
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,280
your you can have your

1259
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,260
back

1260
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,700
that will put the fear of God in

1261
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,099
somebody and I guarantee you that will

1262
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,319
change a lot of little singing canaries

1263
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,000
and they'll sing a very different tune

1264
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,440
they might become white hats a lot

1265
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,599
faster than they expected

1266
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,440
I'm just saying

1267
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,099
does that help with the around and

1268
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,760
find out try it

1269
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,680
organizers ask that we clear the room

1270
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,359
after this so

1271
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,800
um thank you very much I think you gave

1272
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,960
us a lot to think about in a very

1273
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,560
interesting
