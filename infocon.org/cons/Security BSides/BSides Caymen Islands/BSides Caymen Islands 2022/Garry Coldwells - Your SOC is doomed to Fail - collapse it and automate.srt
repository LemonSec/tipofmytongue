applaud at the end

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
um so as it says up there um and you may

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,159
not know we existed um i'm from the

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
cyber crime and digital forensic unit

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,799
which is part of the rcips

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,799
um

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
so i'm going to go through a little bit

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,360
of

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
my experience prior to coming here

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
just to give you an idea who i am and

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
what i've done

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,960
so i was a police officer for 30 years

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,600
mostly in major crime investigations

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,399
murders rapes etc

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,720
um i actually set up in my force the

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
first high-tech crime unit

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
um i did want to advertise um for people

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
by saying are you a geek please come and

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,840
see me

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,040
but hr wouldn't let me do that

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
after i left the place i

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
became involved in teaching police

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
officers to

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
do open source intelligence

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
which is basically um one of the things

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,879
that um ashley spoke about yesterday

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,000
about

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
using facebook um

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
twitter

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
and other materials to find out about

49
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,879
people because um people just give away

50
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
so much online and then

51
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,480
sometimes it makes our jobs a little bit

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
easier

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
as part of that i was actually

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,840
at uc online which means i was an

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
undercover officer online specifically

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
in irc chat rooms

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
um i don't know if anybody

58
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
is aware of the uk tv program called

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
catherine tate but i named myself lauren

60
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
and modeled myself on lauren

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
and had to learn the language of a 14

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
year old girl because that's what i was

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,239
um

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,560
my kids used to get fed up with me put

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,599
my hand up and saying whatever

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
and putting laws at the end of all my

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
texts

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
but it was an interesting experience

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
after that i was recruited by the

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
national crime agency into the national

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
cyber crime unit

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,080
i was involved in a number of

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
investigations and having been sat in

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,920
the audience for a couple of days it's

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,239
actually um

76
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,000
quite amusing really because most of the

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
investigations that people were talking

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
about i was actively involved in

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
um

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
i think the first speaker mentioned

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
wannacry

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
and when the splash screen came on

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
to the the main screen for the

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
ransomware

85
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
i think my eyes started twitching again

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
for one of the longest weekends of my

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
entire

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,159
my entire life um

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
i was actually

90
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,519
um

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
i was also involved in um

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
mirai botnet um a gentleman called

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
daniel k who used the mirai botnet to

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
target lloyd's bank and barclays bank

95
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
currently residing at hm prison due to

96
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,359
my well my my team's effort

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
but most of my experience is based in

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,358
working within the ncsc at gchq and and

99
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,199
the uk london headquarters um

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
so for four years i was there basically

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
involved in investigating the most

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
serious cyber attacks in the uk

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
um

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
i know i actually mentioned yesterday

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
the the case we were involved in here

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,040
about um

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
the the pedophile

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,639
and um

109
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
the

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
i gave expert um evidence that he hadn't

111
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
been hacked or

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
had rdp access into his system

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
um the barrister

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
said to me after gone through my

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
qualifications he went uh qualifications

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
are all very well and good but what

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
experience have you got which allowed me

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
to say i've just spent the last four

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,600
years doing this

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
and we then had a little poker game

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
where i was basically going i i see your

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
20 minutes on google and i raise you my

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
experience of doing this

124
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
um i was actually during the wannacry

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
investigation i was actually in the room

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,560
um sat next to the nsa

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
sharpie

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
um when we discovered that it was

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
eternal blue which if you don't know is

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
an nsa exploit

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
um and he just said one word

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,320
which was

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
um

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
i was also actually involved in the one

135
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
that we spoke about this morning uh the

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
previous speaker the coinbase um he

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
didn't mention an email that they that

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,919
they clicked on

139
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
that email actually emanated in the uk

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
so we were involved in trying it was a

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
compromised account obviously so we're

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
involved in trying to bottom out

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
um where the compromised account had

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
come from

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
um and now i'm here so i went from a

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,240
building with 5 000 people um to an

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
office of four

148
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
so what brought me here

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,479
um well i would like to say the sunshine

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,080
but it was actually the the very

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
affordable rent

152
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
um the reasonable cost of living

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
and the incredible standards of driving

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
i've seen on the island

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
i'll go back to the first one which was

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
sunshine actually

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
so why am i doing this presentation

158
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,199
um i want to get the messaging out as

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,960
far as possible

160
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,440
[Music]

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
the the cyber crime team itself is quite

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
new it's only really been formed since

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
i've been on the island

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
um and i'm not sure how many people knew

165
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
we existed so um i'd met with

166
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
a couple of people who'd introduced

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
mickey james

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
i had to meet with james and he went

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
look the best place for you to get your

170
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,759
messaging out is here so that's why i'm

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,440
here at the moment

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
um

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
um the rcips have a three-year strategic

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,840
plan part of that strategic plan

175
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,880
is

176
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
and this is generic to all forms of

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,400
policing but it's to understand the

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
threat

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
secure the cayman islands

180
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,800
and ensure safer communities now i'm

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
charged with driving that as far as

182
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
cybercrime is concerned as well

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
but

184
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
that's going to be impossible

185
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,080
without you

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
help and that's really why i'm here

187
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
is to tell you what we're trying to do

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
and say to you let's get involved let's

189
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
work together

190
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
um because hopefully you've seen i do

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
bring a lot of experience i doubt

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
there's anybody else in the island

193
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,080
who's studied apts um hostile state

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
actors um significant cyber crime groups

195
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
um one of the investigations i was

196
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,250
heavily involved in was the

197
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,560
[Music]

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
maximum jacobets known as

199
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
i can't even say it aqua

200
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
um and the evil core group if you don't

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
know who they are

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,639
google them

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
because if nothing else they'll tell you

204
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
cyber crime pays

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
google maxim yakabet's wedding and

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
you've seen the most lavish wedding i've

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,758
ever seen in my life

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,520
what we're trying to do is to make

209
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
cayman islands a hostile

210
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
environment for criminals i

211
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
can't do that on my own need to do it

212
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
with you guys

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
we do try and take a four-p

214
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
approach the cyber crime

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,799
which is prepare

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
mitigate the impact of serious cyber

217
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,839
attack

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,919
exercising protect

219
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
strengthen protection against serious

220
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
cyber attack

221
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
prevent

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
prevent people becoming involved in

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
cyber crime that actually gets less and

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,160
less the more cybercrime moves abroad

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
and lastly pursue

226
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
which is just detect disrupt and

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,839
prosecute

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
the prosecutor is always going to be

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
difficult because a lot of the cyber

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
criminals are not based anywhere in the

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
jurisdiction that is user-friendly

232
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,360
however we can disrupt

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
um i put out some publicity the other

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
day

235
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,560
about

236
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,080
a fishing campaign that purported to

237
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
come from sydney

238
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
in actual fact if you clicked on that

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
link

240
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
that site had already been blocked by

241
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
the government systems

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
so it shows you disruption can work

243
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
and that's what i can do

244
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,720
so my mantra from my experience

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
complacency is the enemy of cyber

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,839
security

247
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
and i mean complacency as and it will

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
never happen to me we're okay we've got

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
everything right

250
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
nobody can do anything to us

251
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
and because my experience from the uk is

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
that's never really true

253
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
secure by design sounds lovely

254
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
but it's just design

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
application maintenance i think cat

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,959
spoke about it yesterday as well

257
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
you can only design

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,640
if you know what the weaponization is

259
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,560
and that's one of the issues i've got

260
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
here at the moment

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,040
oh

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
you only know how much you need a system

263
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
when you don't have it

264
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
um the attacks i've dealt with took down

265
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
entire networks um and people just

266
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
didn't realize what they were and i'll

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
talk more about those in a moment yeah i

268
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
know it's expensive

269
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,000
but what happens

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
so this was an investigation involved in

271
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
europeans europeans were the biggest

272
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
supplier of of forensics that's wet

273
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
forensics in the uk

274
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,519
and they were taken out by ryuk

275
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,120
um i love when it says it's highly

276
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
sophisticated as ryuk is not highly

277
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
sophisticated but it completely and

278
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,120
utterly

279
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
shut down their network

280
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
and one of the reasons that the

281
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
complacency is the enemy of cyber

282
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
security

283
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
is ncsc had given

284
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
europeans a warning about six months

285
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
before this happened saying that we

286
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
detected trick bought in the system

287
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
if you don't know what trigbot is it's a

288
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
thing that sits in your network

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
basically steals all your data steals

290
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
all your passwords in plain text and it

291
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,079
had been there for six months and they

292
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
did nothing about it then they got hit

293
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
by ryok

294
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,880
as it says there they um

295
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,440
they paid a ransom fee nobody they've

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
never revealed publicly what the ransom

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,600
fee is i can't because i learned it

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,040
within the confines of a secure

299
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,399
environment

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,680
um but it was a lot of money

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
uh hankny council another one of my

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
investigations cost them 10 million that

303
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,519
that was the upfront cost what that

304
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
hidden cost this was a council that

305
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
couldn't pay their employees couldn't

306
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
provide school meals

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
because they're no system

308
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
red car another council cost them 10.4

309
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
million

310
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
but i don't think we should really

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
should look at this is just costs

312
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
because yeah it's gonna cost you but

313
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,399
there's a human cost as well

314
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
um

315
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
moscow was a number of colleges that

316
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
were hit with ransomware attacks and

317
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
basically on gcs

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
sorry gcse results day

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,320
they couldn't tell the pupils what the

320
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
results were

321
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
because the systems were down

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
they were linked to um

323
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
another school through the same id

324
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
provider and

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,920
the admin for both ads had the same

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,399
password

327
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,839
[Music]

328
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,800
and it's

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
it's the length of time it takes to get

330
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
back up and running um i think we

331
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
probably all know that the one of the

332
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
first thing riot does

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
is it looks for everything that could

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
have an extension that means it's a

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,160
backup and if it can see it it encrypts

336
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,120
it

337
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
so if you've got completely offline

338
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
backups and you can restore excellent

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
kudos

340
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
um my experience tells me because i've

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
seen companies do it is it takes a long

342
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
time

343
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
the europeans won was more than a year

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
before they were back back up and

345
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,839
running

346
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
and they paid the ransom

347
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
um yeah there is reputational damage you

348
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,040
just need to ask sophos about that one

349
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,760
so what do assets want to do um because

350
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
my time is coming to an end

351
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
we want to work with industry in the

352
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,200
wider community to understand the threat

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
um i have head through the grapevine in

354
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
the back door but i can't actually

355
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,000
bottom this out but i'm pretty sure that

356
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
last year there was a phishing attack on

357
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,199
a major entity on ireland that tried to

358
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,399
exploit the log full shell

359
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,680
so anybody here think that would have

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,120
been good information to have been

361
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
shared with you

362
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,199
so um i want to work more about

363
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,639
understanding the threat as i said

364
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,160
before you only understand the

365
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
weaponization you almost understand the

366
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,880
threat if you understand weaponization

367
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
um i have muted this to james and others

368
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,160
um we are in a very vulnerable position

369
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
being on an island

370
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
and um and i think it's ashley said

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
yesterday

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,279
the um

373
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
if you're a big company and you have a

374
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
major ransomware attack you're probably

375
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,120
going to have to call in a cir company

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
simply because they've got the expertise

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,079
to

378
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,480
fully restore your networks and more

379
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
importantly get rid of persistence

380
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
but what would happen is that would take

381
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
a bit of time if there was a major

382
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,079
attack on some of the critical match um

383
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,440
critical infrastructure on cayman

384
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
who would respond so mute the idea about

385
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
people coming together to form a

386
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
community uh cyber security incident

387
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,880
response team

388
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
to try to do that stuff um so i'm

389
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,320
putting that one out there

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
um and carries more reporting of

391
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,079
incidents

392
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
um not a lot comes into us i'll be

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
honest um

394
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
investigated one ransomware attack last

395
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,040
year

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
but the rest of it we pick up through

397
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,199
social media ourselves or people phoning

398
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,440
stuff in i would encourage more people

399
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
to get involved with us

400
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
together we can beat crime i'm not that

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
naive particularly cyber crime i doubt

402
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,040
that but we can target hard and as and

403
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
as part of that can we work together

404
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
let's not be complacent

405
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
um and that's my email address please

406
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
write it down and contact me if you've

407
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
got any questions any desires i'm really

408
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
keen to move this on i think james is as

409
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
well um and i know rj's keen to get

410
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
involved as well

411
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
let's do what we can to protect the

412
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
cayman islands from significant attacks

413
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
because hopefully i've shown how

414
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,199
devastating they can be

415
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
i wanted to have a question if you email

fail

446
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,080

thank you very much and um

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760

inaugural b-sides for cayman and uh i'm

450
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
thrilled to be part of this so thank you

451
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
for having me um

452
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,640
i don't intend to be completely

453
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
contentious but obviously that you know

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the title suggests that there's

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
some contention you know potential there

456
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
um i understood from the front desk

457
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
there's at least three sock providers

458
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
that are uh

459
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
part of the conversation uh in the two

460
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,200
days so you know if the tomatoes are

461
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
ready to be thrown have at it it's all

462
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
good uh so again thank you let's uh

463
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
let's dive into this

464
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
so what is the mission of a sock

465
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,880
you know fairly straightforward three

466
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
three key things that we're looking for

467
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
in the in the stock infrastructures

468
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,799
threat monitoring threat hunting

469
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
incident response

470
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
right essentially the ability to disrupt

471
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
the operations of those that want to

472
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
target and attack our infrastructures

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,919
get after iap

474
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,760
get off to our personnel

475
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
exploit our weaknesses right so

476
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
we need to have an understanding of that

477
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,039
entire picture

478
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
do constant review know with our own and

479
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,360
third party and external review get our

480
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,600
auditors involved get feedback from them

481
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
and all parties that we do business with

482
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
so that we can have a holistic picture

483
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
john's call out for the cert type

484
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
approach a community type approach i

485
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
think is a very good one um i think it's

486
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
tremendously useful um particularly an

487
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
island community like this where it is a

488
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
smaller community

489
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,440
a tight niche of of potential players

490
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
under the 70 000 population where we

491
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
have common interest common stake in in

492
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,600
working together on that i think that's

493
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
amazing john thanks for that um

494
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,679
really useful

495
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
so let's have a look

496
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
tactics techniques and procedures right

497
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
you adam spoke this morning extensively

498
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
about um you know the the techniques

499
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
approach um on the deception side

500
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,520
amazing talk very good conversational

501
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,400
just referencing specifically to that

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
output the most recent output

503
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
for the mida ingenuity attack

504
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,799
evaluations

505
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,160
a really good paper that was was

506
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,559
produced a study that was produced where

507
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
essentially there was you know 25 i

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
think

509
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
between 25 and 30 vendors took part and

510
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
essentially an open study where it's

511
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
like literally we roll up

512
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
we give you the technology and good or

513
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
bad they're going to examine it they're

514
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
going to put it through some stricture

515
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
they're going to mark it against an

516
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
evaluation structure and obviously a

517
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
framework and from that will become an

518
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,720
output

519
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
and that output is published so

520
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,799
if you're

521
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
subgrade or you miss key points or you

522
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
have things in there that are maybe out

523
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
of scope or haven't been covered well

524
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
bad luck for you if you have good

525
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
technologies well implemented well

526
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
structured understandable and

527
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
translatable into something that people

528
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
can use in a very effective way great

529
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,000
for you and so if you read these reports

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,039
this one specifically is really

531
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,400
interesting

532
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
you'll see one of the things that's kind

533
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
of cool is across the commentary from

534
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
the vendors that were in play all the

535
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
cfo ctos et cetera that made comment

536
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,679
about the report finding

537
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,760
we're largely positive the nuance in

538
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
there is you know how effusive the the

539
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
positivity was

540
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
um there's a handful in there that did

541
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
incredibly well as expected

542
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,039
ourselves and our peers it is what it is

543
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,320
you know great players great

544
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
technologies good solutions good

545
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
thinking behind what can be done um

546
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
specifically around uh xdr and the stock

547
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,559
component and integration of those two

548
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,600
things

549
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
but what the what their study

550
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
specifically looked at

551
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
was they did modeling on wizard spider

552
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,240
and sand the sand worm teams um you know

553
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,679
so the not picture thing obviously was

554
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,679
sandwin was was well known for that

555
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,679
wizard spider with uh with ransomware

556
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,120
attacks across a number of different

557
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,320
infrastructures in finance and

558
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
healthcare i'm based out of toronto

559
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
i've dealt with health care and

560
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
government exclusively for the last 18

561
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
months just as a focus piece and i can

562
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
tell you that healthcare

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,200
in general is uh it's undefended

564
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
is under-resourced and is is essentially

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,679
struggling in at least in our canadian

566
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
context we had a number of instances

567
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
where that particularly was that bit

568
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
people and cost them some money

569
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,960
and for the public infrastructure

570
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,240
obviously that's a problem for for

571
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,640
everybody

572
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,960
the focus of that specific testing

573
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
was tactics techniques and procedures to

574
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
abuse

575
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
encrypted data for impact

576
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
um

577
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,039
i just the reason why i wanted to really

578
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,320
circle around this is you know one of

579
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
the things you have is a stock is a

580
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
volume of information that you have to

581
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
deal with you have to disseminate

582
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
breakouts of what's important how things

583
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
are going to structure through your

584
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
approach through your teams through your

585
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
technologies to get you to in a decision

586
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
point

587
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,799
um if you're not encrypting stuff if

588
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
encryption is part of you know that

589
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,840
things are too scary too complicated to

590
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,520
uh you know too abstract

591
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
you're missing a great deal um just a

592
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,559
quick reference point i think the

593
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
current numbering on on google is about

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
96 of everything they see in touch is

595
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,520
encrypted at least in tls format so just

596
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,159
decision and conversation around there

597
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,600
if your security practice excludes

598
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
decrypting things um

599
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
you've got you've got a serious

600
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
conversation we need to have you know

601
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
please take me aside and let's chat some

602
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
more about that

603
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,919
so what is in the scope of our control

604
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,600
people process and technologies as we

605
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,039
all understand these are foundational

606
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,159
things that we've spoken about for a

607
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,600
long long time

608
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,480
um

609
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,039
and it's the balance of

610
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,000
budgeting capability

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,559
currency of you know of these three

612
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,799
points that we can sort of pull together

613
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,559
to give us a sense of where we're at

614
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,720
what our state is and what we can do

615
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,600
right so you have great people

616
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,640
you know

617
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
maybe okay technology um

618
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
you'll get frustration it will amount

619
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
and in the stock conversation

620
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,679
specifically the traditional thing

621
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,039
always was

622
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,080
you know we're going to build a

623
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
framework we're going to have teams

624
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
that'll you know we'll do sort of level

625
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
one folks that have you know a certain

626
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,200
intermediate level understanding of

627
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
what's going on in the environments

628
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
they'll do some low-level alert stuff

629
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,039
they'll process things through and hand

630
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,159
it off to the

631
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
smarter teams who will then do a

632
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
next-level analysis

633
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
maybe dig into what they're actually

634
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,159
seeing and hand that off to the actual

635
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,600
threat hunters who will get into the

636
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,960
meat of things

637
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,559
a common three-tier sock was what people

638
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,120
structured around and that is one of the

639
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
aspects that is doomed to fail

640
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
it is impossible

641
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
to maintain a staffed infrastructure

642
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,520
given current conditions given you know

643
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
what's what people want to do and how

644
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,279
they want to maintain interest and earn

645
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
well right there was a conversation

646
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
probably about five years ago where this

647
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
was a hot space to be

648
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
you know the sock was really catching on

649
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,360
more and more infrastructure was built

650
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,919
around these by healthcare finance etc

651
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,200
where they had these unique teams

652
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,279
government sorry not to forget them

653
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,400
where they would have these unique teams

654
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,520
they'd pull together to do these

655
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
response pieces understand what was

656
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,440
going on and do all these things you

657
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,799
know in very split explicit terms

658
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,919
the single greatest thing that was a

659
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,279
problem for that wasn't the technology

660
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,360
wasn't the process it was just

661
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,279
maintaining people in seats right

662
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
because we had a muppet we had a

663
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
a mapping and a modeling that said like

664
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
for us to be fully staffed and fully

665
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
functional we're going to handle this

666
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
many events by these many people and

667
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
this should be our expected outcome and

668
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
we haven't you know it's into events per

669
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
hour that these people would be able to

670
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
process and that gives us a sense of

671
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,039
where we're going to go

672
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,120
and as things the velocity of attack the

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
velocity of problems increased

674
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
um largely the people on the front lines

675
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
of that got disaffected looked at what

676
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
they were doing and said now i've got to

677
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,679
be doing something different

678
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,120
right this is a job i'm just

679
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
getting swamped to this stuff i can

680
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
never keep up there's no reward in this

681
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
for me i'm doing nothing that's really

682
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
important and you know

683
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
will be interesting to me in my career

684
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,600
i'm literally just wading through slop

685
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
and they started packing that in

686
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
real problem then because that means

687
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
that we had technologists that weren't

688
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
going to generate to the second level

689
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
which was a you know one of the more

690
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
important levels of that stock modeling

691
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,559
of the time

692
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,159
um and even more importantly they were

693
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,840
then in time generate and go up to the

694
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,679
third level being those tier three

695
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,679
analysts you know the super the guys in

696
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,440
the birkenstocks and the running shorts

697
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,120
and the you know the running vest in the

698
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
back of the room doing the really cool

699
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,120
and sexy stuff um those guys and ladies

700
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
would would you know be a piece apart

701
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,279
and they'd be the smallest sort of piece

702
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
of the pyramid in terms of knowledge and

703
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
experience

704
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
i will reference here

705
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
very specifically and i'm going to put

706
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,520
this up in terms of like this graphic

707
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
because i love the graphic for a couple

708
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,840
of reasons number one

709
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
you'll see the eight ftes

710
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,360
um if we had this conversation five

711
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
years ago we were that entity right the

712
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,120
largest commercial threat database in

713
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
the world we see and and process uh you

714
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,120
know attacks at a volume that is just

715
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,159
unheard of

716
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,360
um

717
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
and to deal with that we had a 42-person

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
sock

719
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
so we were the model of we have to have

720
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
these three layers we have to have these

721
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
three managers we have to have this you

722
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
know this process that covers 24 hours

723
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,039
and is global and all the rest of this

724
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,880
because that's was the understanding of

725
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
the times and that's what you did

726
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,200
there was a sea change in that where

727
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
people started recognizing we just we

728
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,799
couldn't keep bums in seats

729
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,640
process you know we just we couldn't

730
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,000
keep up with the process that we needed

731
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
in terms of just adjustment for what we

732
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
were going to be dealing with as the

733
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
volume and the breadth of what we had to

734
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
deal with increased

735
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
right so the technology was the piece

736
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
that had to change

737
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,159
and the technology drove a lot of change

738
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
in a very practical way

739
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,120
um

740
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
the biggest thing that was required to

741
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,679
make that change courage

742
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,120
right it was to to say like we don't

743
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
need 42 people we need to winnow this

744
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,039
down we need to let the technology take

745
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,880
care of a lot of this for us

746
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
trust in automation trust in a playbook

747
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
structure trusting in an approach that

748
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,400
has a decision tree

749
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,159
that we can maintain and grow and

750
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,960
actually have time to work on and adjust

751
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
validate it you know through our peers

752
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
validate it through third party our

753
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,159
auditors can validate you know what

754
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,000
we're thinking of and doing within here

755
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,080
and make sure that this is all sound and

756
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,559
so this is the picture today

757
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,760
right and you see that number there it's

758
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
1.5 trillion events this is 1.5 trillion

759
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,279
events

760
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,600
we face every 90 days

761
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
right i'll give you just a referencing

762
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,360
we block automatically about 224 billion

763
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
unique events a day

764
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,600
that don't even feature on this number

765
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
now we're producing about 4.3 million

766
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
global signatures that are available to

767
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
everybody within our infrastructures at

768
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
a moment's notice as soon as we see

769
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,559
something new and we can codify it

770
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,919
it's it's structured and sent out

771
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,279
through the different technologies about

772
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
4.3 million of those a day that are

773
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,640
completely unique

774
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,440
you know and uh and valuable

775
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
so pretty cool numbers pretty shocking

776
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
in their own way what's really really

777
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
cool is if we had this conversation

778
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
three years ago that number was 800

779
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,000
million

780
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
right so three years

781
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,960
36 months 800 million to 1.5 trillion

782
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
and it's just going up every quarter

783
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,520
this number adjusts it's crazy what you

784
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,039
see there

785
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,240
about a billion of those are just

786
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,159
automatically taken off the top these

787
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,320
are such silly like high level stuff

788
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,159
that it's it's really just like scraped

789
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,240
off and not even dealt with

790
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,919
down to the next level monitoring and

791
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,679
alerting so the breakout here which

792
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,799
would have been

793
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,200
kind of your level one previously

794
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
digging through the chaff of all those

795
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
alerts all the stuff that's out there

796
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
right having that process through a

797
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,240
decision tree in an automated way that

798
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
would allow you to take

799
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,120
from there 1.49 trillion events

800
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,039
crystallize that down to about 6 000

801
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,320
alerts that you would actually care

802
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
about

803
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,799
i mean the numbers are just ridiculous

804
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,279
right 1.5 down to 6 000 events or six

805
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
other things that you would care about

806
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
um you think about that in terms of like

807
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
the fte thing eight ft's 6000 events 90

808
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,440
days

809
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,120
still quite heavy but you know we're at

810
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
least we're in the range now we might

811
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,679
actually be able to do something and

812
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,440
still have a sip of water and you know

813
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,679
get back on the drum beat of rowing the

814
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,520
ore and pulling the galley forward right

815
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
so what you need from there is further

816
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
analysis further investigation and again

817
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
technology again playing the biggest

818
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
part within this

819
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,360
right getting the automation getting

820
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,559
your playbooks getting different

821
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,120
structures of playback and decision tree

822
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,240
so that you can see things that you've

823
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,159
had before you can recognize where

824
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,440
things might be awful we see something

825
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
that's new and interesting and have to

826
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,559
make an adjustment within there

827
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,159
right and every one of those eight ft's

828
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,600
essentially functioning as a tier three

829
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,880
at this point has to be able to be able

830
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,799
to do those things completely throughout

831
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,679
the whole cycle

832
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,360
i'll give you a little little nugget

833
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,480
about that that we don't publish but

834
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
it's kind of interesting

835
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,919
those fts are nine to five

836
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,240
we don't have a you know 24 hour sock we

837
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
don't have a global presence right we've

838
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,559
got those ftes one manager

839
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,480
nine to five operation

840
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,919
we have automated everything behind that

841
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,360
so that we have page of judy two of them

842
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,840
carrying the pagerank potentially

843
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
not a pager anymore but the pager is

844
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,600
sent at any given time to respond to

845
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
stuff that might come up at any moment

846
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,320
really really cool

847
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,880
getting down to that so 5200

848
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
automated

849
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,559
analysis and investigation functions

850
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
that go on there

851
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
and then from that crystallizing down to

852
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
800 manual investigations so the actual

853
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
cool work the stuff that people research

854
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,679
and and potentially write about and go

855
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,200
to their local b-sides or their local

856
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
universities and have conversations

857
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,279
about and share with with everybody else

858
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,120
talk to john and people like that you

859
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
know with a c-cert type of a

860
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
conversation share with the industry

861
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,159
peers that they they're aligned with

862
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,520
those are the sort of things we get into

863
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
like that's the career building

864
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,480
interesting things that everyone always

865
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,919
wanted to deal with by being a sock

866
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,039
analyst

867
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,240
right and so

868
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,919
it gets down to a crystallized function

869
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,200
that we can actually manage in terms of

870
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
time so people process technology in

871
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,760
function in perfect harmony gives us

872
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
that type of approach and the number at

873
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
the bottom the little gold thing down

874
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,240
there

875
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,919
this is a 10 quarter like 40 months

876
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,519
we've been having this discussion with

877
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,279
with industry

878
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,679
10 quarters no major incidents to date

879
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,120
and i'm actually going to talk about

880
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,279
part of sunburst and solarwinds as a

881
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,360
function of this just to give an example

882
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,240
of

883
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
how poorly things can go but you can

884
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
still be you can essentially still be

885
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,360
covered within that in terms of stock

886
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,840
infrastructure

887
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
so the enemies of the legacy sock and at

888
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,519
this point i'm just going to take a

889
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,880
little pause

890
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
and i'm just going to make the statement

891
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
the conversation i'm trying to have with

892
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
you is about numbers it's about people

893
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
process technology dealing with volume

894
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
in a way that you can actually handle

895
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
this is not despite the little

896
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
conversation upfront about

897
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,840
um you know the sock will fail this is

898
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
not a knock on socks as an approach this

899
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,120
is very much an underlining and

900
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
underscoring of how essential they are

901
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,279
to every single operation so no matter

902
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,720
how small you are no matter how big you

903
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,440
are

904
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,760
you do need sock type functionality

905
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,440
whether it's your own in-house or it is

906
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,559
a managed

907
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
security service that is applied and

908
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,559
driven by someone else audited and

909
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
verified by their third parties and

910
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,960
yours for functionality and efficacy

911
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
um it's very much we we're very much

912
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,799
saying like shock capability is

913
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,440
definitely what we need um

914
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
legacy sock too many low fidelity alerts

915
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,679
again that burnout factor of just i

916
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,200
can't i can't deal with this stuff it's

917
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,720
just driving me crazy

918
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,679
you know this is just rubbish

919
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
investigations are time consuming and

920
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,039
i've got to slide a little bit further

921
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,240
on that'll deal with some of this sort

922
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
of stuff

923
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,799
one of the things that was a challenge

924
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,720
initially in changing from traditional

925
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
sock down to a very lean automated type

926
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
approach is digging into these

927
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
investigations right seeing what was

928
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,840
time consuming see where we were bound

929
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,320
with things before in terms of having

930
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,360
conversations with different

931
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
stakeholders different groups third

932
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,000
parties you know police and national

933
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
security infrastructure people that

934
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
might be involved in these conversations

935
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
so in canada you know you're going to

936
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,399
have to go to cse and

937
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,919
thesis and explain what you're seeing

938
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,240
why it's relevant have they seen this is

939
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,919
there something that we can deal with

940
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,120
you know et cetera et cetera those

941
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
things always take forever

942
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
because everyone has to acknowledge

943
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,679
whether they're going to even talk to

944
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
you about the issue first

945
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,279
and from there acknowledge and decide

946
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,720
whether they want to engage with you on

947
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
it but there's a little nuance that's

948
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,399
very interesting but

949
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,480
anyway it is it is what it is

950
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,039
and then there's repetitive manual tasks

951
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,200
right that sort of stuff is just drives

952
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
everyone nuts and this is a function of

953
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
what we've done for 30 years in cyber

954
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,240
security functionally is those

955
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,519
repetitive things those things that you

956
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,200
know should be taken care of that you

957
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,039
still have to slog through you still

958
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,159
want them checked you still want them

959
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,519
logged you still want a record of them

960
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,360
somewhere but this is not a people thing

961
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,039
this is a technology thing now and you

962
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,640
should use it as such

963
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,919
so

964
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,840
in legacy socks

965
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
important threats are missed just a

966
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
volume thing

967
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
right target everyone remembers that

968
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,840
alert fires body recognizes the alert

969
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,240
calls it out hey there's an alert

970
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
the other side goes like file

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
and months later someone goes like well

972
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,760
hang on

973
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,679
something happened there nobody told us

974
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,960
about this and they're like oh actually

975
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,080
they did but oh well you know

976
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
not a great sort of approach

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,919
continuous firefighting mode again that

978
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,279
dreaded thing of like just continuously

979
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,799
being in that mode of never being able

980
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,800
to maintain never keeping up as the

981
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,639
volume increases as

982
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,960
you know the uh as the problems sort of

983
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,000
mount

984
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
you just you're on the back step more

985
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,639
and more and more and it just it just

986
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,000
drowns you

987
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,639
right 90 of analyst time spent

988
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,480
responding to alerts

989
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,679
again think of that pyramid you've got

990
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,440
to push that stuff aside

991
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,639
right if you're wasting people's time

992
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,760
doing that you're going to burn them out

993
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,719
they're going to leave you they'll go

994
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
into something else they'll be selling

995
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
real estate and please give me a shout

996
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,719
i'm looking to move to cayman

997
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,639
you know at some stage in the next year

998
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,839
if you're burnt out sock analysts and

999
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,960
you're selling real estate give us a

1000
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,079
shout let's go

1001
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,040
um

1002
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,879
large shock teams so trying to maintain

1003
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,879
that the volume you'd need for people to

1004
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
deal with the volume of issues of course

1005
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,839
and higher less turn high analyst

1006
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,159
turnover right the job sucks why would

1007
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
you do this

1008
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,480
and so

1009
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560
things to bear in mind

1010
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,040
let's talk about that example so fireeye

1011
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
called this sunburst

1012
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,079
in december of 2020 um

1013
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
really interesting timeline here and

1014
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,040
this there's a very nice little

1015
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,119
confusing narrative around this

1016
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,680
so if you looked at

1017
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,040
the response to

1018
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,119
solar storm was we called it unit 42 our

1019
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,400
research is called solar storm

1020
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,520
timeline is amazing because

1021
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,320
september of 2019 we saw an incident

1022
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,280
occur

1023
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
where there was a command and control

1024
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
call out from a device locked

1025
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
automatically blocked lockdown and a

1026
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,160
signature created in our structure right

1027
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
the automation doing its job as we would

1028
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,400
expect so great result

1029
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,839
further analysis we take that thing

1030
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
offline we look at it

1031
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
contact

1032
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,480
the folks over there and say like hey um

1033
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
something's going on here this is out of

1034
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,200
bounds

1035
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,599
it's definitely your process

1036
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,880
we'll work with you let's go on this

1037
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,960
thing and there you know unfortunately

1038
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
this does happen in industry

1039
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
you know you do the responsible

1040
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
disclosure you reach out to people you

1041
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
say like hey this is something you guys

1042
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,720
should think about here's a problem for

1043
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
us and they're like yeah we're kind of

1044
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
busy over here like we'll get back to

1045
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,960
you

1046
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,520
and so a month tricks by and in october

1047
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
then the conversation really starts to

1048
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,079
like

1049
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,839
hey so that thing you guys called out we

1050
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,800
told you to basically bugger off um

1051
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,920
let's have a talk about that and see

1052
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,760
what's actually going on and then in

1053
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
december

1054
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,720
firearm recognizes they've been

1055
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,200
compromised by their clients referencing

1056
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,599
okay shoot things are happening in here

1057
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,359
and they call it out and publicly

1058
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,000
publish the you know the sunburst paper

1059
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,839
so that's when you know industry and

1060
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,960
people really got whoa hang on

1061
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,720
iran servers are everywhere solarwinds

1062
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,079
is common

1063
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,240
you know the supply chain or this you

1064
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,839
know this trust

1065
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,880
chain that's been essentially

1066
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
established in there is a real problem

1067
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,680
for us

1068
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
and as an industry it was kind of a big

1069
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
wake up for a lot of people to you know

1070
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,800
to sort of reanalyze about how they how

1071
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
their trust structures work and so let's

1072
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
dig into that so sun versus a back door

1073
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
injected into a into a legitimate

1074
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,640
solarwinds orion plug-in

1075
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,040
right digitally signed by solarwinds so

1076
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
the guys that structured this the people

1077
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
that put this together were smart enough

1078
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,079
to put that in way and and basically

1079
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
subvert that trust so that it could

1080
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
potentially propagate

1081
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,880
unnoticed

1082
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,000
and the unnoticed part's really

1083
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
interesting because in front of congress

1084
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
in the us

1085
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
when

1086
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
the solar winds team had to go in there

1087
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
and please explain

1088
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
they put it down to an intern right was

1089
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
they'll blame the intern track

1090
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
um i'm really really happy to say that

1091
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
after that

1092
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
their ceo actually came out was you know

1093
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,079
you can google it publicly he came out

1094
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,760
and said yeah we should never have said

1095
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,440
that it was you know that that's not

1096
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
correct we're not that kind of company

1097
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520
we're not a blame the intern group

1098
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
um

1099
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
our their own internal sort of

1100
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
investigation suggests

1101
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
it was a two-year

1102
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,920
breach of theirs that have gone on

1103
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,599
right so timeline here is ridiculous

1104
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,680
like it's like with so sometime from

1105
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
2017 onwards

1106
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,119
this activity was infiltrated into very

1107
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,040
quietly very stealthily

1108
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
in play

1109
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
even with you know how this thing worked

1110
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
was was very clever so when we saw it in

1111
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
september one of the things that our

1112
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
guys noticed in their initial analysis

1113
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,280
was

1114
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,839
it waited a week or two before the dns

1115
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,520
request would start coming out so it was

1116
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,280
like in a it was in a stealth mode in

1117
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,599
terms of it load sit there quietly and

1118
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,520
they're just beaking up just quietly to

1119
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,440
see if if you could get dns requests out

1120
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
to one of the the tagged hosts

1121
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
if it could it generated uh command

1122
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
control traffic

1123
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
and it mimicked mimics

1124
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
the orion updates

1125
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
so very easy to you know in a common in

1126
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,280
a common sock with volume spraying

1127
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,480
everywhere

1128
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,839
to not even catch this thing right to

1129
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,880
see this thing like there's an around

1130
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,000
update going through yeah we've seen

1131
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,079
5000 of those this week great off we go

1132
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,200
next

1133
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
um so the timeline here is really really

1134
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,079
cool

1135
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,440
if we look at actually how this works

1136
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,720
i'm just going to dig this through from

1137
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,040
points one to six solarwinds orion

1138
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,240
downloads the malicious code

1139
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,800
sunburst checks through dns after that

1140
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,240
week or two like just literally a little

1141
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,079
beacon out like hey you know calling

1142
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:04,880
home

1143
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
response you know if it can get out gets

1144
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
the response back

1145
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,520
it then downloads and executes the

1146
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,359
cobalt strike attack

1147
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
that's the point

1148
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
and if you see murray around she's got

1149
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
the pink hair she's uh she spoke

1150
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,560
yesterday i think um she's the extra

1151
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
expert actually in the space

1152
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,520
um

1153
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,240
that's the part where the xdr component

1154
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,680
literally the endpoint component fires

1155
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,359
up and says yeah this is out of bounds

1156
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,720
this is beyond the processes that we

1157
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
accept

1158
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,280
quarantine the machine lock it down

1159
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,960
generate a signature alert the rest of

1160
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
the world like there's a problem here

1161
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,079
right it's based on that we then do the

1162
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,440
analysis and feed this out so the

1163
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
automated sock does its job the

1164
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,880
automatic technology does its job in

1165
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,160
concert these things need to feed

1166
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
together

1167
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,040
and be obviously programmed and

1168
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
reprogrammed and restructured together

1169
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,920
consistently

1170
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,839
and you know it had this failed cobalt

1171
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,240
strike would have serviced that c2

1172
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,079
lateral movement would occur

1173
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,079
exfiltration would happen

1174
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,520
and you'd be you know one of the many

1175
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,040
companies that uh that suffered through

1176
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,079
that and had

1177
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,480
a very panicked and uh

1178
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,880
and painful cleanup

1179
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
right

1180
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,359
so the game changer what do we have to

1181
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,000
do about these sort of things right

1182
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,480
ppt dynamic in play here

1183
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,839
modern prevention

1184
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:18,880
it's obviously technologies that

1185
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
actually prevent not just alert um

1186
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,760
strong configuration within those to

1187
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,839
maximize the capabilities within there

1188
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,359
i've had a number of conversations since

1189
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,599
i've been here since yesterday one of

1190
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,119
the things consistency is an industry

1191
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,480
that we fail on

1192
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
is we're very good at looking looking at

1193
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
what we need to do understanding you

1194
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,000
know to a large degree what is required

1195
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,680
of technologies to implement them and do

1196
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
things with them

1197
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,640
um actually doing that actually going

1198
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
through the pain of deploying them

1199
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,839
properly validating them again to

1200
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,319
ourselves through our peers and partners

1201
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
and third-party validation

1202
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,760
and making sure that we maximize what

1203
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,359
we're using and what we've got is an

1204
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,160
industry problem um

1205
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,599
you know there are ways to simplify that

1206
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,359
and automate some of that as well so i'd

1207
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,280
encourage you to think about that

1208
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,839
high fidelity alerts fast investigation

1209
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,480
so the speed to response is critical

1210
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
right have anything sit there again like

1211
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,359
the target example hey there's an alert

1212
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,880
crickets crickets cricket crickets hey

1213
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
what was that again it doesn't work like

1214
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,640
you you've got to be like it's got to be

1215
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,520
almost instantaneous um

1216
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,280
and the use of soar right security

1217
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,400
orchestration and remediation technology

1218
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,680
right the combination of those three

1219
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,960
things together

1220
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,720
has an absolute automatic impact on your

1221
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
sock right this is where you start to

1222
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
saying you know we don't need the people

1223
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,079
anymore because we can apply the

1224
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,160
technology in a very specific very

1225
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,319
useful very efficacious way

1226
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,560
get high fidelity input from that

1227
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,760
automate how we're going to deal with

1228
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,520
that and then the sock essentially falls

1229
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
into line as we start getting those

1230
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,160
beautiful inverted pyramid diagrams

1231
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,400
right the ideal here being a 30 30 30

1232
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
model

1233
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,720
30 of alert response 30 on hunting

1234
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,839
what's going on

1235
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,920
and then 30 percent on improvement and

1236
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
the key thing here is and this is like

1237
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,839
if you look at the john kinderweg zero

1238
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
trust approach

1239
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,960
one of the key things that john

1240
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,800
referenced to was like defining the

1241
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,319
approach defining how your zero trust

1242
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,520
philosophy is going to apply but you

1243
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,760
have to revalidate consistently

1244
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,119
right this is not a state in time and

1245
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,800
then walk away right we don't do this

1246
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
thing go to the beach forget about and

1247
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,560
come back in six weeks and hope it's all

1248
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,599
good this is an ongoing review ongoing

1249
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,200
check-in on what we're doing ongoing

1250
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
validation again ourselves our peers and

1251
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
third party

1252
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,400
to make sure we're doing the right

1253
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
things

1254
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
and so in a broad diagram how this would

1255
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,200
work is

1256
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,960
essentially on the left in the blue you

1257
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,000
have all the different you know

1258
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,079
technology components that you can apply

1259
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,680
and these are this is not exhaustive

1260
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,359
this is a representation of the common

1261
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,680
sort of things so firewall of some type

1262
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,160
you know assess security of some type

1263
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,040
um

1264
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,880
cloud security app you know mechanisms

1265
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
of different types

1266
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,319
some sort of assassin approach and then

1267
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,400
potentially xdr component within there

1268
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,280
as well

1269
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,640
um

1270
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,720
xdr just being you know edr but that it

1271
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,400
covers more than just the endpoint is

1272
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,680
the what the x is for so looking at that

1273
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,960
we cover the reconnaissance phase

1274
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,720
weaponization exploitation

1275
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,319
and your installation phase with

1276
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,480
technology very specifically focused and

1277
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,240
set to deal with those things

1278
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,520
and then when we get to come on and

1279
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,560
control your lateral movement

1280
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,440
and the actions on the objectives

1281
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
that's where you look at you know

1282
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,839
looking at the threat analysis and

1283
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,319
hunting components and feed that out to

1284
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,079
essentially what i'm arguing for is a

1285
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,760
playbook type approach

1286
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,280
right automating everything that you can

1287
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
within that is key

1288
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,200
so just an example of a stock playbook

1289
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,599
structure um

1290
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,960
a lot of people when they when they talk

1291
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
about saw

1292
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,560
you know have some concerns about the

1293
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,319
complexities involved you know the

1294
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,800
nuance of their environments in terms of

1295
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,520
their geographic you know dispersal

1296
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
the networks the history of the networks

1297
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,680
who who knows and owns everything

1298
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,119
simple example i talked to the banks in

1299
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,440
canada awful lot um you know there are

1300
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,040
people that that are at the bank as an

1301
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,280
example just one of the major banks

1302
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,920
he's got one guy he's the proxy guy and

1303
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,119
the reason why they can't get rid of the

1304
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,400
proxy is because brad knows it

1305
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,839
right he's the guy that runs that

1306
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,839
infrastructure and that's his guarantee

1307
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,599
of you know future security is that he's

1308
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,800
he's the only one essentially that can

1309
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,839
run that stuff

1310
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,599
um there's an awful lot of that sort of

1311
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,720
siloing and fiefdoms that go on

1312
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,200
when you try and apply a saw technology

1313
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,800
into spaces like that you have to

1314
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,319
involve people all over the place all

1315
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,520
these different fiefdoms lots of

1316
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,680
conversations lots of true understanding

1317
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
of what the network actually has

1318
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,920
right so when my little

1319
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,119
you know instance of something that

1320
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,720
happens to be in a caribbean bank and

1321
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,560
beacons out wants a once a quarter to

1322
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,440
give me an input you know via the old

1323
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
x you know x86 modem or whatever it is

1324
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,040
that's still communicating with us and

1325
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
it's the banking thing that nobody's

1326
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,400
allowed to touch because it still works

1327
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,520
things like that that are just little

1328
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,720
abstracts out there and that's obviously

1329
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,319
a silly example but

1330
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,440
when you have things like that in your

1331
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,800
environment that people don't understand

1332
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,880
or that have poorly understood

1333
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,560
they really become the corner cases for

1334
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,319
soar and get interesting in terms of how

1335
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,839
you can apply them

1336
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,440
i'm here to say

1337
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,560
playbook approach saw approach is really

1338
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,119
well understood is very well documented

1339
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,359
and the best thing about it is

1340
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
for the most part the vendors that

1341
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,359
produce and derive these technologies

1342
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,079
have massive communities who share with

1343
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,680
each other playbooks that they've

1344
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,720
already generated for different

1345
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,800
instances so this is not a day one thing

1346
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,560
of like hey we're gonna go to 40 you

1347
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,720
know from 42 ftes down to eight

1348
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,240
because all the stuff exists of course

1349
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
there's work that's involved

1350
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
but i'm here to say that you know with

1351
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,440
all the complexity that we represent out

1352
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,599
in a slide like that and this is really

1353
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,359
just an abstract of the high level sort

1354
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,680
of approach um

1355
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,200
a lot of the stuff's already been done a

1356
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,480
lot of it's public

1357
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,160
you know you can go to github for

1358
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,760
domestic as an example or phantom and

1359
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,960
you can actually see like what people

1360
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,560
have done what they're sharing what's

1361
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,520
current

1362
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
um variations of what's been done before

1363
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,800
it's it's all there

1364
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,400
so that makes things really interesting

1365
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,680
so what you want to break it out to

1366
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,119
think about is

1367
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,880
incident based playbooks

1368
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,960
analysis sub playbooks right again

1369
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,560
thinking about that that funnel that i

1370
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,839
drew

1371
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,280
indicator scripts

1372
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
breaks those upon the trigger upon you

1373
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,560
know detail gathering for further

1374
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,119
analysis or further supportive decision

1375
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,960
containment

1376
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,119
escalation remediation

1377
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,280
and then post incident metrics and

1378
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
re-improvement

1379
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,480
right so it seems like a bit of an eye

1380
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,560
chart seems pretty complex it's really

1381
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,440
really that not that that awful at all

1382
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,119
this is one of the argument areas for

1383
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,040
sock as a service

1384
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,240
right there's a lot of stuff that can go

1385
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,359
into this

1386
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,040
um there's a lot of work to be put into

1387
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,839
place

1388
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,680
and experts in the sock fields experts

1389
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,440
around saw can really make everyone's

1390
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,960
life a lot easier by coming in and

1391
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
working with you guys doing analysis of

1392
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,000
what you have

1393
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,359
binding it then into this type of an

1394
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,280
infrastructure

1395
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
so i said earlier there was a slide on

1396
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
here that would talk about the fte

1397
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,160
component and you know how you can

1398
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,880
rationalize time against cost and time

1399
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,480
of doing these technologies just a quick

1400
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,240
brief one in here

1401
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,040
um

1402
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,560
this is a real example it's our own

1403
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,280
obviously so just bear with us on that

1404
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,640
key things in here

1405
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,720
in terms of savings automation types

1406
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,400
enriching the alerts

1407
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,599
1090 alerts enriched gives us 635 hours

1408
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,119
back right

1409
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,440
deduplication of alerts like 7 700 of

1410
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,920
those gives us 648 hours back and so as

1411
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,599
you go down here i mean i'm not going to

1412
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,680
read through each one the eye chart is

1413
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,119
is good

1414
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,200
the message there is

1415
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
in one month if we can say 1400 hours

1416
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,200
that's a real that's a real turnaround

1417
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,359
in fte and that's the point right we so

1418
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,680
we draw the we draw the the funnel

1419
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,920
reference eight fds give you the example

1420
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,079
here and of course these go on for all

1421
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,440
different components of your network all

1422
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,280
different components of your life um

1423
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,559
including the bottom one their other

1424
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,800
jobs is like all the other little menial

1425
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,920
you know interesting things that could

1426
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,079
go on i mean you can even use xor

1427
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,599
technologies as an example to do

1428
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,960
automatic onboarding and off-boarding of

1429
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,720
personnel right unless you just have

1430
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,520
that as a playbook right joey's leaving

1431
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,680
kelly's leaving put them through there

1432
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,520
just off-board them it's done but it's

1433
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,400
very straightforward

1434
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,760
and so where this brings us to

1435
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,680
is and this is a really an agnostic

1436
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,839
slide this is kind of a panacea there's

1437
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,040
a vision of the future for what we'd

1438
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
like to see as an industry this is where

1439
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,359
things can be really useful

1440
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,040
this is the perfect sort of new world

1441
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,000
right a new sec ops team so

1442
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,800
reset the table reset expectations get

1443
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,160
away from the old views and look at

1444
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,119
these

1445
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,480
you want to assess and organize all your

1446
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,200
alerts and infrastructures around there

1447
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,359
look at your roles and responsibilities

1448
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,880
what interfaces they touch and have

1449
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,119
access to and can implement

1450
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,520
look at operational establishment

1451
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,440
sorry enablement

1452
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,119
proactive visibility how that can be

1453
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,200
applied where it's useful

1454
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,359
what metrics you require reporting and

1455
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,359
again across the three spaces your own

1456
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,640
peers and partners and then third party

1457
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,720
autonomous security operations largely

1458
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,319
the function of this talk

1459
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,000
and then continuous improvement and

1460
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,520
again you know referencing john's

1461
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,960
foundational paint in the paper from

1462
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,839
2010 continuous improvement is a theme

1463
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,760
that we should all be pursuing at all

1464
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,040
times as cyber security practitioners

1465
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,800
so that is the talk i'd love some

1466
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,839
questions

1467
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,799
and i'll thank you for your time

1468
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,359
yes please

1469
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,960
yep microphone's on its way

1470
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,160
okay this has nothing to do with my

1471
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,440
workshop coming up

1472
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,960
but i am curious how you would um

1473
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,000
integrate

1474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,720
deception tech honeypot technologies and

1475
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,480
etc into today's sock and how you expand

1476
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,200
your

1477
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,079
your detection capabilities 100 so like

1478
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,680
anything you have that has an input that

1479
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,520
is useful and valid like those

1480
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,760
technologies you can absolutely feed in

1481
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,440
as part of your playbooks to give you

1482
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,839
inputs towards your analysis

1483
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,440
so analysis isn't just from those

1484
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,880
security technologies i referenced there

1485
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,720
which are like commercial they can be

1486
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,800
anything so like oceans you can take

1487
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,040
deception technologies you can even take

1488
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
partner inputs um

1489
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,480
you know so one of the things you see in

1490
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,760
industry these days is more and more

1491
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
stuff around sharing of iocs and you

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,280
know the commercial scale where there's

1493
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
10 000 plus a day that we all share with

1494
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,520
each other or more they can take those

1495
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,880
inputs and feed them all through in the

1496
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,800
same time as well that's tremendously

1497
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,680
valuable input thank you

1498
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,240
none of this none of the sock guys are

1499
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,960
going to throw tomatoes come on

1500
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,119
i was promised this i feel let down

1501
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
oh well yeah

1502
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,040
that that's very gratifying anyway so

1503
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,559
thank you very much
