1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,360
foreign

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
okay now do you all need to stand up and

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
shake up a little bit

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
you're good to keep going

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
all right

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,320
so i'm uh going to introduce you to the

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
next speaker

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
that's uh dave manucheri

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
the security analyst for ai dot moda

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
now david started his professional cyber

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,120
security career half a decade ago after

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,360
being recruited by the department of

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
national defense

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
he has since worked with the startup

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
linchpin labs which is acquired by l3

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
harris technologies and started up his

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,480
own company

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,800
after becoming an independent security

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
analyst consultant in 2020

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,719
he has found and disclosed half a dozen

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
chrome zero days

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,959
aside from his professional experience

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
he has over a decade of experience with

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
linux security and being personally

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
targeted by apts

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
in his free time

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
david enjoys researching cyber security

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
trends in the industry

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,479
so i welcome david manitori to the stage

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,039
and don't panic

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
all right is mighty working sounds good

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,399
thank you for the intro and thank you

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,759
for being in this dark room instead of

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,399
outside by the beach

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,200
so a bit of background on this talk uh

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
if you're very technical

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
there is going to be a couple things

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,560
that are relevant that you'll enjoy

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
i keep thinking this talk isn't relevant

40
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
technically anymore and then every

41
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,200
couple of months somebody asked me a

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
question like oh

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
here's what you need to do but if you're

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
not technical don't worry

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
i am going to go over

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,318
i'm going to try to make it

47
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,878
understandable for everyone

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,599
so

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,400
bio already had a good introduction but

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
the main thing i'm just trying to point

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
out here is i have done a fair amount of

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
disclosures

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
so i'm familiar with when disclosures go

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
well and when they go poorly this is a

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
story of one that

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
didn't go well

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
i do have a gap

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
because i worked for the government they

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
don't want you to say anything

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
so for anyone who's not canadian which

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
is probably about a quarter of the

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,519
audience but uh rogers it's a large

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,680
canadian isp

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,599
at the time that this story is going to

65
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
be taking place this is the beginning of

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,280
2017

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
so they have a little over 2 million

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
about 2.2 million users

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
hitron is a

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
company based in taiwan they mostly make

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,640
like cable modems so you know

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
the stuff that like you know you see

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
like logic have

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,840
the supplier hitron's one of those

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,959
companies now

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,800
i haven't been able to find any hard

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
numbers on

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,280
how many modems rogers has that are from

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
hitron the only number i was able to

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,000
find is that

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
hitron overall

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,159
globally has shipped 40 million or so

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,360
devices

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,239
with rogers i believe it's

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
it looks like a little over half of

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
their modems at the time were hitron so

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
my guess is around a million i don't

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
have hard numbers on that so

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
that's just speculation

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
now for

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
some people who have dealt with iot

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
this name might be familiar uh mirai

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
it's a it was or it's not as big anymore

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
it's a botnet

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
mostly targeted

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
embedded and iot devices and it mostly

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
yeah it had it kind of its peak in 2016

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
and 2017.

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
now

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
this botnet in my opinion was not as

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
impressive or not as scary as it could

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
have been it mostly was used just to

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
take down websites

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
uh the thing that's kind of scary with

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
these type of botnets is even that this

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,319
particular one

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
only really just tried to do ddos

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,159
attacks

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,239
if you have a botnet like this you can

110
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,439
do a lot more than just take down

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
websites if you have a botnet that is

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
you know everyone's modem

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
you can do a fair amount of stuff now

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
you can't see like encrypted traffic but

115
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
you can still determine you know what

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,639
websites every single person's visiting

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
even with ssl

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
that's still

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
possible

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
so this particular botnet in my opinion

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
wasn't as scary as it could have been

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,280
but

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
it's scary knowing that

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,160
it could have been a lot worse

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
uh mira's mirai is also interesting

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
because the source code was leaked so

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
you don't have to do any fans

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
fancy reverse engineering which i don't

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
like doing

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
so i promise this is the only code graph

131
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
and you don't even really need to pay

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
too much attention to it but the way

133
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
miri works for

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,160
finding other devices to infect is

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
basically tries random ipv4 addresses on

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
the internet

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
so just randomly tries an ip address and

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
checks uh it tries two ports it tries

139
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
port 23

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
and 23 23 and it just randomly tries to

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
pick those

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
not very advanced

143
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,639
but surprisingly this works

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
remember remember that number 23 and

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
2023 it will come back later

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
and

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
i'm going to go over a bit about what

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
code injection is

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,120
so

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
and don't worry i promise this all ties

151
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
together so this is a tweet i put out

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
where

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
usually like on a modem

154
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
if you don't work for the isp it's not

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
you know yours

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
usually you're not supposed to be able

157
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
to run commands on it so command

158
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,479
injection is a class of vulnerabilities

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
where you're able to run

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
commands on something that usually

161
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
shouldn't

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
so this command injection

163
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
for this to work you have to be locally

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,880
on the network so this is not remotely

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,639
accessible it's only if you're on the

166
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
same network now i know there's a few of

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,919
you who are probably judging a little

168
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
bit that i tweeted this

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
don't worry

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
i did google it first

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,360
one of my friends actually disclosed it

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
like a year before i did

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,199
so

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,440
this was not

175
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
the first instance this had already been

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
known for quite a while i was a bit

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
disappointed when i thought i was first

178
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
not even close

179
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,639
now

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,680
when my friend disclosed it

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
he didn't make a sarcastic tweet so it

182
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
when it got ignored

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
uh turns out sarcastic tweets do get

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
responses very quickly

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,280
so about

186
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
within a week

187
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,120
rogers had fixed this issue

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
which was kind of surprising to me i'm

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
like oh i guess i guess people do

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
sometimes read stuff but only on twitter

191
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
now i'd come forgotten about this moved

192
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,639
on

193
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
and i tweeted this which this is

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
i'll explain what's going on here

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
so you have

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,599
i think everyone for the most part is

197
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,919
familiar with what an ip address is

198
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,599
now there's

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
basically two

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,919
there's ipv4 which is what everyone's

201
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,720
used to you know 1.2.3.4

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
there's also ipv6

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
ipv6 it's a much larger address space

204
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
it's people often forget about it it

205
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
does exist it's not not as commonly used

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
but yet it is there so

207
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
what this is is

208
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,880
uh

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
the firewall on this particular device

210
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,120
on this modem

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,680
uh they had forgotten to configure the

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
firewall rules for ipv6 they've done it

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
for four but not six

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
now

215
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
also in this tweet

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,879
again i didn't put it in there but

217
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,120
for the ipv6 part here

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
this is only accessible if you're on the

219
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
local network

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
so i'm able to now reach telnet on port

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,960
23

222
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,319
but again only if i'm on the local

223
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
network

224
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
so on a scale of like one to ten about

225
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
how big of an issue this is i would say

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
like one or two

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
um

228
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
it's just like an initial

229
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
you would still have to

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
you know be on the network which is

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
usually once you're on the network then

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,199
you don't really care about attacking

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
the modem

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
so yeah again a you know a one or two

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
it's only just a minor misconfiguration

236
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
they've you know they blocked it on ipv4

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
but not ipv6

238
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
now here's my disclaimer slide

239
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
everything i've talked about before here

240
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,599
uh

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
it's i can prove it it's you know fact

242
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
everything after this point this is

243
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
speculation this is before canada had a

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
mandatory disclosure law

245
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
so this is from all the slides on here's

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
my recreation you be the judge the times

247
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
match up suspiciously

248
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
so it's speculation but it probably

249
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,319
happened

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
so

251
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
after i made that last tweet uh

252
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,839
it seems like probably somebody at

253
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,440
rogers panicked a little bit it's like

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
oh no like this must be a serious issue

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
we got to do something

256
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
so here's my guess of what happened so

257
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,880
they saw this is the original um

258
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
thing that i tweeted where you know you

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
can see

260
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
when you connect to uh through ipv4 you

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
can see that you know

262
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
telnet is open so they saw this was like

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
okay we got to fix this we don't want to

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
see open

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
all right so they they changed the port

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,600
so now port 23 shows is closed

267
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,399
great

268
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
yeah mission accomplished

269
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
here's the thing though what the actual

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
issue is and you don't need to

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,839
worry about most of the the syntax

272
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,279
here through firewall rules and this

273
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
again this is my recreation of what i

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
assume it is

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
is

276
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,560
they were blocking port you know 22 and

277
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
23

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
for ipv4

279
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
but the the firewall rules are different

280
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
between ipv4 and ipv6

281
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,640
so

282
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
the issue was not

283
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
the port number

284
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
changing the port is

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
not really the wasn't really the issue

286
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
all they had to do was just

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,079
have those exact same firewall rules uh

288
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
for the other

289
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
uh for ibb v6 as well

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,720
that's all they had to do

291
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
now

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
the thing is is i like i can still

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
change i don't have to scan for 23. i

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
can just check 23.23

295
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
and yet now it's it's still open

296
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
changing the port did nothing

297
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,959
and not only did it do nothing

298
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,279
because their firewall rules were for

299
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
ipv4

300
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,880
we're only blocking port

301
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,279
22 and 23.

302
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,160
now it's accessible via ipv4 as well

303
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,079
so they've opened it up to the local

304
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,760
network which is not great

305
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,839
they've also now opened it up

306
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,200
accidentally because their firewall

307
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
rules they changed the port and they

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
didn't change the firewall rules before

309
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
now they've opened up telnet to the

310
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,480
internet

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
on 23 23.

312
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
now this is an issue

313
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,439
a very very big issue

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
and

315
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
yeah after i you know

316
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
tweeted that i completely forgot about

317
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
it and then now we're talking maybe a

318
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
year close to a year later

319
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,440
i see this post on hacker news

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
so i click it

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
and it's some it's an anonymous person

322
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
talking about how

323
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
they tried as a hobby

324
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,480
to

325
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
interfere with botnets to make them not

326
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
work

327
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
so you know the guy talks about what he

328
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
was doing and even talks about a

329
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,120
timeline

330
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,399
and there's one part of the timeline

331
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
that really caught my eye and it's this

332
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
part where he says you know in late

333
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
january 202 2017

334
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
the first genuine uh large-scale isp

335
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
takedown occurred when rogers

336
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
uh in canada carelessly pushed out a new

337
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
firmware

338
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,240
with an authenticated root shell of

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,880
singapore 2323

340
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
that date looks very familiar to me

341
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
very familiar

342
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,440
extremely familiar

343
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
so this is where again this is

344
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,399
speculation

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,200
but i'm gonna put two and two together

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,720
and say that they're probably related

347
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
and as i mentioned earlier with the uh

348
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
now it's listing on the internet

349
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,959
even then i didn't notice because i'm

350
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,160
busy doing other stuff in life

351
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
that automated scanner where i mentioned

352
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
it was getting on port 23 in 2023

353
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,920
it was discovered by botnets basically

354
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
instantly

355
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,440
and this person this anonymous person's

356
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
claiming that it breaks a large number

357
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,839
of modems

358
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,160
now this is anonymous you know maybe

359
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
maybe we shouldn't believe that person

360
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
maybe they're just making this story up

361
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
for internet fame so let's check reddit

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
all right one person's reporting about

363
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
it all right let's check rogers uh they

364
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
have a they have a message board let's

365
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
check them

366
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,839
uh people are reporting about brick

367
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,519
modems

368
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,040
more people

369
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
but these are all just regular users

370
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
right

371
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
okay here's a rogers employee saying

372
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
that there's some brick modems that's

373
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
not great

374
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
and then so ideally when you

375
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
do a blender like this maybe you know

376
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
you can just like push another update

377
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
and fix it

378
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
so let's see what the the fix is so

379
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
again this is a rogers employee now at

380
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,760
this point saying you know if you have

381
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
one of these modems which by the way it

382
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
was more modems than this

383
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,880
uh

384
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,519
you have to go into a physical store to

385
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880
swap it

386
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,839
because they can't fix it

387
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
remotely so this again they don't have

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,639
to they didn't have to disclose this but

389
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
i imagine having

390
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
thousands of people across the country

391
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
need to return a modem

392
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
just like in shipping and fees

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
uh engineering time

394
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440
it definitely wasn't cheap uh

395
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
probably a couple hundred thousand is my

396
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,560
guess for like how much they had to

397
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,880
spend on engineering time

398
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
for this which was never an issue

399
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
shouldn't have been an issue in the

400
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
first place

401
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
because

402
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
you know first of all these none of

403
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
these issues were

404
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,440
new like you know the first one

405
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
it wasn't unknown it was already known

406
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,639
uh

407
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
so you have to actually like look for

408
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
things not just things that are popular

409
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
when it comes to your network i think

410
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
that applies for a lot of people here

411
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,279
like you know

412
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
if you just see log4js in the news don't

413
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,839
just look for that issue i'm sure

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,000
there's other issues

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
don't just pick what's in the news to

416
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
focus on

417
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,720
you can also communicate with the

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
security community i love that everyone

419
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
is out here today

420
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
you know when i talked about the

421
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
you know firewall rules that they just

422
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,240
needed to apply it the same between the

423
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
both if they just asked me on twitter

424
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,800
what would i what i recommended i would

425
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,760
have told them that and i would have

426
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,880
saved them probably a lot of money uh

427
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
so yeah you can communicate i've never

428
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
found out who the rogers employee is

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
who follows me um yeah they're welcome

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,440
to reach out if they ever hear this talk

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,399
and also don't rush so

432
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,120
from

433
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
my guess of the situation is that you

434
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
know they saw that oh no the port is

435
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,440
open

436
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
on 23.

437
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
we just want to make that go away

438
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,240
let's just fix that so they fixed that i

439
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
used the word fix and quotes

440
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
so yeah it's no longer accessible on 23

441
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
but now it's accessible

442
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,920
on 23 23 to the whole internet

443
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
so you've gone from

444
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,519
the solutions much worse than the

445
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
original problem

446
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,519
you got to think things through even

447
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
even if you just want to like go to bed

448
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,959
and push it out maybe you know deal with

449
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,279
the next day uh

450
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
when it comes to security if you're just

451
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
constantly putting out fires you're

452
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,360
probably creating new ones behind you

453
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
and also just don't panic like uh from

454
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
from what i've seen from this whole

455
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,519
situation i don't think there was any

456
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,399
sort of

457
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,639
disaster type plan

458
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,000
uh

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
there i don't think there's any rollout

460
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
testing you know once the once you push

461
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
a fix for security i'll use log4js as an

462
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,839
example

463
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,120
once you

464
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
have rolled it out to your environment

465
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
how do you actually are you actually

466
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
checking to make sure

467
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,399
it is rolled out

468
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
and it is solving the problem that you

469
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
want to solve if you don't have a plan

470
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
uh yeah you're probably going to panic

471
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,800
and

472
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
break thousands of your customers modems

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,880
yeah that's my talk

474
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,240
[Applause]

475
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,279
i think we

476
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,839
do we have time
