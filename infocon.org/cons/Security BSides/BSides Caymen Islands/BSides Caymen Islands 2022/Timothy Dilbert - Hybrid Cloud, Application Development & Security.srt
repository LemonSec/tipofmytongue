00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
i'm going to invite up our next speaker

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
mr timothy dilbert the ceo of bmt

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
solutions now timothy has been in

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,920
software development for more than 13

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,320
years with seven years in his current

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,199
position at bmt solutions

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,199
during his tenure timothy has been

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,800
fortunate enough to do software

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
development in six different countries

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
working for clients in the public sector

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,720
retail utilities education and financial

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,079
services

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
development has certainly always been

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
something timothy has been passionate

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,040
about and these days he's focusing on

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
bridging the gap between security

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,079
infrastructure and development by using

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
automation and hybrid cloud

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
now when timothy is not sitting in front

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,440
of a computer he spends time with his

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
family especially each weekend cooking

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,239
new recipes with his four-year-old

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
daughter avery so i'm going to invite

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
timothy to the stage to talk about

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,280
hybrid cloud

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
application development and security

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
okay

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
i think this is too short for

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
maintenance

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
all right

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
testing one two

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
testing one two

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
okay

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
right back okay great stuff

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
hello everyone my name is timothy

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,479
dilbert welcome to hybrid cloud

37
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
application development and security

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
uh the goal for today is to

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
give you an introduction to what all

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
these terms mean

41
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,399
and hopefully with you leaving having an

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
understanding of how it's applicable to

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
you and your organizations

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
so first of all let me start off with

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
saying this talk is not just for the

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,319
geeks

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,200
don't laugh these are my people

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
i am a geek myself

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,720
obviously not very good with the clicker

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,239
if your company leaders are in the

51
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,440
building but they're not in the

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,599
presentation here now is a good time to

53
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
go grab them

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239
the idea here like ms jane had mentioned

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,879
is to bridge the gap between the techie

56
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
guys us geeks as well as the decision

57
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
makers in your company

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
so if you're a business leader

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
that's making decisions about budgets

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
and i t manager

61
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
that manages the team creating a

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
strategy for your company and a vision

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
for the future

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
or a software developer doing the grunt

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
work

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
uh the idea here is to make

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,599
the things that you want your business

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
leaders to buy for you

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
make them understand the technologies

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,959
make them feel good about spending the

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
money that they need to spend for those

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,159
things and make them understand the

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,280
value

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,640
that these things bring to their

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
organization

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,599
so to start off with

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,000
my name is timothy dilbert

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
i am the or i carry the title of ceo at

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
bmt solutions

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,400
that being said i do get my hands dirty

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,799
from day to day i would consider myself

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
more so than anything else a software

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
developer

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,959
so i definitely understand the

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
underlying technologies the underside

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
stacks that the developers in the room

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
use on day-to-day basis

88
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
i've worked

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,159
in

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,360
i got to get used to this i keep

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
switching here and not up here

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
i've worked in canada cayman islands

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
name a few

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
uh and industries like legal utilities

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
education gaming

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
and then through bmt and other third

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
parties i've worked for companies in

98
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
countries like canada cayman bermuda

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
south africa nigeria and a few other

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,599
ones

101
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
i went to school in canada vancouver

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,640
canada

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
i studied graphic design but after a few

104
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,519
conversations with some of the

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
professors there they mentioned to me

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
that software developers make more money

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
so that made that switch easy

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
at the time my favorite platform was

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
adobe flash

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
and uh my favorite language was

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
actionscript

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
not sure if you guys remember the 2000s

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,600
but just about all the great websites

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
were built in adobe flash at the time

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
in my opinion an absolutely brilliant

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
brilliant platform i wish it had uh

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
stood the test of time but alas it

118
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,239
hasn't

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
while i was in canada one of the things

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
i one of the projects i worked on was

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
big bucks footy

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
so big bucks footy was a fantasy

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
football game

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
uh this was before fantasy football

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
became as as kind of prevalent as is now

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
i bet you a lot of you are probably in

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
some sort of fantasy football league or

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
you have someone very close to you that

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
is part of one back then it wasn't so

130
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
prevalent it was one of these things

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
that just a few people

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
a few groups of people did

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
my involvement on that platform was i

134
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,440
built the ui for it so that would allow

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
you to kind of big bucks footy would

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
allow you to watch the fantasy football

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
games in real time you can kind of see

138
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
the ball being passed around between all

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
the people

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
uh you can watch the fatigue of your

141
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
players and

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
sub people in and out and my job was to

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
build a user interface that people used

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
to do that sort of stuff

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
while i was in canada i also started a

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
company called go rent canada

147
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,280
that was me and a friend of mine scott

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,479
and that was a multi-listings apartment

149
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,440
multi-lingual apartment listings

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
platform

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
so in canada

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
or in vancouver if you're not familiar

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,840
with it vancouver is a very very

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
multicultural city

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
absolutely fantastic place if you

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
haven't visited i would put it on the

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,919
list

158
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,400
it's a gateway to asia

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
it has

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
because a lot of movies are shot in

161
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,400
vancouver there's a lot of innovation

162
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
and technology brought up from the

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
united states there

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,639
it has a massive persian community

165
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
and those in my opinion are some of the

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,520
most innovative and hardworking people

167
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,039
i've ever come across

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
and with them they bring a lot of

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,319
innovation and a lot of culture

170
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
from where they're from and uh

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
at the the end result of that is kind of

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,479
like what you have here in cayman it's a

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
very very multicultural area

174
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
the idea behind the platform that me and

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
scott had was uh we got sick of craig's

176
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
list

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
you go on there you're looking for a

178
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
place to rent

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
landlords speak various languages

180
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
it's hard to find the apartment that

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
you're looking for

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
so we built go rent canada what it

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,199
allowed people to do is it didn't matter

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
what language you spoke you could go on

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,080
to our platform post a listing about a

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,759
vacancy that you had

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
in whatever language that you had it in

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
and we would automatically show that in

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
over 14 different languages

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
so english farsi

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
simplified chinese traditional chinese

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
korean french

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
german russian

194
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,919
and i'm sure there's a lot of other ones

195
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,199
that i'm missing out

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,440
on

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,680
so

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
there you go this is my office

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
not literally i wish it was

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
i'm sure all of us do

201
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
but i am from the cayman islands this is

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
the place that i call home

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
uh cayman is a fantastic place where

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
innovation thrives

205
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
it's a this country is constantly

206
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
reinventing ourselves we're always out

207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,360
doing ourselves

208
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,840
and it's a place where nothing seems

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,120
impossible

210
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
i consider myself very lucky even though

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
i'm born here even though i've raised

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
here i still consider myself as i'm sure

213
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
everybody else in the room that's

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
resident here

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
believes which is that uh we're very

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
very fortunate to be in a country where

217
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
all those things that i was saying

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
before is genuinely the case

219
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,440
where anything is possible

220
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
these are some of the

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
different technologies i've worked with

222
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
over the years

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
i've seen some familiar faces in the

224
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,080
room you'll probably know me from

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
sharepoint i've been doing that for the

226
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
better part of 15 years or so

227
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
i work with these when i work with these

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
technologies it's generally connecting

229
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,680
desperate systems together right or some

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
sort of integration work

231
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,279
maybe i'm connecting systems together

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,279
maybe i'm doing document management some

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,279
analytics pulling data from one platform

234
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
to another and crunching numbers on it

235
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,719
automation

236
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,599
those sort of things

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,680
these days i'm primarily focused on

238
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
products from the companies like what

239
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
you see on here if you're not seeing

240
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,360
microsoft don't take that the wrong way

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
i've definitely it's still a lot

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
available a lot of work in sharepoint

243
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
it's just that these are kind of the the

244
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,399
companies that i've been focused on

245
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,600
lately

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
ibm red hat open shift red hat ansible

247
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,640
and then ibm products like mass 360

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
verified guardium privilege vault things

249
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
like that

250
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
i'm also familiar with tools in cayman

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
like i manage adorant

252
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
and

253
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
aws azure etc

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,839
interestingly i heard wolfgang talk

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
about this yesterday

256
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
and he was talking about

257
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
chaos engineering

258
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
for those of you that looked at that and

259
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
you found that interesting you should be

260
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
taking a look at ansible

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
ansible in my opinion is a great

262
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
platform to do chaos engineering it

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
allows you to create playbooks that you

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
can kind of lightly break your

265
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,920
environment if you will

266
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
so rather than kind of going into your

267
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,839
data center and unplugging a server and

268
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
seeing if everything goes down

269
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
uh maybe you just want to disable a nic

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
on your vm host

271
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
see if just if your v your

272
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
various virtual machines have failed

273
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,920
over to the next server and if they

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
haven't you can quickly re-enable it

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,360
your downtime is only a few minutes and

276
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
you've got an opportunity to kind of

277
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
speak

278
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
to whoever is in charge of the

279
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,160
resiliency of your systems

280
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,000
so

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
but we're here to talk about development

282
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
and

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
so let's let's get on to the topic again

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
and let's start with a very basic

285
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
question what is an application

286
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
for a lot of you you're probably

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
thinking i know i already know what that

288
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
is it's the app on my phone that i shout

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
at

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
it's the thing i complained to the help

291
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,360
desk about

292
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
or it's the wizard that times out right

293
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
after you stepped away from your

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,320
computer for a few minutes

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
what what

296
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,680
an application boils down to however is

297
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
a key phrase that i've come up with and

298
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,560
i've

299
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,279
been telling myself over the years

300
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,600
and it's really helped kind of govern my

301
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
thoughts whenever i'm thinking about how

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
to architect something

303
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
and and that is that an application is

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
multiple layers of critical services

305
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
packaged together and sold as a single

306
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,079
unit

307
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
so from a technology perspective

308
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
you know the top layer the red part

309
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
that's going to be your ui

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
then you're moving down the stack you've

311
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,959
got your customizations authentication

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
and authorization apis and data stores

313
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
from a business user's perspective the

314
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
top layer is your specialty that's what

315
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
your product does

316
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,240
maybe you are a

317
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
compliance engine right

318
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,079
maybe you are a great book for a school

319
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,000
this could be file opening for a law

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
firm whatever it is that your

321
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
application does

322
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
the second layer down

323
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
if you've purchased this application

324
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
from a third party that's the place

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
where you go to make customizations to

326
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
that step out of box application to make

327
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
it better fit your company's needs

328
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
if you're building a platform this is

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
the framework that you've created to

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
allow someone else to do the same

331
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,519
let's skip over security for a second

332
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
and move to the bottom two one

333
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
reading and writing of information

334
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
that's your business logic you're not

335
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
developing a spreadsheet you want your

336
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
application to be smart it needs to have

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
validation business logic checks do

338
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
something to add value to whatever

339
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
people are purchasing and at the

340
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,639
bottom layer is that where your data

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
ultimately resides

342
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,839
maybe your data goes into some sort of

343
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,480
back-end system maybe it interfaces with

344
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
some third-party platform

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
if you're trading maybe it's at the end

346
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
of all of this

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
it issues a trade

348
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
on some sort of stock exchange

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
or maybe it just pushes it in the back

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
end system for you to crunch data

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
opens files in your file opening your

352
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
document management whatever it is that

353
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
this this application does

354
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
now i want to go back to that middle one

355
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
that i skipped out though

356
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
security

357
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
it's important for the business leaders

358
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
in the room to take a close look at

359
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
security

360
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,600
because in my opinion this is what i

361
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
think sema was also after when they were

362
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
talking about their cyber security

363
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
framework

364
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
whether you these these are applications

365
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
that you use to create offerings

366
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
that you

367
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
put out there in the market and you sell

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,160
to other people

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,519
it doesn't matter whether you've built

370
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,440
this application or you're buying

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
someone else's application the security

372
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,760
element is part of your responsibility

373
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,399
because it is included in the service

374
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
that you're offering to someone else

375
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
so business leaders that are in the room

376
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,800
need to keep that need to keep conscious

377
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
of that

378
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
so that when you're when you're being

379
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,199
approached when you're making decisions

380
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
on things that you're keeping that in

381
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,160
the forefront of your mind and i think

382
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,040
that was part of what the whole idea was

383
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
when mentioning cyber security

384
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,880
so now

385
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
that is your application stack let's

386
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,160
talk about technology a little

387
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
there's two terms i want to cover

388
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
that um i think it's important to kind

389
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
of go over before we go too far into

390
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
this

391
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
so these those two terms are monolithic

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,519
for and micro services

393
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,880
these two terms are used everywhere

394
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
business leaders are seeing it in their

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
proposals

396
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
your i.t managers are seeing it in the

397
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
conferences that they go to and webinars

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
they attend your developers are seeing

399
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
it in their training session but almost

400
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,040
nobody knows what it means

401
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
it's not that it's complicated to

402
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
understand it's just sometimes it can be

403
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
a little tricky to explain so let's go

404
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,000
over this and i'm going to try my best

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
to cover this in a way that makes sense

406
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,519
we'll start off with the monolithic

407
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
architecture and for

408
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
business people that are in the room i

409
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
promise this is the techie part and it

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
will be over very soon but it is

411
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
important for you to understand this

412
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
monolithic means that everything's

413
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
self-contained

414
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
and this illustration is a great example

415
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
of what that mean a great representation

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
of that

417
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,600
everything's together packaged together

418
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
almost always put on a single server

419
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
most of the software you purchased in

420
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,160
the last 10 years would be will be a

421
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,399
monolithic structure

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
and the best indicator of this is that

423
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
when you find a vendor that offers a

424
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
service that you want the first thing

425
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
your vendor says is i need a server

426
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
i want my own server so that i can put

427
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
my application on this and nobody else's

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,759
stuff can be on there

429
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
and at least in my experience

430
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,680
this is one of the number one reasons

431
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
for server sprawl you have a hundred

432
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
applications

433
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,399
in your environment you have a hundred

434
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,399
servers

435
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,199
there's a movement happening however

436
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,639
to to

437
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,160
move away from this sort of structure

438
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
and move into what's called

439
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
microservices

440
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,519
so take a look at this the cube

441
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
this is the same cube that was there

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
before it's the same application it does

443
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,519
all of the same things as it was before

444
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
you have this to your end users they

445
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,959
have the same ui they have the same

446
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,320
experience

447
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
the same business logic that we were

448
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
talking about before is there

449
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,440
and data is still being written to the

450
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
same data sources

451
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
but what what you've done however is

452
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
that you've taken that larger

453
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,519
application that single server

454
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,240
application and you've broken it down

455
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
into smaller components

456
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
so what was now once a single

457
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
application host in a single dll hosted

458
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
on a single server

459
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
now becomes a collection of small

460
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
applications

461
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
of small services of micro

462
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
services

463
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
and the reason

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
people are doing this

465
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,839
is that these micro services are

466
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
generally hosted in something called a

467
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,800
container

468
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
i'm not going to get into the details of

469
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
what a container is here now

470
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
but at a high level what it means is

471
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
that they're getting the same isolation

472
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,160
that your vendor wanted to begin with

473
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,759
that your vendor was demanding from you

474
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,880
when they said they want their own

475
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
server

476
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,959
you your application is still opening

477
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,039
within a small environment

478
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,559
it's isolated from everything else

479
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
and you get all those benefits without

480
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
the overhead of another operating system

481
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
another which also requires endpoint

482
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
detection and response agents

483
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,079
event management

484
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
privilege actions management your

485
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
licenses fees are going up and up and up

486
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,559
which is where business users start

487
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,640
caring about this

488
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
backups

489
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
monitoring

490
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
licensing and much more

491
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
so now what was once

492
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
a cube to look great

493
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
this is what your applications start to

494
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,400
look like

495
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,919
now if you're not a technical person and

496
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,520
you're looking at this

497
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
you're probably your first response is

498
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
no thank you i'll take the cube it's

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
better to understand

500
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
and if you're a developer in the room

501
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
that understands microservices

502
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
architecture you're probably thinking

503
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,039
why couldn't i have come up with a

504
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,600
better diagram than this

505
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,039
bear with me

506
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,000
i'm going to answer some of those

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
questions now

508
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
now

509
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
first question that is on everybody's

510
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
mind though is why would you want

511
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
microservices architecture we talked

512
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
about service brawl

513
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
that you get from monolithic

514
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
but in order to understand why people

515
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,720
would want a microservices platform

516
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,799
let's take a look at the greatest system

517
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
architect of all time

518
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
mother nature

519
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,799
because people have a hard time

520
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
conceptualizing what microservice

521
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
actually means

522
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
let's see if we can give an example of

523
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
something that you can refer to every

524
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
day

525
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
tonight look look in the mirror

526
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
you are the oldest and most mature

527
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
marco system architecture ever built

528
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,919
the human body is a great way to

529
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,240
understand how you could take a complex

530
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
thing and break it down into a bunch of

531
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
subsystems you have a nervous system a

532
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
respiratory system

533
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,760
digestive muscular

534
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,400
we all share this same

535
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
collection of subservices

536
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,679
and even though we all share that

537
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,919
it's obvious that this arc

538
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
it's obvious that this architecture is

539
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
very

540
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
versatile and scales

541
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
that means that this doesn't just apply

542
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
to the people that you read about

543
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
netflix google et cetera it also applies

544
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
to the applications at the scale and

545
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,760
size that you're developing

546
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,440
and just like

547
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,640
when the systems break or you need

548
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
something done within one of those

549
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
systems you go see a specialist

550
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
you're seeing a doctor that specializes

551
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
in your area

552
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
whatever it is whatever subsystem is

553
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,400
broken

554
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
the same applies to to developers

555
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
by breaking your big application down

556
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
into microservices you're breaking your

557
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,919
application up into small bits of work

558
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,919
that you can outsource to specialists

559
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
rather than try to find a generalist

560
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
developer that knows absolutely

561
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,760
everything about the product you're

562
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
trying to build you can get a collection

563
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
of small developers to build the

564
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,120
specific components you're trying to

565
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,239
extend your application with

566
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,799
so let's go back now to the original

567
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
diagram here

568
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,679
just like the human body is built up

569
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,280
is a system of microservices

570
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
architecture

571
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
in this diagram each circle

572
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,919
represents

573
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,240
a microservice

574
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
each piece of functionality

575
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
of your product

576
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,640
i'm supposed to bring my little pointer

577
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,919
here but i didn't

578
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
so you're gonna have to bear with me

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
as i try to explain out a few things

580
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,799
just pointing at the screen

581
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
take a look closer at the diagram

582
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,919
it might have looked chaotic before but

583
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,760
you can still see that your idea is

584
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,400
clearly defined the light bulb is very

585
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,720
visible to you

586
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,919
and remember that you're the most

587
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,280
important person when it comes to

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
whatever it is that you're trying to

589
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
build

590
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
and you're looking at this and you say

591
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,520
well that's great thank you very much

592
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,799
for the lesson

593
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
and microservices technology thank you

594
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
very much for all that this is a

595
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,480
security conference what does this have

596
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
to do with security

597
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
and this is where business leaders can

598
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
really take away some really good

599
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
information

600
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,240
each let's focus now on on the outer

601
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
circles

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
each portion of this outer circle of

603
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
each one of these outer circles out

604
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
outer circles sorry

605
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
as a piece of functionality a new piece

606
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
of functionality that you want to add to

607
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
your product

608
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
each of each of these can be developed

609
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
by individual developers different

610
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,799
companies

611
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,960
all of them can contribute to your

612
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
overall idea

613
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,320
which you can snap that functionality

614
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
into your application

615
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
but you can also keep them locked out of

616
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,480
the underlying code the underlying nuts

617
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,039
and bolts that make your unique product

618
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
because of concurrency things are being

619
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
developed faster

620
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,799
and

621
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
you can work

622
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
with vendors that specialize in whatever

623
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,919
small service that you're trying to

624
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,320
create

625
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
and when these companies that you've

626
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
outsourced to leave and they work with

627
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
your competitors

628
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
they're not taking their your idea with

629
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
them

630
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
because they didn't have visibility into

631
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
all the different pieces of

632
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,840
functionality inside of your application

633
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
they built you a specific thing they

634
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
built you a shareholder registered

635
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
management system

636
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
they built you an ai

637
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
engine

638
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,799
that gives you predictive analytics

639
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
they didn't get into the underlying code

640
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
the core piece of your functionality

641
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,559
they didn't take your idea and they're

642
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,840
not going to bring it to someone else

643
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
now while this is the case

644
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
you're still going to be developing on

645
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
some sort of

646
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,679
common framework some sort of common set

647
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,360
of tools

648
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,799
so let's zoom out a bit from your

649
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,919
application

650
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
and take a look at this more

651
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,320
holistically

652
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,720
most when you did the application that

653
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,320
you develop and the underlying micro

654
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,600
services that make up your application

655
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,039
those are running on a common set of

656
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,400
tools like object storage e-signing

657
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,679
maybe some sort of in in-memory database

658
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,720
identity and access management

659
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,440
rather than build all of these things

660
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,919
yourself from scratch you can utilize

661
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
these services that are built by others

662
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
and this is where hybrid cloud

663
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,039
starts to shine

664
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
you can go on to places like amazon

665
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
like azure like ibm cloud and find these

666
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
services for rent if you will

667
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
the problem is is that these are

668
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
traditionally cloud-based

669
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,480
we all know about the environmental

670
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
reasons why in cayman

671
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,080
it's dif it can be difficult cloud can

672
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
sometimes be difficult

673
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,080
with hybrid cloud you can pull these

674
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,679
services these traditionally cloud

675
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,320
services on premise and run them on your

676
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
infrastructure sitting in your data

677
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,000
center or in your office

678
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,520
so now

679
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
you've got these robust systems

680
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
that previously were running in the

681
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,640
cloud that were something that you

682
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
couldn't touch you can do you can pull

683
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,919
down these services through platforms

684
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,120
like openshift and run them on hardware

685
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,799
you can look at in a jurisdiction that

686
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,520
you feel comfortable with

687
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,880
zoom out a little further

688
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
you need

689
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,840
you should have a multi-cloud strategy

690
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,200
we're getting out of the technical now

691
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
we're getting into

692
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
the business side of this

693
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,520
remember security is not just about

694
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
protecting

695
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
a teenage kid trying to hack into your

696
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,919
laptop

697
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,799
or

698
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,679
some geopolitical enemy

699
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,200
it's also about protecting the

700
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,679
continuity of your business

701
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
as you heard clouds go down

702
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,679
cloud prices can change

703
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
things can happen that affect the

704
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,840
availability of your services

705
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
you should never and you should not be

706
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
betting on a single cloud provider for

707
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
those reasons

708
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,679
betting on a single cloud provider is

709
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,200
kind of like getting two internet

710
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
connections into your building

711
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
but having them both come from the same

712
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
internet service provider

713
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
it's just not a good idea

714
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,240
remember

715
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,480
ever these clouds exist

716
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
and every cloud has a niche

717
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,440
there will always be a market for your

718
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
iga

719
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
and president's choice type cloud

720
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
providers

721
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
like aws and azure they do a little bit

722
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
of everything

723
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,120
uh they have a broad product base

724
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
it's more about variety than anything

725
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
else

726
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,919
but as as we talked about your

727
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,400
application is cut up and broken up into

728
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
small services

729
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
you want to be able to take some of your

730
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
micro services and run them on clouds

731
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,720
that have a specialty and a niche that

732
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,799
you need

733
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,200
so if you want to do image processing ai

734
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
inferencing

735
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
predictive analytics

736
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
maybe ibm cloud is a better fit for you

737
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
and you run that one component of your

738
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
application up there

739
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
storage

740
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,200
aws

741
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,760
interoperability azure you've got

742
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
windows it makes a lot of sense

743
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,080
the idea there is that you're not

744
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,320
beholden to anyone

745
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,679
and you need to make sure that the tools

746
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,679
that you have to automate

747
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,080
these things

748
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
can work on every cloud provider

749
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
so going back to the original analogy of

750
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,320
the human body being a microservices

751
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,799
architecture

752
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
if if the human body if all these

753
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
different subsystems are all your

754
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
different micro services

755
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
identity and access management is the

756
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,799
heart of your platform

757
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,240
so what is identity and access

758
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
management

759
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
let's take a look at office 365.

760
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,799
you go to one place you sign in once

761
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,840
right

762
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,159
and then you have access to all of these

763
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,919
different systems and services

764
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,399
that's

765
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,919
one part

766
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,840
of what identity and access management

767
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,240
gives you

768
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
you you should be using

769
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,120
things like open id connect and saml

770
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,559
to help protect not only the

771
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,480
applications that other people build for

772
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,159
you but also the applications that you

773
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,080
build yourself

774
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,840
stop using active directory

775
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,159
to manage your authorization and to your

776
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,399
application active directory is great

777
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,399
for windows not so great for ios and mac

778
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,919
it's not compatible with a sas

779
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,240
architecture

780
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,120
and then

781
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,279
sooner or later active directory becomes

782
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
this boneyard

783
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
of groups a d groups that nobody knows

784
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,480
whether they're still in use what their

785
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
original function were and everybody's

786
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,279
too afraid to delete them because they

787
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,000
don't know what it's going to break

788
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
i could second i could see the it guys

789
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,520
over there

790
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,039
the other thing that you're going to get

791
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,640
out of identity and access management

792
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,720
is not is access management and review

793
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
so let's take a look at the at the ring

794
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,919
here

795
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,440
at the top

796
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,279
somebody needs access to a system on

797
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,919
your in your computer or your network

798
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
they call the help desk which is the

799
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
green

800
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
help desk contacts the application owner

801
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,679
so let's say somebody wants access to

802
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
the finance system they speak to the

803
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,159
finance person

804
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
finance person says yes they can have

805
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
access they then

806
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,720
help desk gives the access and that's

807
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
the end of that

808
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,399
then sometime in the pa sometime in the

809
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
future a few months later somebody

810
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,880
questions

811
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
you know why here's all these these

812
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,159
people that have access to all these

813
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,600
different systems

814
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,360
there's an inquiry that goes into why

815
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,000
the person was given access to it

816
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
and then the application owner is

817
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
eventually contacted and there's some

818
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,480
sort of

819
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
determination that the access is no

820
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
longer required

821
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,120
the problems with this this setup here

822
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
is that help desk is an unnecessary

823
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
middleman

824
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,600
because all they're doing is seeking

825
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
authorization from someone else

826
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
and what's also not covered in this

827
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
is that

828
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,279
using your current flow which is

829
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,840
probably active

830
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,039
directory the review part is not

831
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,480
mandated

832
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
it's a voluntary process that you hope

833
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
people go through

834
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
let's take a look at what happens when

835
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
you use an identity and access

836
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,399
management platform

837
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
instead of people contacting the help

838
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,240
desk they're going to their launch pad

839
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
and they've got a list of applications

840
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,760
they're available that they get by

841
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,520
default

842
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,279
and of course if you don't see something

843
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,200
that you need access but you need access

844
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
to let's say uh

845
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,159
docusign in this example

846
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,679
the requester

847
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,360
fills out

848
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
an access request along with the

849
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
justification and hit submit and it goes

850
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,520
to the application owner directly

851
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
that's the business use user that is in

852
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
charge so take docusign out of that and

853
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
let's put in

854
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,039
something else let's say it's your

855
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,640
register management system let's say

856
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
it's your finance system

857
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,440
let's say it's ansible tower whatever it

858
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
is

859
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,039
that application owner approves it

860
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,880
help desk is no longer involved your

861
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,080
paper trail is still intact and you get

862
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,840
to the end a lot quicker

863
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
what also comes with this

864
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
is that you've got the review part built

865
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
in

866
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,640
access management platforms are smart

867
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,519
enough to identify outliers

868
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,840
where it can find where a person in your

869
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,399
company has a level of elevated access

870
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,960
much higher than all their peers

871
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
and help highlight that

872
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,080
to people in charge so that they can

873
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
take a look at that

874
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,600
and these highlights don't just go

875
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
to i.t

876
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
they can go to the audit department

877
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,120
inside of your organization so you have

878
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
a separation so that everything's not

879
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
beholden on i t to do these things

880
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,600
and

881
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,840
also the audit department can kick off

882
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
what are called recertification

883
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
campaigns where they're sending out

884
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
emails to all the application owners and

885
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,279
asking the application owners

886
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
to confirm that that person still needs

887
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,919
access to whatever platform they allowed

888
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,440
and then and during that review the

889
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
application order can revoke the

890
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,200
permission all of this being done

891
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
without going on to your it team all of

892
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
this being done independent

893
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,000
and best of all

894
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,640
this access review could also be

895
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
to review access of people in your it

896
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
department because

897
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,279
lingered access elevated access also

898
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,799
happens with those people as well

899
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,799
let's take a look at what this now does

900
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,240
what was once a ring that involved

901
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
i think it was about eight or nine steps

902
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,480
now becomes a four-step process number

903
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
one the access is submitted by the

904
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,120
requester

905
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,799
the application owner number two

906
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,640
approves it

907
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
number three somebody in audit rit kicks

908
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,039
off a recertification campaign and

909
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,720
number four that access is no longer

910
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,519
required it's revoked this is all being

911
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,600
done by non-technical people

912
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,279
all being done

913
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
on

914
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,120
on a centralized platform with these

915
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,679
sort of things built into it

916
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,519
and what's also good

917
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,039
is that you can also run these sort of

918
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
things on your own

919
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,159
i.t department as well

920
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,919
so why should you care

921
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,279
what does this matter what does this

922
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,399
have to do with security because this

923
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,679
sounds more like operations than

924
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,320
anything else

925
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,480
most of the hacks

926
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
that people talk about that you see in

927
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
the news

928
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,440
somebody's password was cracked one of

929
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
your staff his password has been cracked

930
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
and hackers they're going to take the

931
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,039
path of least resistance as much as

932
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,240
possible

933
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,159
so if you have

934
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
and when that happens

935
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
your best layer of defense

936
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,200
are things like the conditional access

937
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
policies that you get through

938
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,919
identity and access management platforms

939
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
and good governance and of access of

940
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,519
your systems

941
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,519
if people are not if they're given

942
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
elevated access for only exactly as long

943
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,040
as they need it

944
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
then you're exposed exposure to to other

945
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
people bad actors getting that

946
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,839
information is only exposed for exactly

947
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,199
as long as that person needed to do

948
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,639
their job

949
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
if everybody's access sticks with their

950
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,079
default stuff

951
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
then you can help manage your risk to a

952
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,679
data exposure a lot better through good

953
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,159
governance

954
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,000
another thing to remember is don't

955
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,560
forget about your customer portals

956
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,399
access review

957
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,679
okay i'll give it to you not applicable

958
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,639
uh

959
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,719
access request okay i'll give you that

960
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,839
too that's also not applicable but what

961
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,918
is is the actual technology that people

962
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,440
use whenever they're signing into your

963
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
pot your your portals

964
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,359
in almost all cases and cayman portals

965
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
are built by somebody else it's some

966
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
service that you've

967
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
some subscription that you signed up to

968
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
you found a vendor that vendor has

969
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
everything baked in they've got

970
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,960
authentication already covered

971
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,040
think about and now you've deployed your

972
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
portal it's off it's doing great you've

973
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
got lots of people on it

974
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,440
but stop and think about what you've

975
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
done

976
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,599
all of your users are now in someone

977
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,839
else's database using somebody else's

978
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,560
proprietary authentication

979
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
how are you going to move those users to

980
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
someone just to another platform

981
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,240
they don't belong to you anymore

982
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,839
basically

983
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,520
you think you're going to find a vendor

984
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
that's going to make it easy for you

985
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
to transition users off off of their

986
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,960
system now

987
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,160
now instead what you should be taking a

988
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
look at

989
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
is what's called consumer identity and

990
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,560
access management platform

991
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,040
what this allows you now

992
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
is the ability to get people signed into

993
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
your platform and it creates a

994
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
separation between the authentication

995
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,839
part

996
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,800
and the service that they're using

997
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
so

998
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
at an end result

999
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,320
from your end result is that

1000
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
your users will go to your portal

1001
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
they'll get redirected to a sign-in page

1002
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
they sign in

1003
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,240
they'll get tech they get taken back to

1004
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
your home page of your portal

1005
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,240
and they're utilizing your service

1006
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,599
they've got access to everything that

1007
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,800
you've wanted them to have access to

1008
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
if you lend remembering our

1009
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
microservices structure right an

1010
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
application is not any one thing it's

1011
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
not any one server it's not any one

1012
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
service

1013
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
if you have a portal that does 99 of

1014
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
what you want but you want to add

1015
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
that extra one percent of functionality

1016
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,839
through some other

1017
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,160
maybe custom development maybe some oth

1018
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,079
some other vendors portal to supplement

1019
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,280
the services that you need of the

1020
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
primary one

1021
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,359
they can also use your consumer and

1022
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,599
identity access management platform

1023
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
so just like in office 365 you go to

1024
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,760
portal.office.com

1025
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,119
you sign in

1026
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,400
next step you need to get into

1027
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,960
sharepoint you click sharepoint that is

1028
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,599
a totally different service platform

1029
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,680
vendor data center in a different

1030
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
geographic place in the world

1031
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,119
but

1032
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
i bet you anybody that was in this room

1033
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,720
that isn't a software developer you

1034
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,400
probably wouldn't have known

1035
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,160
a couple redirects happen you're taken

1036
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,520
in that's what's going to happen with

1037
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
your customers

1038
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,040
and what it means for you as a business

1039
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,359
owner is that if you have a you have a

1040
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,800
portal that you're very proud of that

1041
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,240
you've done really well on that you've

1042
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
got good customer buy-in and you want to

1043
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,599
later move to another platform that's a

1044
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,359
little bit better that offers a little

1045
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,520
better services or maybe

1046
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,359
the platform you're on right now have

1047
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,560
kind of ended up in the news and you

1048
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,000
want to distance yourself from that

1049
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,480
you can now move to another platform

1050
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
because the vendors that you select use

1051
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,960
the technologies i mentioned before open

1052
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
id connect saml

1053
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
write these things down

1054
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
make sure that you include it that is

1055
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,160
something for business leaders as well

1056
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
open id connect saml you should be

1057
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
asking your vendors whenever they're

1058
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
talking to them do you support this

1059
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,079
because this is a way that you can avoid

1060
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,920
yourself getting locked in with a

1061
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,000
different developer with a vendor

1062
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
because i tell you something if your

1063
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,680
plan is dear customer i've moved to a

1064
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
different platform i need you to

1065
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
re-register this is what you're going to

1066
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,960
get

1067
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,079
now

1068
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,520
let's let's take a break from that and

1069
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,200
let's go on to automation

1070
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,200
automation's going to be a key part of

1071
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,760
allowing you to

1072
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,640
better your security posture in general

1073
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,359
you should try to do as much automation

1074
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,640
as possible

1075
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
automate your internal tasks

1076
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,440
external provisioning de-provisioning

1077
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,040
and change management

1078
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,520
and you need to make sure that you don't

1079
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,359
pick a technology stack that is

1080
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,078
dependent on any single cloud provider

1081
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,920
you're not in a good position if you're

1082
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
on azure and you're relying on all the

1083
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,520
different automation features that exist

1084
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,640
at asher and azure alone

1085
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,319
what happens if you need to leave azure

1086
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
what happens

1087
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
if

1088
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,880
you are purchased by someone else and

1089
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,800
they're on aws where is all that

1090
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,560
automation gone where has that gotten

1091
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,640
you

1092
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,240
none of these companies are beholden to

1093
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,560
you so don't be beholden to them

1094
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
they're great companies

1095
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
but use the technology stacks that make

1096
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,720
sense for you spread your application

1097
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,440
out

1098
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,640
and build up an automation

1099
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,599
using frameworks that are not beholden

1100
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,200
to anyone

1101
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,359
these are things like ansible

1102
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,880
terraform openshift

1103
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,119
don't use technology stacks that only

1104
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,720
work with a single provider

1105
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,079
and as far as

1106
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,839
the other thing to consider here and

1107
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,359
this might seem like a pretty radical

1108
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,560
idea

1109
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
change management

1110
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
so think about a ransomware attack

1111
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
everything's gone

1112
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
you're done

1113
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,760
you need to rebuild your environment

1114
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,119
everyone here thinks they already have

1115
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,800
the answer to that just go back just go

1116
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
to your backups

1117
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,760
most hacks ransomware hacks

1118
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,599
people don't don't

1119
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,280
uh set off the bomb as soon as they get

1120
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
through your doors

1121
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,079
instead what they're doing is they leave

1122
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,680
a breadcrumb

1123
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,599
a breadcrumb of vulnerabilities all

1124
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,920
around your network and then tackle you

1125
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,599
and go after you at a time that makes

1126
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,680
most sense for them

1127
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
and that means

1128
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
that those vulnerabilities might be in

1129
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,880
your backups

1130
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,319
because some hackers can be pretty

1131
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,000
patient

1132
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,599
i've heard stories

1133
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,880
about

1134
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,640
hackers encrypting backups

1135
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,119
so you meanwhile you thought

1136
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,280
wow okay i'm still protected i'm backing

1137
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,920
up my systems often

1138
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
but when you go to restore your systems

1139
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,079
you're then realizing your backups are

1140
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,119
encrypted and you can't utilize them

1141
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,200
because i i will

1142
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
cayman's no different than anywhere else

1143
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,640
in the world you're probably not looking

1144
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,040
at or using or checking your backups

1145
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
until you need to

1146
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,040
and then even if that's not the case for

1147
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
you there's always the chance that

1148
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,599
sleeping inside of that that backup is

1149
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,119
that same vulnerability that puts you in

1150
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,119
the bad spot to begin with

1151
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,880
so all you're all you're doing is

1152
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,319
setting yourself up for a replay

1153
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,800
last but not least

1154
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,040
is that you need a secret vault

1155
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
privilege access management is something

1156
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,800
is a buzzword that's going around cayman

1157
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,040
most people have an idea of it

1158
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
uh it's you know you're rotating the

1159
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
passwords

1160
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
okay and you're rotating the passwords

1161
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,560
on these are supposed to be icons i

1162
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
noticed using a custom font that's not a

1163
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,920
good idea maybe i'll go images next time

1164
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,599
you've you're probably rotating the

1165
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,920
password on your local server

1166
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
you're rotating the passwords on your

1167
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
linux environments maybe you're doing

1168
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,040
your certificates as well

1169
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,280
your client ids and and client secrets

1170
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
etc

1171
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,000
your access tokens refresh tokens

1172
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
but are you re are you rotating the

1173
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
passwords on your data stores

1174
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,839
because that's what hackers want access

1175
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,839
once they get pat once a hacker gets

1176
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,280
past your first line of defense they're

1177
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,720
going for your data

1178
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,760
because that's where your money is

1179
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
that's where your value is

1180
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,400
so you should be using things to rotate

1181
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,200
the passwords on your database servers

1182
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
on your ftp servers

1183
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,079
on your file shares etc

1184
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,760
so that when your application is

1185
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,440
accessing

1186
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
data from your database it's using the

1187
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,000
latest password available that was given

1188
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,520
to that server

1189
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
rather than using a common password that

1190
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
not only you know but every developer

1191
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,119
that used to work for your company knows

1192
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
as well

1193
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,760
so what do i do my wife warned me that i

1194
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,599
should change that photo i when i asked

1195
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,960
her why she said it's because he looks

1196
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,119
better than me

1197
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,319
i told her that it doesn't help me

1198
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,599
because it doesn't matter what photo i

1199
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,880
put up there it's probably always going

1200
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,359
to be the case

1201
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,680
i help i help companies create

1202
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,359
development strategies includes

1203
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,640
multi-cloud

1204
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,160
i'm generally talking to people about

1205
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,680
avoiding vendor lock-in which is what

1206
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,280
you need to do this is what you should

1207
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,800
write down

1208
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,160
and automating anything and everything

1209
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,680
the use of the sort of strategy it

1210
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
doesn't if you take

1211
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
the what do i do part out of this slide

1212
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,440
and you just look at the bullet points

1213
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,119
these are the things that you need that

1214
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,480
i've tried and you should try to take

1215
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,760
away from this

1216
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,720
talk

1217
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,119
is to help you better position your

1218
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,640
company it doesn't matter who does it

1219
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,839
for you

1220
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,200
these are the things that you should do

1221
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,880
that will help increase your security

1222
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
posture

1223
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,560
right multi-cloud

1224
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,960
avoid vendor lock-in

1225
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,560
automate as much as you can because

1226
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,640
that's going to help you come back

1227
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
and then break and then uh you know

1228
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,160
developing try to your best to break

1229
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,680
down the barriers between your decision

1230
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,440
makers infrastructure and developers

1231
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,920
thank you very much for your time um

1232
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,640
does anybody have any questions

1233
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,839
okay well you're not all sleeping so

1234
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,400
that's a good thing

1235
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,880
sure

1236
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,160
you did say that we need to diversify

1237
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,640
the our cloud strategy

1238
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
but how do you balance that with um

1239
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,319
getting skill sets with persons who are

1240
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,400
exposed to all these different

1241
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
technologies

1242
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,599
well

1243
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,400
it's a balancing act there right

1244
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,040
first of all diversifying your cloud

1245
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
strategy can mean using services that

1246
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
are common to all clouds like object

1247
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
storage yeah blob storage it doesn't

1248
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,160
matter what cloud it is it all works the

1249
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,560
same yeah

1250
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,880
but when it comes to the examples i gave

1251
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,960
where you're saying well you need ai

1252
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,480
which is a specialty of one cloud

1253
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,359
provider over another yeah

1254
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,599
your introduction to that is probably

1255
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,680
going to involve a specialist

1256
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,720
yeah

1257
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,319
so your specialist can help you through

1258
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,560
that

1259
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,520
but at the same time remember that

1260
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,200
i view and i think would be good for you

1261
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,040
to view i view the cloud as a stock

1262
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,079
market

1263
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,760
it's the place that i go and i shop for

1264
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,200
the best price based on what i need

1265
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,040
so if i have an application a large

1266
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
application and it needs

1267
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
artificial intelligence

1268
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,440
sql backend

1269
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,920
i need some blob storage

1270
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,359
and a number of other different

1271
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,640
technologies

1272
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,480
i'm going to surf the cloud for whatever

1273
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,720
price that makes sense and if that means

1274
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
spreading it across four different

1275
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,359
clouds it doesn't matter to me because

1276
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,680
there is a commonality between these

1277
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,960
services on the different clouds they

1278
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
all sell different stuff

1279
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,000
but you need to go to the one that

1280
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
specializes and the best price for

1281
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,680
whatever small service you need yeah

1282
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,480
anybody else

1283
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,079
all right well thank you very much and

1284
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,050
take care

1285
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:39,459
[Applause]

1286
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,040
you
