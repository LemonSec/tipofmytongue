those that that are still here

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,719
the next gentleman coming to stage won't

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,200
be disappointing um

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,519

i spent some time with len last night

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,680
so i'm going to make sure i get this

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,679
right for reasons that i'm sure all of

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
you will get to learn as he goes through

14

hacker and learned most of his skills

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
by practical application

34

administration architecture coding and

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
the past six years focusing on

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
information security from an attacker's

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
perspective

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,759

he has seven microchips under his skin

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,360
that are used as offensive cyber tools

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
len has demonstrated the hacking

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
abilities of augmented humans and

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,200
provides information for security

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
professionals to adapt to this new

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
threat landscape

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
he also actively participates in the

51

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,799
communities in texas the autism society

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
and many others ladies and gentlemen

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
help me welcome and to the stage

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,280
how you all doing

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
i like that woozer woozer happy

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
uh as

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
was just said my name is len no

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
pronounced no opposite of yes and if you

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
ask my parents i was named very very

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
appropriately because i've heard len no

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,239
no no

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,840
pretty much my whole damn life

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,400
so

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
this is probably going to be one of the

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
more out there talks

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
but everything that you are going to see

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
today is real

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,760
so

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,640
this

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
talk was originally done last year with

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,959
some mild modifications at the rsa

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,400
conference

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,959
but due to the fact that kovid kind of

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
repressed all of us from being able to

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,159
get out in the world and actually share

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
this information i'd like to thank

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
besides cayman for giving me the

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
opportunity to come here and present

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
so let's go ahead and get started

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
as i said my name is len noe

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
i am currently a technical evangelist

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
and white hat for cyberark software i've

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
been with cyberark for nine years

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
uh i've been breaking into computers

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
since the commodore 64 days and

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,080
you know to be honest there's really not

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
much else i'm really good at

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
um yes that is a qr code yes it is safe

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
if i was actually trying to hack you

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
this would probably be a very very

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
career limiting move at a large event

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,319
like this

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,760
the only thing that that qr code is

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,799
going to give you is basically my

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
contact information that you see right

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
there

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
so

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,120
i'm going to start this chat by asking

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
everybody here a simple question

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
what do cyborgs look like

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
you know i have no doubt that in in the

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
heads of everybody out here maybe you're

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
thinking darth vader maybe you're

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
thinking a terminator but the truth is

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
you might actually be friends with a

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,840
cyborg and you don't even know it

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,799
yet these are my hands

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,840
as you can see from the x-ray here i

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
have multiple implants in my hands and

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
this x-ray is actually a little bit

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
older i actually have quite a few more

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,760
since the time this was actually done

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
but i'm going to explain what i

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
currently have and i'll tell you guys a

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
little bit more about what i'm doing on

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
my roadmap to actually become more than

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,040
human

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
so i'm going to start off i have what is

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
called a flex next this is a flexible

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
membrane rfid and nfc chip with a very

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
large coiled antenna

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
this allows me to program the chip to

124
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
anything that would fall under either

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,919
low frequency rfid or high frequency nfc

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
i have a next chip this one as you can

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
see is a different form factor this was

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
actually the very first implant that i

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
ever got

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,199
and the

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
before i get the questions later yes all

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,960
of my implants were actually implanted

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
in my body for the purposes of offensive

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
security the

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
next chip as it was the first implant i

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,960
ever got

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
it i discovered that i just didn't have

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
enough distance

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
in order to be able to perform you know

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,800
any type of exfiltration or compromise

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
of a mobile device and still make it

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
look like it was a normal

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
you know handling of a cell phone

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
uh these two chips are essentially

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
identical i use the very large one for

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
defensive purposes the small one

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
actually currently is the

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
key to unlock my my office at home keeps

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
my wife and my kids out of my office

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
i have a flex m1 magic this is a myfair

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
classic with the rewritable 1k

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
chip so anybody that's using a myfair

153
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
classic i can actually write that

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
information directly down onto one of

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
the implants in my hands and for the

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
record here's to the holiday inn i

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
already downloaded your my favorite your

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
my fair door card and it's actually

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
already on my hand this is what happens

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
when i get bored

161
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
i have a vivoki spark 2. this is

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
actually a cryptobionic chip

163
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
that actually has a companion

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
application on my phone as i and is

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
actually part of a triple factor

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
authentication to get into my crypto

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
wallet

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
since the time of these

169
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
where these x-rays were taken i actually

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
have what is a flex e-m in my wrist

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,319
right here

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
this actually allows me the ability to

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
emulate

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
uh indala prox pyramid diamond in terms

175
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
of physical authentication protocols i

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
also have a

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
uh

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
titan biomagnet in my my hand

179
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,720
you know and this is where i like to do

180
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
this little trick here if nobody's ever

181
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
seen it so i can actually

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
pick up metal objects with my pinky

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
you know it makes for a really cool bar

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
trick but that's not what it was for

185
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
this actually gives me the ability to

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
feel electromagnetic currents and

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
electromagnetic fields

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
you know and i get the questions all the

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
time well what does that do for you lynn

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
i'm a pen tester so i also do physical

191
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
pen testing i i'm a a very avid lock

192
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,160
picker but let's talk about your your

193
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
warehouses

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
what type of locks are typically used in

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,880
warehouses and storage

196
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
magnetic locks

197
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
so that allows me on the outside i can

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
actually run my hands over the outside

199
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
of your building and i can find the

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
electrical pathways to where that

201
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,919
electric lock are which gives me better

202
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
opportunities especially if it's an

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
invasive pen test that i can actually

204
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,840
shim your magnetic locks

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
currently sitting at home right now i

206
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
actually have two more implants that i'm

207
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
just waiting to actually be put in

208
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
i have a chip called the wallet more

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
this actually allows me the ability to

210
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
do tap to pay just like android wallet

211
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
apple pay or your nfc credit cards

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,000
i have an hid implant

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
that will allow me to

214
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
impersonate hid one two and three for

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
physical access cards and i have an nfc

216
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
des fire two that i'm waiting on

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
delivery

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,479
and then i'll just go ahead and get all

219
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,000
three of those implanted at once this

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
will actually give me higher nfc

221
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
capabilities up to and including using

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
it as part of a multi-factor

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
authentication on my computer

224
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,479
so i am extremely heavily implanted

225
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
so as i said augmented humans are not

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
science fiction we're science fact

227
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
we're here and we're not going anywhere

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
and as the technology continues to

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
evolve

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
so will

231
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,400
we

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
so i've broken this talk today up into

233
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
three separate parts

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
uh we're going to start off with a

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
little bit of history on the transhuman

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
movement where we got our starts and

237
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
then we're going to move into today and

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,519
then what the future holds for augmented

239
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
humans and security

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
around people like myself

241
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,519
so when we talk about implant technology

242
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
you know this is not a very long

243
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
timeline

244
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
the first cardiac pacemaker was actually

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,080
installed in buffalo new york in 1952

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
and it was not a completely implanted

247
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,680
device

248
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
the power for the the pacemaker actually

249
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
had leads coming out of the vic the

250
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
subject's chest and was connected to a

251
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
power external power supply that was

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
actually the size of an old table radio

253
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,800
the first implanted electric pacemaker

254
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,959
happened in 1958

255
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,200
and this was actually done inside of a

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,399
pig

257
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
the first human implant

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
wasn't until 1960.

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,640
so i mean if you take a look we're

260
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
talking 70 years ago this is not a very

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
long timeline

262
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
uh 1964 gave us the first smart

263
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
pacemaker this was a device that

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,760
actually took bio feedback from the body

265
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
and was able to actually make

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
adjustments to its protocols based on

267
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,720
that feedback

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,120
through the 70s and 80s there was some

269
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
some things that came out but nothing

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
really major

271
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
we didn't really start seeing a lot of

272
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
improvement in the biotechnology for

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
implants until the mid 90s to the 2000s

274
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
where we started seeing smart

275
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
prosthetics

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
all the way up to where we have

277
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
artificial intelligence now

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
you know one of the things that's not on

279
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,680
this list but there was actually a

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,839
surgery done a couple of months ago

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,880
uh where there was a new microcontroller

282
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
implant that was actually put on a

283
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
paralyzed man's

284
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
spinal cord

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
and

286
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
he actually has some ambulatory movement

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
now i mean he's not jumping up and

288
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
dancing and all but i mean

289
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
this is some major scientific biomedical

290
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
breakthroughs and this is where we are

291
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
today

292
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,320
so when we talk about today

293
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
what is the biohacker

294
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,519
all about today

295
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
you know

296
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
if you take a look at us we're called

297
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
all kinds of different things biohackers

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
transhumans grinders i was even called

299
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
wet works a wetwork when i was in

300
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
sweden about two weeks ago

301
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
you know essentially

302
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,560
we are

303
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
the product of

304
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,279
a

305
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
gentleman by the name of julian huxley

306
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
who coined the term transhuman back in

307
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,399
1957 and he actually started a movement

308
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
and the transhuman movement is a social

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,440
and philosophical you know

310
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
movement dedicated

311
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,360
to basically taking the human being

312
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
beyond the physical form that we were

313
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
born into

314
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
you know so this

315
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
can be very confusing sometimes because

316
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,000
i am a voluntary trans human i chose to

317
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
do this to myself i'm actually a very

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
large guinea pig and i know it

319
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
but if we take a look at the medical

320
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,839
industry we have people with pacemakers

321
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
pain stem

322
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,399
pain management devices we have people

323
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
with insulin pumps

324
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
all of these people would be considered

325
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
transhuman under julian huxley's

326
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
definition these are people whose lives

327
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,560
are either extended enhanced or

328
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,000
saved through the use of technology

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,560
so

330
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
the question i always get is where do we

331
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
find implants

332
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
let's be honest the same place we find

333
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
everything else the internet

334
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
if you're in the european

335
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
you know

336
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
there's a company called casec kscck

337
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,760
if you're in the americas they're the

338
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
big manufacturers of a company called

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,079

340
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,440
washington

341
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,279
and when we talk about implants you know

342
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
what kind of implants are there

343
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
we have magnets both

344
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,200
lifting as well as biosensing

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
and when i talk about biosensing this

346
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
actually does exactly what it sounds

347
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
like so this this gives me that

348
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
basically the spiderman spidey sense

349
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
so i if i get too close to a magnet even

350
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
a speaker i'll feel it in my hand

351
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
you know believe it or not the one thing

352
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,079
that triggers it more than anything else

353
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
is my my uh can opener back at home

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
you know one of those big can openers

355
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
you pluck you know my wife

356
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
actually you know opens a can i can be

357
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
at least three to four feet away from

358
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
her and i can feel

359
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
the

360
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
energy that's in the field that's coming

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,839
off of that

362
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
but we have lifting magnets

363
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,079
personally i don't see there's a lot of

364
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,160
use case to these except you if you want

365
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
to go to the bar and you know

366
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
try and get some free drinks but hey to

367
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,839
each of their own

368
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
we have nfc

369
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
and what you see here this is a flexible

370
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
membrane implant

371
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
so as you can see from the top of this

372
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
we have the chip and then everything

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,360
below that is the antenna

374
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
we have rfid

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
we have bio glass encapsulation

376
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
so what you see on the left is

377
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
essentially the same thing as on the

378
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
right but the difference is those bio

379
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
glass encapsulated chips are about the

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
size of a grain or long range uh long

381
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
grain rice

382
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,000
so

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,399
the entire antenna is contained within

384
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,880
that little glass cylinder so as a

385
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
result of that your your distance for

386
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
reed becomes much much smaller

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,880
and you know the cayman island you guys

388
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
seem like a bunch of party animals so if

389
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
you like it we even have leds

390
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
you know if you want to go clubbing at

391
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
night one glow stick in this hand hold

392
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
your phone in this hand the nfc reader

393
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
actually starts lighting up your hand

394
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
and you can blink

395
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
you know hey to each their own

396
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,040
personally i'm not into that but

397
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
i don't i don't begrudge anybody for

398
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,399
going out and partying on a friday night

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
what can i say

400
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
so

401
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,440
when we talk about use cases

402
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
this is what people expected these chips

403
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,199
to be used for

404
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,279
you know there's a an implant that if

405
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
you drive like a tesla model 3 we can

406
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
take the valet

407
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,880
uh

408
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,399
the valet option

409
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
which is a subset of the original key

410
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
that's used to actually start your car

411
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
you can write that to an implant chip so

412
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
you can potentially walk in jump in your

413
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,279
car don't have to worry about your keys

414
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,240
and you can drive off no big deal

415
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,399
we have fob replacements this is what

416
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
most commercial grade implants are used

417
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
for

418
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
if you're a member of a gym maybe you

419
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,720
have a garage

420
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
shared type of services where you they

421
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
give you some type of a puck

422
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
you can actually put these down into an

423
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
implant and actually go ahead go about

424
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,320
your business that's kind of what they

425
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
were originally invented for

426
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,399
membership tokens like i said gyms you

427
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
know maybe you're in an apartment

428
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
complex and you have to be able to scan

429
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,839
into your in the front door these are

430
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
normal use cases

431
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
all the way up to and including

432
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
contactless payments

433
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,519
with the wallet more chip that was

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
released in the uk

435
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
we now have the ability to do tap to pay

436
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
just like i said with it's the same

437
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
technologies in any nfc based credit

438
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
card android wallet or apple pay

439
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,800
that's at home

440
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,759
can't wait to get that one installed

441
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,240
you know but unfortunately not all of us

442
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
are friendly

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,880
you know this introduces a new attack

444
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
vector the human being you know when it

445
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,839
comes to you know all of the people that

446
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,680
have spoken before me today i agree with

447
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
every single thing that they've said

448
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,079
you know and even to cat's point you

449
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,920
know in threat modeling

450
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
you know we're used to the normal attack

451
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,279
vectors you know usb drives phishing

452
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,120
emails spear phishing everybody's

453
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
familiar with these

454
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
but how do you deal with somebody that

455
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
could potentially have an entire linux

456
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,959
system

457
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,120
inside their body doing unattended low

458
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
energy bluetooth scans or metasploit

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
auto pwn

460
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
and the truth is you can't find us

461
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
i can walk right through metal detectors

462
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
i fly through international airports you

463
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,079
will not find me

464
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
the only way that you can detect on

465
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
these is with frequency analyzers and

466
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,040
you have to start actually looking for

467
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,079
the frequencies of the individual chips

468
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,759
and you have better have a wide enough a

469
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
big enough feel energy field for me to

470
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
be able to be detected

471
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,399
we're going to talk about that as we go

472
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,920
along

473
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
so

474
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
this is a peg leg

475
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
this is actually what i'm working on

476
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
getting done next

477
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,440
the only difference is i'm not actually

478
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,519
using a raspberry pi zero w i'm working

479
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,519
with a gentleman from the dallas hackers

480
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
association who's a kicad

481
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
designer and we're actually building a

482
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,799
single board processing computer

483
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,880
with multiple wi-fi

484
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
for the sole purposes

485
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,319
of

486
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,599
implanting it in my my leg

487
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
and as you can see we have a wireless

488
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,799
power receiver on this and the reason

489
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,640
being is because and this is the main

490
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,359
problem with all implants currently on a

491
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,319
commercial scale there is no internal

492
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
power

493
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,079
all of the chips that i have currently

494
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,760
implanted in my body they get their

495
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
power from the receiver

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
you know just like any nfc chip

497
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
so this is both good and bad

498
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
but when it comes to the peg leg what

499
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,320
we've done is we've actually put an

500
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
indirect power receiver on it with no

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
battery so it's going to basically once

502
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
it's implanted in my leg

503
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
i take an external battery with rapid

504
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,320
charging capabilities put it into my

505
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
pocket it powers the device i can access

506
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
that device through either ssh or https

507
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,400
through the onboard applications

508
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
i can stand next to you and do low

509
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
energy bluetooth scans i can try and

510
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,240
auto pone your anything that it can find

511
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
i'm also looking at actually having

512
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
a slice down my leg and running copper

513
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
wire between my thigh almost all the way

514
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,960
to my ankle to act as an antenna

515
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640
so yeah i'm a little bit out there

516
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,559
you know when it comes to the peg legs

517
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,200
and you know this was a grass

518
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
grassroots movement and there is no idea

519
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
how many of these things are out there

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
i know for a fact that i i know two guys

521
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
that actually have done this particular

522
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
implant

523
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
but

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
the issue comes into the encapsulation

525
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,799
because this is a raspberry pi zero w

526
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
they're using two part epoxy to try and

527
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
do their bio encapsulation

528
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,559
and as such

529
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,640
it's not safe

530
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
i know one guy who wound up with with

531
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
heavy metal poisoning because some of

532
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,360
the the epoxy didn't seal correctly and

533
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
some of the heavy metals on the circuit

534
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
boards actually leached into his blood

535
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
system had to have emergency removal

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
surgery so that's why i'm actually

537
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,280
working in conjunction with

538
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,080
dangerousthings.com out of seattle and

539
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
they're the ones that are doing my bio

540
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
encapsulation on mine

541
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
but the fact that there's at least one

542
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,280
individual out there that has these

543
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
types of devices embedded within their

544
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
body should be more than enough to

545
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,039
actually cause you know cisos and

546
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
security admins to at least stop and

547
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
take notice

548
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,240
wrong button

549
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,120
so

550
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,679
let's get into the fun stuff

551
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
we're gonna i told everybody that i'm

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,360
gonna actually demonstrate three

553
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
separate attacks today utilizing the

554
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
implants in my hands

555
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,799
so the first one we're going to show

556
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,120
isn't an attack that i've lovingly named

557
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,039
handshake

558
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,240
uh this is a physical access attack

559
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,120
this

560
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
uh would be around your access control

561
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
inventory your keyless entries on your

562
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,320
your physical locations

563
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
so when i talk about cloning cards this

564
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
is not something new

565
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
the ability to clone a an access badge

566
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
has been around for over 15 years

567
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
the difference between what i'm doing

568
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
and what has been done before me

569
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
is the fact that before if you get

570
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,720
caught in a restricted location

571
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,600
there is going to always be some type of

572
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
card a prox mark you're going to have

573
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,559
something on you that you could use as

574
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
an indication of compromise

575
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
when i write these down to my implants i

576
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
can leave my programmer out in the car

577
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,679
and if i get caught

578
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,280
you can call the police on me i don't

579
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
care

580
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
you know they can search me they can go

581
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
through my pockets there's no other card

582
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,159
there's no

583
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
electronic devices and from a blue team

584
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
or a digital forensics and incident

585
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
response perspective you're going to

586
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
play hell trying to figure out how the

587
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
hell i got in there

588
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,159
so with that can i queue up

589
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,720
video number one please

590
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
and i'm going to go through this in real

591
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
time with you guys

592
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
so we're going to start off i'm going to

593
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
open up my proxmart chameleon mini

594
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
software

595
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
yes that's my real id and yes i look

596
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
like every hacker clip art that you've

597
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,280
ever seen in your life

598
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
and the first thing we're going to

599
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,080
notice is i grab a new uid for a tag

600
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
so i'm going to go ahead and just make

601
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
sure that we know what's what i'm going

602
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,559
to name this lens id

603
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,679
so we're going to go lens id

604
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,799
now i'm going to go ahead and let's get

605
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,159
a baseline so let's scan the the implant

606
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
in my hand

607
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,880
so we go ahead we click the button we

608
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,440
receive a new uid

609
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
we're going to name this one implant

610
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,960
and if anybody wants to see this kind of

611
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
thing hit me up after i've actually got

612
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
my programmer in the other room

613
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
so at this point just to keep everything

614
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
straight we're going to name this

615
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,080
implant

616
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
so as you if you noticed the only thing

617
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
that was different was sector zero line

618
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,520
a

619
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
so at this point

620
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
if i'm part of any type of hackers

621
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
collective i can load this stuff up into

622
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
google drive and i can share your data

623
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,559
anywhere

624
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,000
but that's not necessarily what i want

625
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,360
to do

626
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,159
so

627
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,600
right out of the box i'm using a tool

628
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
called the myfair classic tool i'm going

629
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
to import those two dump files and then

630
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,480
we're going to run a diff command

631
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,120
against them

632
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
you know keep in mind that if i'm part

633
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,559
of a larger hacking group

634
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
i can share these with you know other

635
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
people and now multiple people have

636
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,679
access to your physical locations

637
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,240
so we import both of those

638
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,679
and we're going to go ahead and run a

639
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,200
diff we're going to select the implant

640
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
as the first option and my id is the

641
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,360
second and you'll see that everything is

642
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,320
identical except for sector 0 line a

643
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
so anybody want to guess what we're

644
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,559
going to do next

645
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,720
we're going to write the card

646
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,159
it's not that hard

647
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,880
select all the sectors i can even do

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
this through my cell phone

649
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
write this back down onto the implant

650
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
it finds the new tag

651
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,480
select all sectors write the tag

652
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
and at this point now just to prove it

653
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,039
once everything is written

654
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,840
we're going to go ahead and we're going

655
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,399
to remap

656
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,520
there you go created the key map

657
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,799
now i'm going to go back into my

658
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,320
proxmart tool in this into channel 3

659
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
go ahead and scan my implant one more

660
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
time

661
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
we'll catch the uid and we're gonna name

662
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,678
this one implant two

663
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,960
and

664
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
pay close attention you'll see that

665
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,760
seven eight six eight nine i believe is

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,200
the last four digits of sector zero line

667
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
a six eight six nine

668
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,840
now if we click implant two

669
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,799
six eight six nine

670
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
so at this point i now have an exact

671
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
duplicate of the physical card written

672
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
down to an implant on my hand

673
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
you know

674
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,200
one of the things that you know to kat's

675
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,520
point from her previous discussion we

676
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
talk a lot about multi-factor

677
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
authentication

678
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,279
you know and the idea of mfa against any

679
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,960
type of sensitive data this is something

680
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
that's been beaten into our heads for

681
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
for years

682
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,080
why don't we do the same thing when it

683
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,880
comes to physical access

684
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
how many times do you see

685
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
just a badge reader with no pin

686
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
next to it

687
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
if you have a single point of failure

688
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,039
into your data center somebody like

689
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
myself can actually compromise your data

690
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
center sit there in your server room and

691
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,360
you have no idea how the hell i got in

692
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
there

693
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
and the worst you can do is actually

694
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,440
just happy trespassed off your property

695
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,279
because technically if i tell you you

696
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
know the door was open

697
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
you know i just walked in i thought this

698
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
was part of the tour

699
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
you know

700
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,880
i can play stupid and it's not up to me

701
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,520
it's up to the security on your physical

702
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,919
access as to whether or not they want to

703
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
try and go deeper they call the police

704
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,880
go ahead i've been arrested before

705
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,159
what are you going to arrest me for you

706
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,960
know it was an open door i'm sorry

707
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,279
you can't take me to jail you can't take

708
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,360
me in and question me

709
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,600
all you can do is tell me you don't come

710
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
back on our property

711
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,559
how do you know i haven't already

712
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,919
dropped something in your server room

713
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
you don't

714
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
so the next two use cases we're going to

715
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
be discussing are around near field

716
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,279
communication

717
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,240
uh

718
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
typical uses if you people aren't

719
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,559
familiar with nfc pretty much built into

720
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
every cell phone out there

721
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,880
heavily used in iot and loosely

722
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
connected devices

723
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
we're going to show two different

724
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,080
attacks today first one is going to be

725
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,159
called leprosy and then the second one's

726
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,000
going to be called flash hook

727
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,320
so if we talk about leprosy

728
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
this is kind of a social engineering

729
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
attack but if anybody's actually hung

730
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
out with me for more than five minutes

731
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,720
you know i'm a pretty personable guy

732
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
you know it's not hard

733
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,159
so i'm actually going to talk this

734
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,799
attack through for you guys in real time

735
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,840
this requires a little bit of social

736
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,120
engineering this will also give me

737
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
permanent persistence on the device

738
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,559
because what i've done is i've actually

739
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,960
created a malicious apk with mfs venom

740
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
which is the

741
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
utility to create callbacks for

742
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
metasploit

743
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,559
so

744
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,640
i'm here in the cayman islands beautiful

745
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
place love this place this place is

746
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,399
awesome

747
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,799
you know we've got b-sides going on

748
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
if i was sitting out there in between

749
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
sessions and you know started making a

750
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,919
big fuss about you know something

751
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,080
happening to one of my grandkids

752
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,559
you know my phone was dead

753
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,760
you know oh my god somebody help me

754
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
i guarantee you

755
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,760
that somebody would would actually give

756
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,440
me their phone

757
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,799
so let me show you what this looks like

758
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
in real life

759
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,200
guys video two please

760
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
so i'm gonna do this in real time

761
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,039
you know what we have up on the top is

762
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,279
my ngrok for obfuscation

763
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,760
i like to explain everything bottom

764
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,960
part of the screen we're actually going

765
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
to be launching our metasploit loading

766
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,440
it up with a resource file

767
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,360
and starting a listener

768
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,720
so let me do this in real time for you

769
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,600
guys as soon as you see the phone here

770
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200

i mean who the hell actually remembers

778
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,919

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,679

phone back

793
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,200
i've already popped the reverse shell on

794
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
your device

795
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
and here i can pop pull sysinfo

796
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
i can dump your call logs i can dump all

797
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,360
of your sms i can even spawn a shell and

798
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,279
actually navigate your entire file

799
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,640
system

800
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
it's not that hard

801
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,640
you know how do you as security

802
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,159
professionals

803
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,320
protect against an attack vector if you

804
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
don't know that it's even conceivably

805
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,480
existing

806
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,799
you know this is not star wars this is

807
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,760
not star trek this is 2002

808
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,640
and we're real

809
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,279
to that point

810
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,399
you know

811
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
the last attack vector we're going to

812
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
show today

813
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,919
is one called

814
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,520
flesh hook

815
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
anybody here familiar with the beef

816
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,439
sweet

817
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,039
i got one person i love beef

818
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,919
beef is the browser extension exploit

819
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,600
framework

820
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
so i'm assuming we've all heard that old

821
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,240
adage of be careful you know don't don't

822
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,399
log into you know bad websites because

823
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,320
if you do the the bad guys can get into

824
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,600
your computer just by getting to that

825
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
website

826
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,240
this is that website

827
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,279
it basically utilizes java and within

828
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,080
the

829
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,480
the header of the web page and actually

830
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,679
puts a hook into your device this one

831
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,720
all right

832
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
let's be honest

833
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
how many people in here are iphone

834
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,080
people

835
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
androids

836
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
yay

837
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,720
android people we're all screwed

838
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
to my iphone friends out there you guys

839
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,720
are okay for a little bit longer

840
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,520
apple has a proprietary nfc chip that is

841
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
currently being challenged in the courts

842
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,039
in europe right now

843
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
if they lose

844
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,159
you're going to be just as vulnerable as

845
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,159
the rest of us android people

846
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,760
and the only difference is the fact that

847
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
androids will do native reads and writes

848
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,760
of nfc

849
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,000
on an iphone you actually have to gain

850
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
access to nfc through an app

851
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
but

852
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
if they lose

853
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,480
you guys are just as susceptible as we

854
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,600
are

855
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
and this particular attack is the only

856
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
attack that i've got in my repertoire

857
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,799
that i'm willing to show today

858
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
that actually can be used against an

859
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
iphone because all i'm doing is

860
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,399
utilizing the nfc and chip in my hand

861
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,960
to actually redirect them to an actual

862
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,679
website that i own

863
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,559
so

864
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,480
details around this one it does require

865
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,559
some social engineering

866
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,000
and essentially like i said we're going

867
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,320
to trigger the url from the implant and

868
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,760
we're going to point them at one of my

869
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,679
servers

870
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,840
video three

871
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,480
please

872
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
so again i'm very very honest and blunt

873
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,960
in my demonstrations i want people to

874
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,919
learn

875
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,600
so you'll find that it actually takes

876
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
longer for me to actually load up the

877
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,279
beef suite than it does to actually

878
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,840
compromise the

879
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,440
device so in five four three two one yay

880
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
here we go all right

881
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,080
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna

882
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,399
open up firefox and log into the beef

883
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,960
control panel

884
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,720
go in as an admin if you've never used

885
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
this this is an amazing tool

886
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,320
and because i deal with mostly technical

887
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,840
people what i've done is i've actually

888
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,200
cloned the putty website

889
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
and

890
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,919
all i have to do is get the phone into

891
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,320
my hands hey man check this out you know

892
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,799
i got a youtube video i want to send you

893
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,399
you know let me pull it up for you

894
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
meantime all i'm what i'm doing is i'm

895
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,880
triggering you to go into my website

896
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,559
hand you your phone back it looks like

897
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,919
putty

898
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,679
but if you take a look now i've got a

899
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,559
new online device from the icons you can

900
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,039
see that it's an android from the main

901
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,279
page i can get pretty much most of the

902
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,760
information about that device in terms

903
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,720
of

904
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,559
what type

905
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,399
but now i actually have the ability to

906
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,200
run

907
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
predefined modules

908
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,679
so let's let's have some fun let's do

909
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
some geolocation so i can actually

910
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,720
identify where you are in the world

911
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,000
just by you logging into a website

912
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
and if we take a look here we'll see

913
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
that it'll show that

914
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,760
i'm in the united states in texas in the

915
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,279
city of flugerville

916
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,880
which is where i was when i created this

917
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,399
video

918
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,799
if you're connected to a network i can

919
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,880
do complete ip

920
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,039
enumeration

921
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,399
and i can ride your into your vpn right

922
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,000
back into your your corporate

923
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
environment

924
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
i can even do spear phishing attacks on

925
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,080
the device itself

926
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,799
we're going to go ahead and launch a

927
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,880
ping sweep here so this will start at

928
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,480
whatever the subnet is and go from 0 to

929
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,720
255.

930
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
and i can turn around and use that to

931
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
the whatever i want

932
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,480
and

933
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
the whole point is all of this was

934
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
initiated from implants that are inside

935
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
my hands

936
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,480
so

937
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,840
we are here we're not going

938
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,519
anywhere and the truth is if you don't

939
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,120
start taking a look at the fact that

940
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
these are real attack vectors

941
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
you might be putting your

942
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,760
self as well as your corporate

943
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,679
environments in a very vulnerable

944
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,760
position

945
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,360
when we talk about the trans-human

946
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,240
movement

947
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,279
what will we become tomorrow

948
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,840
you know when we talk about the future

949
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,320
of grinders and trans humans like myself

950
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
it's almost like we're trying to write a

951
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
brand new science fiction movie you know

952
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,840
we have tesla

953
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,919
with the neural ink

954
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,440
and if you thought they were the only

955
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,799
ones that were trying to do the brain

956
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
implants they're not

957
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,799
their biggest competitor actually

958
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,640
started human trials

959
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,360
last week

960
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
uh tesla actually released information

961
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,600
that they had implanted the neurolink

962
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,279
into 13 chimpanzees and seven of them

963
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,760
unfortunately did not make it

964
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
so before anybody asks would len len

965
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
will you get a brain implant quite

966
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
possibly but i'm not going to be the

967
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,839
guinea pig for that one

968
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,239
we have things like the will it

969
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,679
if you haven't heard about it this this

970
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,280
is actually a bluetooth transmitter and

971
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,599
receiver that has no internal battery

972
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,440
and actually takes its energy

973
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,839
from the atmosphere

974
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,719
beyond that when it comes to internal

975
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,599
bio

976
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
bio implants there's been major

977
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,760
breakthroughs over the last two months

978
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
that now we have the ability to power

979
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,359
implants with the body's internal

980
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,079
thermal heat

981
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,119
so

982
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,320
as you if you remember when i was

983
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
talking about the peg leg we had that

984
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
indirect power charger because the truth

985
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
is we can't have a battery inside of us

986
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
yet

987
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,000
at least from a commercial scale

988
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
i mean we could

989
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
but has anybody ever used like uh you

990
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,399
know one of those rapid wireless

991
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,880
chargers on your cell phones

992
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,280
if you put that your phone on that pad

993
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,800
and leave it there for about 45 minutes

994
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
when you pick it up what does it feel

995
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,680
like

996
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
hot

997
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,040
very hot

998
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,760
so as such that is not something that i

999
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,680
personally would like to feel inside my

1000
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,200
body

1001
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
to that point

1002
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
you know anyone that thinks that having

1003
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,160
magnets in your hand is just a really

1004
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,599
cool thing still you know i i'm this

1005
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,200
everybody tells me i'm this rather you

1006
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
know intimidating looking gentleman i

1007
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,680
don't necessarily agree

1008
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,400
but

1009
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
you know what my biggest fear is

1010
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,800
mris is up there yes mris are definitely

1011
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,680
up there

1012
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,799
but honestly magnets

1013
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,079
you think you know pain imagine

1014
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,480
you know my brother is a love loves to

1015
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
be a prankster

1016
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
he actually put an earth magnet in my

1017
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,359
pocket one day

1018
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,920
imagine being pinched from the inside

1019
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,079
and the outside of your skin it is not a

1020
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,760
pleasant feeling

1021
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,839
you know so

1022
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,000
yeah

1023
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
finally you know we can talk about

1024
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,760
things like the neura grain this one to

1025
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,560
me is the we have definitely left the

1026
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
reservation and we're going out into

1027
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,119
uncharted waters

1028
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,760
the neuro grain is an implantable wi-fi

1029
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
transmitter and receiver

1030
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,079
and the mission statement of this

1031
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,400
company is to basically turn the human

1032
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
population into the world's largest

1033
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
wi-fi mesh network

1034
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,839
you want to talk about hacking your

1035
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,160
neighbor's wi-fi being a completely new

1036
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,520
terminology

1037
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,320
and this is what we're looking at

1038
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,960
you know we've seen massive improvements

1039
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,119
in graphene battery

1040
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,880
technology over the last five to six

1041
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,000
months

1042
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520
you know we also have the ability like i

1043
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
said to generate energy from the body's

1044
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
thermal heat

1045
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,720
we have all of this technology and the

1046
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,400
only thing that's stopping the the

1047
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,520
transhuman movement is internal reliable

1048
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
power

1049
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
well it's common

1050
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
so if you're the security admin at your

1051
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
facility or you're the you know the ciso

1052
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,200
how do you deal with the fact that

1053
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
human beings are now putting these types

1054
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
of things in their bodies

1055
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
you know one of the questions i love to

1056
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
ask is is does the fact that somebody

1057
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,880
has an implanted technology

1058
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,920
automatically make them a threat

1059
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,880
anyone

1060
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,960
if somebody was to say

1061
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,640
get an implant of an rfid or an nfc chip

1062
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
and they're using it for the purposes

1063
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,960
like i said on the standard use cases

1064
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,079
you know maybe they're using it to

1065
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,240
access a garage or a gym

1066
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
does that automatically make them more

1067
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,599
of a threat

1068
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,800
from

1069
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,440
a ciso or a corporate environment's

1070
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
perspective

1071
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,680
than

1072
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,720
your standard joe average

1073
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,960
you know my concern being

1074
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,760
a transhuman is the fact that you know

1075
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,240
people don't understand this i mean i've

1076
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,560
had people ask me for starters you know

1077
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,079
just to give you all some a little you

1078
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,880
know ha ha you know some of the

1079
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
questions i've been asked are absolutely

1080
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,400
hysterical

1081
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,520
you know len

1082
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,880
is that what happened after you got your

1083
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,560
coveted vaccination

1084
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,079
yes

1085
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,760
if if you want to ask me that question

1086
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,599
then the answer is yes

1087
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,200
you know is that the same chip that's

1088
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,599
inside my cat or my dog

1089
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,960
sure

1090
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
if that's what you think go ahead

1091
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
you know to be honest i've even caught

1092
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,000
the the the attention of some extreme

1093
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,760
religious groups

1094
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,359
i've actually i

1095
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,480
this is

1096
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,680
no joke

1097
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
i actually didn't even know they did

1098
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,920
this

1099
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
but i actually found an article that was

1100
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,839
written quote you know utilizing some of

1101
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,960
the

1102
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
data that was put out there in some of

1103
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,480
the interviews that i've done and i've

1104
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,800
actually been basically labeled as

1105
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,079
having the mark of the beast

1106
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
i'm not trying to be disrespectful to

1107
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
anybody's faith or or their their

1108
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,200
philosophies i'm really not

1109
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,440
you know i can freely tell you i am not

1110
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,520
a demon well if you ask my wife she

1111
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
might say differently but no i'm not i'm

1112
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,480
not

1113
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
anything like that i'm just a guy who

1114
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,599
decided

1115
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,920
that i love technology to the point

1116
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,760
where i wanted to be able to trigger

1117
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,800
things

1118
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,960
and do things that most normal people

1119
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
couldn't

1120
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
but my fear

1121
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,320
is that as people like myself become

1122
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,040
more and more open about this

1123
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
you know there are there are tens of

1124
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,880
thousands of modified human beings out

1125
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,960
there in the world right now

1126
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
and the truth is most people don't say

1127
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
anything due to the stigma that is

1128
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,720
associated with implanted technologies

1129
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,160
i don't care

1130
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,280
you know

1131
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
if you want to say that i have the mark

1132
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,160
of the beast go ahead i don't care if

1133
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,320
you want to say that i'm a freak again i

1134
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
don't care

1135
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
whether i'm a freak or not is irrelevant

1136
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,160
to the fact that i i have the ability to

1137
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
do these types of things and if you are

1138
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,359
the security professionals within your

1139
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,040
organizations you need to learn how to

1140
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,240
adapt to deal with me

1141
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,200
because

1142
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,359
don't quote me on this next part because

1143
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,520
i'm still trying to get the actual

1144
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,200
correct term

1145
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,319
but back in the day before the tsa in

1146
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,560
america was the ones that handled the

1147
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
airplane security i worked for a company

1148
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
that did similar

1149
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,200
i did that job of tsa before tsa

1150
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
and yes i know that that kind of carbon

1151
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,319
dates me a little bit

1152
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,359
but

1153
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
the magnetometers in airports are

1154
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,480
looking for a specific amount of metal

1155
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
that's why sometimes you can get away

1156
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
with wearing a necklace but you can't

1157
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
wear your belt

1158
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,119
the total amount of metal that is within

1159
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,720
my implants is

1160
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,800
below that threshold

1161
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
you will not detect me

1162
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,319
i've been through the standard

1163
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,839
magnetometers i've been through the

1164
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,599
x-rays

1165
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,920
you can't catch me

1166
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,599
the fact that i'm working on low

1167
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,760
frequency and high frequency rfid and

1168
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,599
nfc which means that you would need to

1169
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,240
have some type of a spectrum analyzer

1170
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
broadcasting on those exact frequencies

1171
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,319
of the chips that i have in order to be

1172
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,160
able to detect me

1173
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,760
and the idea of putting one of those in

1174
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,680
front of every single one of your doors

1175
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,200
and your entry points on your physical

1176
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,560
locations

1177
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,839
is not manageable

1178
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,800
so

1179
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,680
that being said how do we address

1180
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,480
people like me

1181
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,200
i i can't say it enough it's security

1182
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
and layers

1183
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,960
you know as far as your mobile devices

1184
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,800
you know

1185
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,640
identity security

1186
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,720
multi-factor any of your accounts to the

1187
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
point where if i get in it's not going

1188
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
to i'm not going to be able to lateral

1189
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
and escalate with those

1190
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,160
when it comes to our physical on-prem

1191
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
locations

1192
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,040
you know

1193
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,200
how many people here use multi-factor

1194
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,800
authentication to access sensitive data

1195
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,040
on their networks

1196
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
okay pretty much common sense we've all

1197
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,480
been doing this forever

1198
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,079
how many of those you know and if you

1199
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,440
don't want to answer this next question

1200
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,800
i understand

1201
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
how many people have a server room with

1202
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,680
a single

1203
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,799
badge in with nothing else

1204
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,520
and we hear the crickets go

1205
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,440
you know this is the issue

1206
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,200
these are the types of attacks that are

1207
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,359
going to be coming forward

1208
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,599
uh i haven't the next iteration of this

1209
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,119
talk is actually coming out in september

1210
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,560
if you find this stuff interesting keep

1211
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,000
an eye on me because i've actually

1212
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,440
figured out how to drop ransomware

1213
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,240
through my implants

1214
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
and i can deploy crypto miners with my

1215
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,599
implants

1216
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,960
on top of the fact that i'm bringing

1217
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,359
three new implants on just to see what i

1218
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,000
can do with them

1219
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
but

1220
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,560
it's all about security in layers ladies

1221
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,680
and gentlemen

1222
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,119
and anything in between you know let's

1223
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,880
take advantage of the fact that

1224
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,480
now you know

1225
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,200
now i've made you aware

1226
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,040
what you do with it up to the after this

1227
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,200
is up to you

1228
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,960
but there are people like me and i can

1229
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,319
tell you for fact that i know a couple

1230
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,160
of guys that work on red teams in the

1231
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,599
united states

1232
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,200
that have these same type of

1233
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,720
capabilities and they use them during

1234
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,319
red team engagements as your initial

1235
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,920
foothold

1236
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,440
you know as more and more people are

1237
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,240
doing

1238
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,720
more corporate type activities from

1239
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,319
their mobile and loosely connected

1240
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,200
devices most of the time we'll see a vpn

1241
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,440
or some type of a secured transport

1242
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,400
layer back to their their company

1243
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
if i get into your mobile device i can

1244
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,319
ride that all the way in and get an

1245
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,800
initial foothold within your on-prem and

1246
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,920
from there i can actually launch

1247
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,839
advanced persistence attacks

1248
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,319
lateral movements privilege escalations

1249
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,520
hell i can even try and go for a

1250
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,960
complete domain takeover and throw a

1251
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,359
golden ticket at you

1252
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,240
but the only way to stop this is to to

1253
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
get in front of it now

1254
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,440
we layer that security remove single

1255
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,599
points of failure

1256
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,079
look into locking down anything on your

1257
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,280
mobile devices and for god's sakes

1258
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,079
if you're using not using nfc on your

1259
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
mobile device

1260
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,680
turn it off

1261
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,200
i mean that's honestly the smartest

1262
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,280
advice i can give you

1263
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,680
people you know it comes up a lot with

1264
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,160
iot

1265
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,240
if you're not using

1266
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,359
nfc turn it off keep your updates on

1267
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,720
your phone make sure you get all your

1268
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,680
security patches for physical access

1269
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,520
look into uh

1270
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,599
shields look into

1271
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,319
pin codes do not allow a single point of

1272
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,480
failure

1273
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,920
and with that

1274
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
i'm going to go ahead and usually i have

1275
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,560
a lot of questions so

1276
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,799
let's go

1277
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,119
so i'm gonna push back a little on one

1278
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,160
of your statements go forward

1279
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,359
oh

1280
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,520
hi uh so i'm going to

1281
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,680
one push back and and a question people

1282
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,800
are walking around with cochlear

1283
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,920
implants

1284
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,119
with

1285
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,359
rods and rods in their brains with the

1286
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,200
electricity to prevent practice you're

1287
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,560
talking about the artist yeah i've seen

1288
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,480
parkinson's and

1289
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,280
and you know and other augment all other

1290
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
things to augment

1291
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
with normal normal human function i i

1292
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,880
think the

1293
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
what you're describing is just things

1294
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,400
that people aren't use

1295
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,760
used to that they don't see like an

1296
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,319
obvious obvious thing that they can see

1297
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,400
with their with their eyes correct per

1298
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
se so i i don't think that people are

1299
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,440
are seeing they augment itself

1300
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,480
as something strange or new is just

1301
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
what devices

1302
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,040
that is in somebody

1303
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,319
the idea

1304
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,160
i i think i see where you're coming from

1305
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,520
and the truth is

1306
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,680
you know like i said i know two guys

1307
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,200
that actually have peg legs so they have

1308
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,240
full linux distros in their legs

1309
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,200
and

1310
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,079
multiple people i know in the red team

1311
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,680
world use the

1312
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,079
the nfc implants as their initial

1313
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,319
footholds on to get into a larger

1314
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,599
environment

1315
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,760
and the point behind what i'm trying to

1316
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
just to present to you guys today is not

1317
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
the idea that i'm not giving you

1318
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
anything that hasn't been done before

1319
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
i'm just giving you something that's

1320
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,800
been done before in a different way

1321
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,400
you know because if we take a look at

1322
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,240
you know what the way things used to be

1323
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,880
the ability to clone id cards and badges

1324
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,240
like i said has been around for almost

1325
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
15 years

1326
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,839
but up until this point you if you got

1327
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,680
caught and this is the big thing about

1328
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,160
these attacks is the lack of indications

1329
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,599
of compromise

1330
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,520
so for your digital forensics and your

1331
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,920
incident response teams this becomes a

1332
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,599
major issue

1333
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,280
you know because unlike before where you

1334
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,800
know i would have a badge that i've

1335
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,560
cloned or i would have some type of a

1336
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
device that i could use to emulate a

1337
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,400
card that i was able to scrape

1338
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,160
there's nothing

1339
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,319
you can strip search have the cops strip

1340
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,240
search me and there is nothing that

1341
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,680
they're gonna find

1342
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,280
but yet i was still in the middle of

1343
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
your server room

1344
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,000
how do you how do you address that how

1345
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
do you follow up after that okay

1346
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,480
i hear you my one question

1347
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,280
has to do with uh secure encaps

1348
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,079
on

1349
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,240
like i said on phones or on devices that

1350
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,880
have nfcs and you know secure on case

1351
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,480
that have to do with certificates and so

1352
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,839
forth and things like that

1353
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,480
would the attacks that you describe work

1354
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,720
on on those devices that have those

1355
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,520
secure on cables depends on the settings

1356
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,000
of those devices

1357
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,880
i mean

1358
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,599
to be honest the secure enclave devices

1359
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,200
are good

1360
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,359
but you have the ability to modify the

1361
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,599
the policy sets on them and you can

1362
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,440
white list things

1363
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,200
so

1364
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,880
the one thing about my chips is i have

1365
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,440
the ability to modify the uid and i can

1366
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,400
change

1367
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,160
them from

1368
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,839
i mean some of these i can actually have

1369
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,280
appear as

1370
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,240
multiple

1371
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
different types of contactless

1372
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,599
technology

1373
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,440
so it's a matter of just continuing to

1374
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,400
flip the uids and the device identifiers

1375
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,920
until i find one that your device will

1376
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,720
read

1377
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,119
okay thank you absolutely good question

1378
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
got one in the back

1379
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,240
all right

1380
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
i get a lot i i'm the and for the record

1381
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
ladies and gentlemen

1382
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,160
i i do not believe that there is

1383
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,200
anything

1384
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,040
as a dumb question

1385
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,000
so

1386
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,760
go ahead and ask whatever's on your mind

1387
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,920
i know i'm i'm way out there in left

1388
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,079
field man no i was just wondering are

1389
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,680
you in the uh the dangerous things

1390
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,720
discord

1391
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,760
i am

1392
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,319
you are okay yeah so i also am i'm i'm

1393
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,559
uh the one developing the keyless entry

1394
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,559
system for toyota and lexus all right

1395
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,960
now on the way to go dude yeah i've got

1396
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,200
the s i id or whatever it's called in

1397
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,440
the left hand

1398
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,800
yup so here's another part of my clue

1399
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,920
you know

1400
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,559
don't that he's trying to do you know

1401
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,520
work for actual access

1402
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,800
does that make him dangerous

1403
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,240
but at the same time how do you

1404
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,079
differentiate between a gentleman like

1405
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,960
him and somebody like me

1406
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,480
you know

1407
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,800
my hopes are to at least educate you

1408
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,880
guys on the existence of these type of

1409
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,559
attack vectors and

1410
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,480
you know take this back and and do

1411
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,000
something with it you know we have no

1412
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,160
way that we can actually stop single

1413
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,839
points of failure

1414
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,720
talk to me the funny thing is i am doing

1415
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
something about it because just a couple

1416
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,880
months ago i started working on a new

1417
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,000
talk on the human threat threat model

1418
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,400
and when i met you today i'm going holy

1419
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,920
crap

1420
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,720
he's i'm living proof yeah you're kind

1421
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,599
of where i came from this was reading

1422
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,839
about various different implants and

1423
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,280
what they could do

1424
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,079
and i took it to that level was how do

1425
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,440
we mitigate

1426
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,960
against that and that's going to be a

1427
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,200
talk i'm bringing out i'd love to work

1428
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,559
with you on it

1429
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,559
because the truth is you know there are

1430
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,200
many people out there like me and

1431
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,720
you know as security professionals we

1432
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,880
need to be able to account and

1433
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,520
and mitigate these new vectors

1434
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,680
i mean we all know not to click on links

1435
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,160
in emails we know not to

1436
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,280
just plug random usb devices in but you

1437
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,280
know these are the same types of

1438
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
technologies that can be launched

1439
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,240
through

1440
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,520
bioengineering implants

1441
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,680
what's the impact

1442
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,559
sorry so i didn't catch that i apologize

1443
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,200
um what's the um health impact having

1444
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,000
these

1445
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,200
implants

1446
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,480
um

1447
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
so far i have had zero rejection

1448
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,319
so i did have a little bit of an issue

1449
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,760
uh these are

1450
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,240
to put in the bio glass encapsulated

1451
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,760
chips it's not that hard they come pre

1452
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,559
most of the time they come

1453
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,359
pre-sterilized in like a hypodermic

1454
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,400
needle

1455
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,640
that's a little bit larger that you know

1456
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,400
that would normally be used for like

1457
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,079
body piercing

1458
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:56,800
but

1459
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
the flex membrane implants these are

1460
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,280
actual surgeries so they they cut me

1461
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,240
open

1462
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,319
they use dermal elevators they separate

1463
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
the skin from the muscle tissue below

1464
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,880
they create a pocket they insert the the

1465
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,240
microchip and then it gets sewed shut

1466
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,000
and i'm surprised nobody's asked me the

1467
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,520
question about doctors that's usually

1468
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,599
one of the first ones to come out

1469
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,400
no len does not go to a doctor

1470
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
len does not trust doctors

1471
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,000
however len has no problems with

1472
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,040
trusting a

1473
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
large polynesian gentleman with facial

1474
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,079
tattoos named pineapple

1475
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,119
but the only health concerns that i've

1476
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,800
ever had was

1477
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
anyone that's ever had any type of you

1478
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,960
know medical surgery

1479
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
you know they tell you to get on you

1480
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,200
know anti-inflammatories prior to your

1481
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,440
your surgery i was the smart ass and did

1482
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,079
not do that so when i had the large one

1483
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,680
implanted here i developed a bit of a

1484
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,559
hematoma under here went to the doctors

1485
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,319
and was like you know hey i just need

1486
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,079
some prescription grade advil so i can

1487
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,119
get the swelling to go down they were

1488
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,400
like we need to schedule a surgery and

1489
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,240
get that out of you it's like dude i

1490
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,040
just spent 350 bucks putting that in

1491
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,680
you're not taking it out

1492
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,760
sir all right uh

1493
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,119
i think

1494
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,640
there are two problems with what you

1495
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,480
have what you have going on there first

1496
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
one

1497
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,599
is that as you uh begin to implant those

1498
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,520
things especially since they're running

1499
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,240
uh operating systems they're not

1500
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,720
well i mean like with peg let's say and

1501
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
you run a linux on a on a system in your

1502
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,400
body

1503
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
it would carry an ip address and it

1504
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,200
would become hackable itself um

1505
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
to that point there is no ip address

1506
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,319
because these are nfc and rfid

1507
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,160
however they are

1508
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,800
anyone would have the ability to write

1509
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,559
and close the chips

1510
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,280
um i actually have faraday gloves that

1511
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,520
i've made for myself so that i can

1512
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,319
attend functions like defcon black hat

1513
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,400
you know and protect myself there is

1514
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,480
nothing that someone could do to any one

1515
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,240
of my implants that could cause physical

1516
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,920
harm to me

1517
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,760
but what they could do

1518
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,359
if you've been around long enough that

1519
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,440
you remember the old rewritable cd-rom

1520
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,880
days

1521
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,160
yeah i know there's a few of us that

1522
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,680
here that just laughed

1523
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,000
you know you could essentially close the

1524
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,280
tag

1525
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,200
and then i would not be able to rewrite

1526
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,720
it with anything new

1527
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,240
and i would need to basically have it

1528
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,839
removed and replaced in order to get

1529
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,760
something else there so that is

1530
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,440
something that is a concern of mine to

1531
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,880
the point where like i said i actually

1532
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,920
paid a seamstress to take a pair of

1533
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,480
racing gloves and line them with faraday

1534
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,440
fabric so that i can turn my hands off

1535
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,640
because they are

1536
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
as i said these are nfc and rfid they

1537
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,000
have no internal power right and and

1538
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,359
speak into that

1539
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,880
um

1540
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,119
a lot of the technology now that depends

1541
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,200
on uh power that you don't have to have

1542
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,760
a battery for is based on inductance so

1543
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,599
like that bluetooth chip

1544
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,960
is like you move your hand through the

1545
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,160
air

1546
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,839
it's basically metal moving through to

1547
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,720
its magnetic field it charges

1548
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,559
things along i'm sorry i'm having a i'm

1549
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,079
gonna i'm gonna walk over here and no

1550
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,680
disrespect i'm just having a hard time

1551
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,559
with

1552
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,920
understanding and i want to give you the

1553
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,559
correct answer no what i'm saying is um

1554
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,470
[Laughter]

1555
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,240
you all can laugh at me i miss the day

1556
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,319
when in the united states they said okay

1557
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,839
we're switching to the metric system on

1558
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,359
tuesday

1559
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,000
and i just we never did so

1560
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,280
somebody who wants to do the conversion

1561
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,040
for me the large implant i can get about

1562
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,200
two and a half to three inches with

1563
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,280
right so what i was asking is a lot of

1564
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,200
the these chips or even the bluetooth

1565
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,000
you were showing uh in your presentation

1566
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,040
a lot of the power that it it it uses is

1567
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,880
based on metal moving through the

1568
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,520
magnetic field in the air the its magnet

1569
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
so it right so it is able to use small

1570
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,240
amounts of energy through inductance

1571
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,040
magnetic inductance yes so essentially

1572
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,240
to stop your you from being uh

1573
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,079
we just have to run

1574
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,920
a massive magnetic field through the

1575
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,040
building and

1576
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,920
even faraday gloves yeah yeah fair you

1577
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,280
know

1578
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,640
yeah yeah

1579
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,440
electromagnets are not my friend so yes

1580
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,599
but no yeah but real let's be honest and

1581
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,280
realistic about it though the idea of

1582
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,920
trying to submit the human body to large

1583
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,760
magnetic fields is probably not a good

1584
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,079
idea i mean i'm not saying that this

1585
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,240
actually happened but i mean there was a

1586
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,880
big thing about you know the u.s embassy

1587
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,520
uh embassy in uh

1588
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,720
tell me out here

1589
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,200
in haiti you're not haiti but uh cuba

1590
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,079
cuba

1591
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,680
you know where everybody was getting

1592
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,200
sick and they were like oh we think it's

1593
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,680
sonic or you know some type of sound

1594
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,799
type thing

1595
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,920
so i mean could it happen yeah

1596
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,799
but

1597
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,559
my whole point

1598
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,040
to you guys is just because somebody has

1599
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,400
one of these doesn't make them a threat

1600
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,680
you know and if we go forward with

1601
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,440
just the thinking that you know anybody

1602
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,920
with a microchip instantly becomes you

1603
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,480
know a potential cyber threat

1604
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,440
that to me is very discriminatory

1605
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,280
because there are

1606
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,760
i'm one of a very very few select people

1607
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
that have chosen to use the implants in

1608
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,599
this way

1609
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,200
you know i would rather just bring them

1610
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,680
out bring it out and say look guys these

1611
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,520
type of attacks can happen so let's

1612
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,440
let's layer our security approach in

1613
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,880
front of this

1614
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,720
to take care of the

1615
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,839
potential

1616
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,000
bad actors and the threat actors but

1617
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,599
still allow you know

1618
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,920
tom and jane and to go ahead and use

1619
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,000
their implants to get into their gym and

1620
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
it's not a big deal

1621
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,040
so

1622
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,599
rather than focusing on the potential

1623
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,440
attacker i think as security

1624
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,520
professionals we need to look at our own

1625
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,839
security stacks and put enough controls

1626
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,359
in front of it that it becomes a

1627
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,760
non-issue

1628
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
but a very very good point is there

1629
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,119
anything any other questions out here

1630
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,119
today

1631
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,920
well if that's the case i'd like to

1632
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,359
thank you guys very much for attending

1633
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,520
my session uh if you have any questions

1634
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,839
or anything please feel free i'm i'm

1635
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,040
really really active on social

1636
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,599
and uh they shut my presentation off

1637
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,760
already but i'm very active on social

1638
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,520
look me up on linkedin i've got a

1639
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,040
youtube channel and i do a lot with the

1640
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,880
transhuman movement so

1641
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,480
please feel free to reach out thank you

1642
