the end

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
um so as it says up there um and you may

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
not know we existed um i'm from the

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
cyber crime and digital forensic unit

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,240
which is part of the rcips

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,159
um

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
so i'm going to go through a little bit

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
of

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
my experience prior to coming here

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
just to give you an idea who i am and

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,679
what i've done

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
so i was a police officer for 30 years

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,320
um

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
mostly in major crime investigations

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,840
murders rapes

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,159
um i actually set up in my force the

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,640
first high-tech crime unit

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
um i did want to advertise um for people

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
by saying are you a geek please come and

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,479
see me um but hr wouldn't let me do that

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
after i left the place i

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
became involved in teaching police

41
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
officers to

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
do open source intelligence

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
which is basically

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,199
one of the things that um ashley spoke

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
about yesterday about

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
using facebook um

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
twitter

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
and other materials to find out about

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
people because um

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
people just give away so much online and

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
then sometimes it makes our jobs a

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
little bit easier

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,400
as part of that i was actually

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
at uc online which means i was an

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
undercover officer online specifically

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
in irc chat rooms

57
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
i don't know if anybody

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
is aware of the uk tv program called

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,040
catherine tate but i named myself lauren

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
and modeled myself on lauren

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
and had to learn the language of a 14

62
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
year old girl because that's what i was

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,599
um

64
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
my kids used to get fed up with me

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
putting my hand up and saying whatever

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
and putting laws at the end of all my

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,840
texts

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
it was an interesting experience

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
after that i was recruited by the

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
national crime agency into the national

71
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,959
cyber crime unit

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,560
i was involved in

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,519
a number of investigations and having

74
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,959
been sat in the audience for a couple of

75
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
days it's actually um

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
quite amusing really because most of the

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
investigations that people were talking

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
about i was actively involved in

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
um

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,560
i think the first speaker mentioned

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
wannacry uh and when the splash screen

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
came on

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
to the the main screen for the

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
ransomware

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
i think my eyes started twitching again

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
for one of the longest weekends of my

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
entire

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,599
my entire life

89
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
i was actually

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,959
um

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
i was also involved in um

92
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,400
mirai

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
botnet um a gentleman called daniel k

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
who used the miraibotnet to target

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
lloyd's bank and barclays bank

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,040
currently residing at hm prison due to

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
my well my my team's effort

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
but most of my experience is based in

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
working within the ncsc at gchq and the

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
uk london headquarters

101
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
so for four years i was there basically

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
involved in investigating the most

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
serious cyber attacks in the uk

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,199
um

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
i know ashley mentioned yesterday the

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
the case we were involved in here about

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,479
um

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
the as the the pedophile

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
and um

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
the

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
i gave expert

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
evidence that he hadn't been hacked or

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
had rdp access into his system

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
um the barrister

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
said to me after gone through my

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
qualifications he went qualifications

117
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
are all very well and good but what

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
experience have you got which allowed me

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
to say i've just spent the last four

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,040
years doing this

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
and we then had a little poker game

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,479
where i was basically going i i see your

123
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
20 minutes on google and i raise you

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
my experience of doing this

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
um i was actually during the monaco

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,639
investigation i was actually in the room

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,000
um sat next to the nsa

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
sharpie

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
when we discovered that it was eternal

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
blue which if you don't know is an nsa

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
exploit

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
and he just said one word

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,759
which was

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
um

135
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
i was also actually involved in the one

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
that we spoke about this morning uh the

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
previous speaker the coinbase um he

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
didn't mention an email that they that

139
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
they clicked on

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
that email actually emanated in the uk

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
so we were involved in trying it was a

142
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
compromised account obviously so we're

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
involved in trying to bottom out

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
where the compromised account had come

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
from

146
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
um and now i'm here so i went from a

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
building with 5 000 people um to an

148
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
office of four

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
so what brought me here

150
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,919
um well i would like to say the sunshine

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
but it was actually the the very

152
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
affordable rent

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
um the reasonable cost of living

154
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,160
and the incredible standards of driving

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,960
i've seen on the island i'll go back to

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
the first one which was sunshine

157
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
actually

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,440
so why am i doing this presentation

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,639
um i want to get the messaging out as

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
far as possible

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
the the cyber crime team itself is quite

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
new it's only really been formed since

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
i've been on the island

164
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
um and i'm not sure how many people knew

165
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
we existed so um i'd met with um a

166
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
couple of people who'd introduced mickey

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,440
james

168
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
i had to meet with james and he went

169
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
look the best place for you to get your

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
messaging out is here so that's why i'm

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
here at the moment

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
um

173
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,599
um the rcips have a three-year strategic

174
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,280
plan part of that strategic plan

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
is

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
and this is generic to all forms of

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
policing but it's to understand a threat

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
secure the cayman islands

179
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
and ensure safer communities

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,479
now i'm charged with driving that as far

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,280
as

182
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
cyber crime is concerned as well

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
but

184
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
that's going to be impossible

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
without you

186
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
help and that's really why i'm here is

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,759
to tell you what we're trying to do and

188
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
say to you let's get involved let's work

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
together

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
um because hopefully you've seen i do

191
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
bring a lot of experience i doubt

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
there's anybody else in the island

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,520
who's studied apts um hostile state

194
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,240
actors um significant cyber crime groups

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
um one of the investigations i was

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,680
heavily involved in was the um

197
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
[Music]

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,440
maximum yakibets known as

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,599
can't even say it aqua

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
um and the evil core group if you don't

201
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,960
know who they are

202
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,080
google them

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
because if nothing else they'll tell you

204
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
cyber crime pays

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,720
google maxim riacobet's wedding and

206
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,319
you'll see the most lavish wedding i've

207
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,199
ever seen in my life

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
what we're trying to do is to make

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
cayman islands a hostile envoy

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
environment for criminals i

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
can't do that on my own i need to do it

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
with you guys

213
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
um we do try and take a 4p approach to

214
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,520
cybercrime

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,240
which is prepare

216
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
mitigate the impact of serious cyber

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,760
attack exercising

218
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
protect

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
strengthen protection against serious

220
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
cyber attack

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,839
prevent

222
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,800
um prevent people becoming involved in

223
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
cyber crime that actually gets less and

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,680
less the more cyber crime moves abroad

225
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,000
and lastly pursue

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
which is this detect disrupt and

227
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,279
prosecute

228
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
the prosecutor is always going to be

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
difficult because a lot of the cyber

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
criminals are not based anywhere in the

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,560
jurisdiction that is user-friendly

232
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,800
however we can disrupt

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,920
um i put out some publicity the other

234
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,959
day

235
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,000
about

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
a fishing campaign that purported to

237
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
come from sydney

238
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,360
in actual fact if you clicked on that

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
link

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
that site had already been blocked by

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
the government systems

242
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
so it shows your disruption can work

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
and that's what i can do

244
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
so my mantra from my experience

245
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
complacency is the enemy of cyber

246
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,279
security

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
and i mean complacency has and it will

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
never happen to me we're okay

249
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
we've got everything right nobody can do

250
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
anything to us

251
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
and because my experience from the uk is

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
that that's never really true

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
secure by design sounds lovely

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
but it's just design

255
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,160
application maintenance i think cat

256
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,399
spoke about it yesterday as well

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
you can only design

258
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
if you know what the weaponization is

259
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
and that's one of the issues i've got

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
here at the moment

261
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
oops

262
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
you only know how much you need a system

263
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,480
when you don't have it

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
um the attacks i've dealt with took down

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
entire networks um and people just

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
didn't realize what they were and i'll

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
talk more about those in a moment

268
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
yeah i know it's expensive

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,440
but what happens

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
so this was an investigation and

271
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,200
involved in europeans europeans were the

272
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
biggest supplier of of forensics that's

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
wet forensics in the uk

274
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,959
and they were taken out by ryuk

275
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,560
um i love when it says it's highly

276
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
sophisticated as rio is not highly

277
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
sophisticated but it completely and

278
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,560
utterly

279
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
shut down their network

280
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,079
and one of the reasons that the

281
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,040
complacency is the enemy of cyber

282
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
security

283
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
is ncsc had given

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
europeans a warning about six months

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
before this happened saying that we

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
detected trick bought in the system

287
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,959
if you don't know what trigbot is it's a

288
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,240
thing that sits in your network

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
basically steals all your data steals

290
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
all your passwords in plain text and it

291
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
had been there for six months and they

292
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
did nothing about it then they got hit

293
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
by ryok

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
as it says there the um they paid a

295
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
ransom fee nobody

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
they've never revealed publicly what

297
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
their answer fee is i can't because i

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,079
learned it within the confines of a

299
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,839
secure environment

300
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,120
um but it was a lot of money

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
uh hackney council another one of my

302
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
investigations cost them 10 million that

303
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
that was the upfront cost what that

304
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
hidden cost this was a council that

305
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
couldn't pay their employees couldn't

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
provide school meals because they had no

307
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
system

308
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
red car another council cost them 10.4

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,639
million

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,399
but i don't think we should really

311
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,959
should look at this as just costs

312
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
because yeah it's gonna cost you

313
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
but there's a human cost as well um

314
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
masco was a number of colleges that were

315
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
hit with ransomware attacks and

316
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
basically on gcs

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
sorry gcse results day

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
they couldn't tell the pupils what the

319
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
results were

320
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
because the systems were down

321
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
they were linked to

322
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
another school through the same it

323
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
provider and

324
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
the admin for both ads had the same

325
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,279
password

326
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
um

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
and it's

328
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
it's the length of time it takes to get

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
back up and running um i think you

330
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
probably all know that the one of the

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
first thing riot does

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
is it looks for everything that could

333
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
have an extension that means it's a

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,600
backup and if it can see it it encrypts

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
it

336
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
so if you've got completely offline

337
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
backups and you can restore excellent

338
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
kudos

339
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
um my experience tells me because i've

340
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
seen companies do it is it takes a long

341
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
time

342
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,639
the europeans won was more than a year

343
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,320
before they were back back up and

344
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,279
running

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
and they paid the ransom

346
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
um yeah there is reputational damage you

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
just need to ask sophos about that one

348
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
so what do assets want to do um because

349
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,600
my time is coming to an end

350
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
we want to work with the industry in the

351
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,200
wider community to understand this

352
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,639
threat

353
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,600
um i have head through the grapevine in

354
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
the back door but i can't actually

355
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
bottom this out but i'm pretty sure that

356
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
last year there was a phishing attack on

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
a major entity on ireland that tried to

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
exploit the log full shell

359
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,120
so anybody here think that would have

360
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
been good information to have been

361
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
shared with you

362
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
so um i want to work more about

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,079
understanding the threat as i said

364
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,519
before you only understand the

365
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
weaponization you almost understand the

366
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,320
threat if you understand weaponization

367
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,519
um i have muted this to james and others

368
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,600
um we are in a very vulnerable position

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,839
being on an

370
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,240
island and um and i think it's ashley

371
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
said yesterday

372
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
the um

373
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
if you're a big company and you have a

374
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
major ransomware attack you're probably

375
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
going to have to call in a cir company

376
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
simply because they've got the expertise

377
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
to

378
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
fully restore your networks and more

379
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,959
importantly get rid of persistence

380
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
but what would happen is that would take

381
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
a bit of time if there was a major

382
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,519
attack on some of the critical

383
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,880
critical infrastructure on cayman

384
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
who would respond so i mute the idea

385
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,600
about people coming together to form a

386
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,199
community uh

387
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
cyber security incident response team to

388
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
try to do that stuff um so i'm putting

389
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,760
that one out there

390
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,000
and carries more reporting of incidents

391
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
not a lot comes into us i'll be honest

392
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
investigated one ransomware attack last

393
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
year

394
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
but the rest of it we pick up through

395
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
social media ourselves or people phoning

396
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
stuff in i would encourage more people

397
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,000
to get involved with us

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
together we can beat crime i'm not that

399
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
naive particularly cybercrime i doubt

400
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
that but we can target hard and as and

401
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
as part of that can we work together

402
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,880
let's not be complacent

403
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
um and that's my email address please

404
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
write it down and contact me if you've

405
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,399
got any questions any desires i'm really

406
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,040
keen to move this on i think james is as

407
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
well um and i know rj's came to get

408
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
involved as well

409
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
let's do what we can to protect the

410
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
cayman islands from significant attacks

411
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
because hopefully i've shown how

412
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
devastating they can be

413
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,639
um i wanted to have questions if you

414
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,160
