of girl

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
obviously naturally i would present on

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
social media

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
so naturally

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
um we all know it we all enjoy it

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
sometimes

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
persons more than others but in this

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
time of prioritizing risks

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
where does your social media posture

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
stand

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
so love it or hate it social media has

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,600
become a pillar in our lives today

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
social media world has become just that

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
right its own world

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
some people create different personas

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
for their online presence

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
some people create

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,920
a more outgoing personality some people

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
will be a business or even something

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
like an animal

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
right it's never really it's almost like

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
this never-ending game of grown-ups

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
playing pretend

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
but that doesn't mean it's all fun and

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
games right social media can have its

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
perks and you can build real connections

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
with people or gain new skills or you

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
can even sustain that business

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
social media really is its own world and

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
because of this we must assess what it

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
means to safeguard ourselves in all

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
aspects just as we would safeguard

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
ourselves your wealth and your family in

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
the physical world

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,319
your online presence grows every day

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,800
or changes every day with every click

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
just as your physical being grows and

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
changes every day

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
social media can be used against you or

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,560
your business and you may question your

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
privacy while others take advantage of

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
your publicly available data social

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,800
media will live amongst us for the

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
foreseeable time to come so we must

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
consider more seriously the impacts of

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
the secondary universe as it affects

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
ourselves our friends our family our

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
children and especially our future

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
now there are of course the traditional

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
threats of malware present on social

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,159
media but

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
where isn't their malware nowadays

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
and so i won't be focusing on that today

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
instead i would like to emphasize the

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
risk to you and your person

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
so

88
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
personal privacy has become a big topic

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,959
in recent years

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
when social networks were first formed

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,560
everyone was all about sharing

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
everything that they could

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,599
people post about how they're feeling

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,840
towards a certain situation or they post

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
about where they are in that moment and

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
who they're with

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
many people still post this revealing

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
information on daily social media posts

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
there's actually this entire realm of

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
social media influencers

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
that profit from sharing such

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
experiences with their social networks

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
and those are some big followings

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
we can become invested in their lives

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
and we feel that we can relate to their

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
experiences or find similarities in

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
different scenarios

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
and this may very well be beneficial to

109
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
us as a coping mechanism or something

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
that we can help navigate a situation

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
that is being experienced

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
however often times you will see and

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
hear about those same influencers

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,040
speaking on privacy or actually its lack

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080
thereof

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
they may feel invaded when out in public

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
or just express that they are sharing

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
very personal details with what could be

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
millions of people online

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
furthermore information privacy has also

121
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,000
become a topic of interest within social

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
networks

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
persons are becoming more skeptical

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
about what permissions are granted to

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
apps on their phones and what apps have

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
access to what other areas of their

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
phone such as messages or the camera

128
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
but ultimately most people will give in

129
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
and just accept without really reading

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
the fine print they just want to get

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
what's best out of the app the best

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
experience even if that means something

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
suspicious

134
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
that is until they find out that their

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
information is being sold or it's

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
involved in a breach or ironically they

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,000
usually found out find out these things

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
through other social media posts

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
these scenarios must now be treated more

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
seriously as legislation is created for

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
digital privacy and data protection

142
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
for example gdpr seeks to protect the

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
personal information of all eu citizens

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
whether they're residing in the eu or

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,759
not

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
social media platforms collect vast

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
amounts of personal information about

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
its users and these users expect that

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,400
their information will be safe and

150
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
protected and that they can choose what

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
is visible to others on their platform

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,759
from their profile security settings

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
however consideration must also be given

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
to potential data breaches

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
social media accounts are often targeted

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
by attackers and if they get lucky that

157
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
information or sometimes even that same

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
password can be used for more critical

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
accounts like online banking

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,880
we're also seeing similar laws being

161
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
proposed for reasons of online safety

162
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
most recently for example are the

163
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
digital services act and the digital

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,600
market act which seek to provide us

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
safer digital online space

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
these new rules aim to instill more

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
responsibility within online service

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,319
providers and create a level playing

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
field for competition

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
as more companies seek to strengthen

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
their online presence and offerings

172
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
these types of policies will become more

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
prevalent

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479
your business must be able to identify

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
its compliance requirements and ensure

176
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
that safe and ensure safety for its

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
customers as it develops

178
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,800
on the contrary there's also legislation

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,759
that's been

180
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
in effect since the beginning of the

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
digital boom such as the child online

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
privacy protection act

183
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
this rule was designed to protect

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
children under the age of 13 by placing

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
control over their information into the

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
hands of their parents

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
you know those annoying little pop-up

188
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
messages that like take the box and

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,039
acknowledge that you're over a certain

190
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
age yeah

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
we knew and we still know and we also

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,319
continue to acknowledge that the digital

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
world requires regulation but enforcing

194
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
it can always be a tricky task

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
how do you know that that user is really

196
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
over the age of 18.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
the security and privacy risks

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,080
associated with social media still is

199
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,720
this sort of gray area for users and

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
businesses alike for now however these

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
rules and more to come or be amended

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,960
will continue to drive the

203
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
administration of online platforms and

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
it's definitely something that we should

205
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,479
keep in mind as we continue to grow into

206
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,840
this new digital age

207
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
another topic that has been brought to

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
the forefront recently is cyber warfare

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,560
with countries and businesses seeing

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
more and more digital transformation

211
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
this threat has become very real

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
for example the invasion of ukraine has

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
created much fear around expected cyber

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
attacks across the globe and whether in

215
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
retaliation or in support it's almost

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
mutually assured destruction and let's

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
make no mistake cyber warfare is just as

218
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
lethal as physical war

219
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
and social media plays a big role here

220
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
as well

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
organized crime units are taken to

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,080
social media for recruitment after all

223
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
who better to target than young

224
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
adolescent minds

225
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,639
there are anonymous chat rooms that

226
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
young adults can join to interact

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
persons around the world without having

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
to download software or even use a

229
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,479
credit card

230
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
however before they know it these

231
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
individuals become invested in a group

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
or someone they meet with ulterior

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,120
motives

234
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
terrorist groups sometimes practice

235
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
culture jamming or political jamming to

236
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
popularize pro-terrorist messages and

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,640
social media users become attracted to

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
these messages by the perception that

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
they're facetious

240
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
it's very easy to forward a meme to a

241
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
friend or pass it along to someone else

242
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
who then pass it along to someone else

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,720
and soon enough it's gone viral

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,399
this flow of communication can then give

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
extremist groups more attention and

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
influence as they use social media to

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,160
display their beliefs and ideologies or

248
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,920
other messages and content about the

249
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
activities

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
war mongering and other political

251
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
tactics such as propaganda fuel the

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
disputes and can even create more

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
attention

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
very soon the threats become real and

255
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
people become engulfed in these radical

256
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
movements

257
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
the answer then

258
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
is to filter social media

259
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
many platforms will have policies and

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
procedures in place for when its

261
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
providers are allowed to remove a user's

262
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
content or deactivate a user's account

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,800
if found in violation however this is

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
solely at the discretion of the social

265
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,000
media company

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
many times you will hear of news of

267
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
someone complaining that inappropriate

268
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
content was not taken down quickly

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
enough or has caused

270
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,519
or damaged the reputation of someone or

271
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,959
something

272
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
this content and repercussions can have

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
lasting damaging effects on persons and

274
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
businesses

275
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
however legislators can find it

276
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,519
difficult to enforce administration for

277
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
the fear of infringement of rights such

278
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
as freedom of speech

279
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,600
nonetheless as we become dependent on

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
these digital on this digital realm we

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
will start to see more legislation and

282
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,959
regulation

283
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,640
as its consequences see physical results

284
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
influence from information on social

285
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
media can have a profound effect

286
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
within your your physical life

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,959
what you read online does affect you in

288
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
some way whether that be consciously or

289
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,839
not

290
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
and social influence can affect the way

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
we approach situations the way we view

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
ourselves or even the way we treat

293
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
others based on what we've seen heard or

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
read

295
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,519
pew research published a study in 2021

296
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,120
stating that about one third of all

297
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
americans receive news updates via

298
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
social media

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,640
i'm sure that percentage stays pretty

300
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
close here and came on with paper-based

301
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,360
news taking a hit in 2020

302
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
social media is full of information

303
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,600
whether that information is based on

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
facts or opinions becomes harder to

305
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
decipher when reading an online post

306
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
there are many forms of news outlets

307
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
online and it can be difficult to keep

308
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,360
track of the facts or premise

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
with more and more people looking online

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
to find the latest updates on what's

311
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
happening around them and around the

312
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
world the threat of activism is also

313
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
heightened

314
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
declassified reports from the u.s

315
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,079
national intelligence council speak to

316
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
russian state-sponsored groups attempts

317
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,839
to influence the 2020 presidential

318
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
election as well as the attempts to gain

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
unauthorized access to elections

320
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,079
infrastructure in 2016.

321
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,760
iran and china are also mentioned in the

322
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
report as well as several other foreign

323
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
actors for attempts to influence the

324
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
election outcome

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
in 2020 facebook issued a statement

326
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
regarding the company's action to curb

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
these attempts by dismantling a network

328
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
of fake russian accounts from the

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
platform

330
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
in a similar politically driven agenda

331
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,519
data from social media platform parlor

332
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
was extracted and publicized to expose

333
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
persons involved in the riot that took

334
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,279
place at the u.s capitol building in

335
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
january 2021

336
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,519
hacktivists can have many motives but

337
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
each one will think that their cause is

338
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,240
righteous

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
the social implications and reputational

340
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
damage that can result from a hack to

341
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
this attack are far-reaching

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
social platforms and corporate

343
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
businesses must ensure that the health

344
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
protection mechanisms in place to

345
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,279
circumvent these types of attacks as

346
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,000
well as protect the ram

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
apart from malicious external threat

348
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
actors social media also imposes a

349
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
higher level of insider threat unless

350
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
the platform is one like linkedin most

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
employee social media accounts

352
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
will not be know not be shown to be

353
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
connected to a business

354
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
however your employees sometimes need to

355
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
have access to sensitive data in order

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
to perform their job functions

357
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
and that data can pretty easily be

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
leaked in something such as a series of

359
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,920
280 character limit posts and it would

360
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
probably be difficult to track down or

361
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
even become aware of especially if the

362
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
threat actor took steps to master

363
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
identity here again the reputational

364
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
damage can be most impactful

365
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
alternatively the breach could be

366
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
unintentional social media encourages

367
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
information sharing but sometimes you

368
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
can share a bit too much

369
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
improper disclosure of financial data or

370
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
simply overkill on post can be damaging

371
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
just as damaging to your brand

372
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
social media can also be a space useful

373
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,839
to digital forensic investigators with

374
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,600
its myriad of data and most of which

375
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
being open source are publicly available

376
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
the evidence derived from these

377
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
platforms can be very valuable

378
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
tomorrow we'll be hearing from mr john

379
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
watson from the rcips digital forensic

380
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,360
and cybercrime unit mr welcome helped me

381
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
gain a deeper understanding of the

382
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,399
considerations surrounding using social

383
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
media data during investigations

384
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,000
so firstly digital crimes can be

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
categorized into two distinct areas

386
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,279
their cyber cyber enabled crimes are

387
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,959
those where the computer is used during

388
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
the act of the crime think of something

389
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
like fraud

390
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
on the other hand cyber dependent crimes

391
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
are those that can only be committed

392
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,600
using a computer such as data theft

393
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,519
digital forensic investigations can be

394
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
conducted to discover evidence in either

395
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
case however the evidence is usually

396
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
supplementary

397
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
there are many unclear lines that exist

398
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
around data privacy issues and using

399
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,440
social media data however evidence such

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,279
as time stamps and gps check-in

401
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
locations can be helpful to a case when

402
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
building a timeline for a crime but

403
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
these must be proven to be related

404
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
the check-in only means that the device

405
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,760
was present but evidence must be given

406
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
to link the device the event and the

407
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,839
person

408
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
the most recent and perhaps the most

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
notable case within the cayman islands

410
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
was the conviction of freddie diaz for

411
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
child pornography charges

412
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,160
his defense was trying to prove that he

413
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
was not the one downloading response

414
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
downloading these images um on his

415
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
devices and instead someone else had had

416
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,199
used his device to download them

417
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,120
rc ips was alerted to the case by

418
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
american law enforcement agencies

419
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
and here's a case where we can see

420
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
multiple data sources being used to

421
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,399
correlate that evidence

422
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,000
in fact earlier this week came out new

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
service reported that the crown would

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
seek a blanket ban for preventing mr

425
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
diaz from accessing the internet at all

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,519
it'll be interesting to watch this

427
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
unfold as a person who made

428
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
as for him as a person who made a living

429
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
from creating social media content

430
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
it must be noted however that in most

431
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
digital forensic investigations the

432
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
victim of the crime is usually

433
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,199
the one who has to make the report

434
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
before investigative action can be taken

435
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
other concerns around utilizing this

436
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
type of data include knowledge and

437
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,000
expense requirements

438
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
however

439
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
unfortunately if you're ever hit by a

440
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
major attack many organizations would

441
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
need to employ a cyber incident response

442
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,279
company to assist in remediation and

443
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
recovery efforts

444
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
these services can become

445
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
very costly very quickly

446
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
the latest cost of a data breach report

447
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
by ibm and the pondman institute say the

448
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,519
average cost has increased

449
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,240
10 from 2019 to us 4.24

450
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
million

451
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,600
furthermore we must also consider those

452
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
ethical concerns

453
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
there's a certain there are certain

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,399
rules of engagement that must surround

455
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
for example undercover police operations

456
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,480
being conducted via social media but

457
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
also moral concerns regarding such

458
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
operations will impact privacy concerns

459
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,199
as this surveillance is another great

460
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
area for authorities

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
much like cyber trends it's a constant

462
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
game of playing catch-up and as we learn

463
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
we continue to learn more as we to best

464
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,759
develop

465
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
how to utilize social media data in

466
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,399
investigations

467
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
so we're going to split the switch

468
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,519
a little and talk about the bright side

469
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,800
of social media and how it can be

470
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,320
beneficial to you

471
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
so we've spoken about social media being

472
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,199
used as an as a way to access news

473
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
this can be beneficial to persons who

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
aren't able to gather information via

475
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
conventional methods and perhaps people

476
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
are now consuming more information

477
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
without intentionally seeking out that

478
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,959
information

479
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,639
scrolling on social media can expose

480
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,639
persons to new information and even new

481
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,839
opportunities that may not have

482
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,839
otherwise been discovered

483
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,320
information is king so take advantage of

484
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,639
what you can as long as you can

485
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
and as long as you can verify its

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,519
accuracy to the appropriate accident

487
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,959
of course social networks are great for

488
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,320
building social

489
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
networks

490
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,160
we all have experience in its the who

491
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
you know circumstance so social media is

492
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,760
a great place for staying connected with

493
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,599
persons all over the globe

494
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
we can create a space for bonding with

495
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,799
persons we would not have otherwise been

496
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
able to engage with and you can create

497
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
real relationships with social benefits

498
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,919
social media platforms also create

499
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,160
learning programs linkedin learning has

500
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
become quite popular for quick courses

501
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
on a variety of topics including

502
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,839
management skills technical knowledge or

503
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,919
even basic word and excel training for

504
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,960
beginners

505
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
traditional classrooms can even can use

506
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
social media benefits as well such as

507
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
for submitting coursework maybe for

508
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
uh like a video essay on instagram or

509
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,919
youtube and class discussion forums on

510
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
spaces such as twitter there are

511
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
positive lights that can blossom from

512
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
these information hubs so we should

513
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
treat them

514
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
just as they are

515
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
and now that we've heard me talk about

516
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
all the considerations and implications

517
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
that continue to grow around social

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,039
media

519
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,120
what can we do about it

520
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,600
these are a few tips from myself and mr

521
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
watson on how you can safeguard yourself

522
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,440
on

523
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,520
within social media

524
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,320
so review your security profile settings

525
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
regularly

526
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,799
privacy

527
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,160
policies and settings are always

528
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,919
changing with every update and be sure

529
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,280
to double check what you're allowing on

530
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
your profile every now and then

531
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
sometimes something may be implicitly

532
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
allowed until you manually turn it off

533
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,240
and of course use protection mechanisms

534
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
such as two-factor authentication and

535
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
strong passwords for all accounts

536
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,039
limit your exposure

537
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,520
limit your post try not to delve too

538
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
deep into the pressure of posting

539
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
everything and anything that you find

540
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,679
interesting

541
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
keep some aspects of your life private

542
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
companies should have policies around

543
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
what can be shared on social media

544
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
platforms including an appropriate

545
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
authorization procedure

546
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,559
limit your personal information this

547
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
applies to both profile settings as well

548
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
as in your posts

549
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,840
try to limit personal details that can

550
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
be used against you in social

551
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
engineering attacks

552
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
limit the amount of information that can

553
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,799
be used to identify you and be skeptical

554
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,760
about

555
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
when you're required to input any of

556
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,960
that type of information

557
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
do a quick check does the link look

558
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
suspicious use techniques that you would

559
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
sniff out for phishing the same the same

560
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
ones can be applied here

561
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
interact only with familiar persons and

562
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,799
don't accept requests from persons that

563
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,440
seem that they have a suspicious profile

564
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
chances are your instincts are right and

565
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,520
people create fake profiles all the time

566
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
for malicious tasks

567
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
you can also look into fraud detection

568
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
services for companies you know such as

569
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
netcraft for castle and this may be

570
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
helpful to you and your business for

571
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,960
potential farming or other attacks that

572
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
can harm the reputation of your business

573
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,240
and these are just some of my references

574
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,039
so in all social media is a scary

575
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
comforting sharing exposing world

576
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
but it's here for the long run so

577
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
embrace it adopt or don't keep your

578
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
business safe by practicing good hygiene

579
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
and keep up to date with regulations

580
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,240
protect yourselves and have fun

581
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,290
[Applause]

582
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
