00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
somebody was going to have to read that

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
out i might have been more kind to them

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
but jane did such an amazing job thank

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
this is called show me the money this is

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
getting business buy-in to secure your

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
organization a lot of the talks that

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
you've heard this weekend or this week

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
and and that you'll hear in the lock

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
note this afternoon are

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,119
more geared towards larger organizations

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,399
i'm going to tell you a little bit more

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,640
about securing smaller organizations

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,520
that's my mug with my mug i am a virtual

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,479
cso with fractional cso

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
we help small to mid-sized companies

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,200
build out cyber security and compliance

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
programs the way that our model works is

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
that usually a company 50 to 150 people

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
are coming to us

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
they want to get a sock to compliance

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
often the driving factor there is

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,959
they're trying to sell to larger

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
companies that are asking for sock 2

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
compliance

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,959
and we help them build that out before

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
they're ready to hire a full-time cso we

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
assume that if we do our job very well

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
we will be there fractional ciso for

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
about three to five years at which point

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
we will help them

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
hire their first full-time cso or head

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,800
of security at which point we should

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
have built a good enough cyber security

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
program that that person can actually

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,000
focus on building the security team

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
rather than getting the fundamentals

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
done

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
uh i like myself so i'm going to tell

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
you about me i'm pretty awesome

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
these are some of the logos of companies

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
i have worked for in silicon valley

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
netgear

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
my history is actually in doing

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
large-scale content management systems

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
so if you go to support.netgear.com

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
i originally did that website

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
uh help.netflix.com

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
i also did their help center i advised

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
facebook on their help center and so my

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
history is in something called knowledge

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
strategy that's getting information

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
flowing through a company

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
out to partners and customers in an

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
efficient and cost-effective manner

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
those help centers with netgear for

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,280
example

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,760
a phone call for netgear support at the

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
time was costing 18 a call

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
they were getting 42 000 calls a month

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
and by redoing their support website i

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
was able to get that down to

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,319
um

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,440
24 000 calls a month at a savings of

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
eighteen dollars per call so it's very

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
cost effective it's very easy to prove

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
the roi

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
on on that kind of situation

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
same thing with netflix of course they

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,159
don't have you could not and still to my

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
knowledge cannot call netflix for help

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,599
but

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
they have their application runs on at

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,519
the time

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,239
nearly 900 different devices they were

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
very concerned how do we support

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
our call centers and how to do art we

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,959
support our customers and supporting

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
themselves with a knowledge base or a

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
help center

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
a very different kind of structure and

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
you have to think about from that

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
perspective what can the customer do

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
there are four things a netflix customer

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
can do on those 900 devices

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759
they can

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,280
stop and restart the movie or show

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
they're watching they can stop and

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,520
restart the application they can stop

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,880
and restart

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
the device that they're on

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
and then they can

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
reach out to netflix those are the four

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,080
options and at the time you could only

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
reach out to netflix via email they were

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
implementing chat at the time

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
very cost effective solution for for

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
helping those uh those folks

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
eventually facebook was a short contract

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
but i i went from facebook to fireeye i

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
went to fireeye on a six-week contract

130
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
all i had to do

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
was help them break a stalemate

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
internally on choosing their content

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
management system and their

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
collaboration platform their communities

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
at that point

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,080
six-week contract i had it done in two i

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
sat around because i'm very good at

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
architecture i helped determine here are

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
your needs for sso here are needs for

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
federated search here all of your

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
infrastructure that you don't have has a

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
300 person company at the time by the

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,440
end of the year i came in to fireeye

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
april of uh 2013 by the end of that year

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,120
they were 1200 people and in january of

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,759
2014 they bought mandiant i was a part

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,360
of that m a

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
so

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
so that's kind of how i got into

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
security just to give you a little

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,080
states i don't know how that equates

172
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
here in the cayman islands

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
i ended up at a public school north

174
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
carolina state university wolfpack i

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
graduated with a degree in textile

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
chemistry

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
i was a research chemist for eight

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
months after that i had put myself

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
through school doing that web

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
development which is how i ended up

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,840
later in those content management

182
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,000
systems but what that gave me that

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
continues to serve me very well other

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,319
than knowing how to wash my clothes that

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
degree in textiles chemistry

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
textiles understands that

187
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
your clothing your furniture your fabric

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
in your home

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
evokes an emotional response and that

190
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,120
all has changes in your response to that

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
fabric has to be mapped back

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
to not just the fabric itself but to the

193
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
yarn the fabric's made of to the dyes

194
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
and finishes that went into the yarn all

195
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
the way back to the fiber that's grown

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,880
in

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
a cotton field somewhere in alabama so

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
it gives you a really what i got from

199
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
that was just a really good sense of

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,520
holistic

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
systems and looking at that from a

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
consumer point of view

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
i eventually because i was so good with

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
netgear and netflix and i was so good at

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
building those large-scale content

206
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
management systems and so good with

207
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
those knowledge bases

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
i wanted to understand why it was so

209
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
good and i my degree my master's degree

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,879
from columbia university in new york is

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
in something called information and

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,759
knowledge strategy

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,550
you hear

214
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,759
[Music]

215
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,800
people processes technology a lot

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,039
in the security industry

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,639
that is knowledge strategy at its core

218
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
information security cyber security we

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,199
are knowledge intensive industry

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
highly recommend picking up some books

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
on knowledge strategy if you want to

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
really be effective

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
in cyber security

224
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,199
i joined fractional cso last year

225
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
last july

226
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
i've been having a very good time there

227
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
they've been

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
very giving with the mugs i'm enjoying

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
it um but you can see me you can find me

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,559

so

236
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,440
show me the money i want to give you a

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
little context on why i developed this

238
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
particular talk

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
in the united states pre-covered as of

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
2016 there were 5.6 million

241
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,320
employer firms that were under

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
well

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
sorry 5.6 million businesses in the

244
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
united states

245
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,200
99.7 of which have less than 500

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
employees

247
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,000
the majority of those have less than 100

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
employees but we hear from that upper

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
crust those enterprises that can really

250
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
afford to do security effectively at

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,560
scale

252
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
very valuable really doesn't apply to

253
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,120
99.7 of the businesses in america

254
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
i imagine it's very comparable here in

255
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
in the cayman islands you have a very

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,000
small set of very large enterprise

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
companies that can afford to do security

258
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
well

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
you you

260
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,120
hear from them a lot they don't apply to

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
most of your business models

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,399
i think it's

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
very important that we hear from those

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
security vendors and from the

265
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
enterprises that can do security at

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
scale it brings security and has in the

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
last 10 years certainly

268
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
brought security into a mainstream

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,399
conversation and now we're starting to

270
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
see some of the effects of that in the

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
small and midsize business market

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
and here we go knowledge strategy people

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
processes technology at the center of

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
that lives the data that we his

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
information security professionals need

276
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
to protect

277
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
uh unless you're with a hospital system

278
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
then you have lives in that

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
lives and data in that center

280
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
overlap

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
the security vendor is one as focused on

282
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,519
the technology because they want to sell

283
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
us the technology it's they need us to

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
believe that that technology is going to

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
solve all of our problems but the

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
reality is that technology solves a very

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
small amount of our problems because the

288
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
majority of our problems live in the

289
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
people and process side so this

290
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
conversation today

291
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
i'm going to assume that you either know

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
technology or have technology or can't

293
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,320
afford technology so we're not going to

294
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
talk about technology

295
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,360
we're going to talk about people and

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
processes that drive good cyber security

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,839
programs for small to mid-sized

298
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,320
businesses this does translate to larger

299
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
organizations as well

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,279
but more importantly what you don't see

301
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
on the slide we're going to talk about

302
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,240
the money aspect of this

303
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
we'll start with the people lens

304
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
everyone feeling good i'm seeing awake

305
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,279
people this is great i appreciate it

306
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
people

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,079
i have three mantras that i live by

308
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
whether i was in i.t operations support

309
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
operations through security operations

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,640
and that first mantra is

311
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
you are not your average customer

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
your customer doesn't care about

313
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,920
security that is not their job they've

314
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,399
been hired by your company to be very

315
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
good at accounting or marketing or

316
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
something else

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,279
so

318
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
you as a security professional already

319
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,680
are not your average customer if you

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,680
were you would not be doing security

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
you cannot succeed until others in your

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
organization are invested in your

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
success

324
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
there is no good way to roll out a

325
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
security program and not involve your

326
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
internal customers you can't do it and

327
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
expect it to be successful

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,079
well we can talk about that more in a

329
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,839
little bit

330
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,680
but more importantly

331
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
as you're rolling out your security

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
program

333
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,639
any friction that you introduce to

334
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
somebody else's process

335
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
is immediately an insurmountable

336
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
obstacle

337
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
any friction is an obstacle i cannot say

338
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
that enough over

339
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,959
25-ish 30 years in tech

340
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
i've seen so many multi-factor

341
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
authentication programs roll out in

342
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,320
companies from 40 people to 4 000 people

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,399
and half of them would fail

344
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,959
because you roll out this thing

345
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
and people will spend more time

346
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
figuring out a way around it

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
than just doing it because you have not

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,720
engaged them you've not made this a part

349
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440
of their process you've introduced

350
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
friction to their process and therefore

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
you've tried to give them an obstacle

352
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
that now they're pissed about

353
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
so in short none of this is about you

354
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
it's about your customer your internal

355
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,440
customer your external customer

356
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,839
not

357
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,160
you so you has a security professional

358
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
you need to understand and empathize

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
with your audience

360
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
what do your executives care about

361
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
they care about operational costs how

362
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
much is this going to cost me

363
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
that's fine

364
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
if they can plan for it

365
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,920
that's one thing it's when all of these

366
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
unexpected costs come up

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
that they get really cranky

368
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,760
risks are another really big thing that

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
your executive team cares about this is

370
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
anything that's going to put pressure on

371
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
your business

372
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
and may spur that spending above those

373
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
expected operational costs right

374
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
so risk

375
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,160
it still comes down to money

376
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,199
for your internal customers

377
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,079
it's different they want maximum return

378
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,720
for minimal effort when it comes to

379
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
their work so again

380
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,440
when you add friction to their processes

381
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
you make them do more work even if it's

382
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,160
an imaginary work even if it's two

383
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
seconds of multi-factor authentication

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
you have now interrupted their ability

385
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,040
to optimize their work

386
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,440
they want recognition they want to know

387
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
that they're doing a good job

388
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
historically cyber security has a bad

389
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,560
habit we're known as the team of no we

390
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
tend to shame people

391
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
we tend to put them down we still get

392
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
organizations sending out internal

393
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,000
phishing

394
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
you know

395
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
testing campaigns right

396
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
where they're promising bonuses and then

397
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
when people click on it firing them and

398
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
that is stupid

399
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
because you are eroding that trust and

400
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
you are not recognizing that this person

401
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,399
is an adult

402
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,279
that you have hired to do a job

403
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,199
that may not be as a security

404
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,399
professional

405
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
so shaming people

406
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
fundamentally does not work

407
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
what does work is thinking them i have

408
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
a former client a non-profit of about 80

409
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
people

410
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,959
didn't have a lot of money right but had

411
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
a really committed it team who were very

412
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
open to

413
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
talking and engaging with their internal

414
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
audience and what they would do in their

415
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,560
slack channel whenever somebody sent

416
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
them something that said hey i think

417
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,839
this might be like a phishing email

418
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
thing that you guys keep talking about

419
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
they would screenshot it they'd drop it

420
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
in the slack channel and go thanks bob

421
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
thanks sue you're absolutely correct

422
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
this is a legitimate phishing email

423
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
and that did two things it says to

424
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
everyone thank you you are part of my

425
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
process

426
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
i am involving you in my job you are

427
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
making me as a security professional

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,959
more successful thank you but it's also

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
saying hey folks

430
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
here's a phishing campaign that's active

431
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,079
right now and here's what it looks like

432
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,600
don't click on it

433
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
right

434
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
very simple

435
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
takes a couple extra minutes a day

436
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
very effective learning tool

437
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
and again success how do you become a

438
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,000
part of their success

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
that team did a really great job when

440
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,759
you were a part of my success as a

441
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
security professional

442
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,839
and i thank you publicly for making me

443
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
successful now you've just become a part

444
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
of my success

445
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,880
now you feel like i'm invested in your

446
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,199
success as well

447
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
anything that you do

448
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
that erodes that when i hear people call

449
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,160
their internal users

450
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,519
cow workers

451
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,880
you know or stupid users or the problem

452
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,320
exists between the keyboard and chair

453
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
pebcak

454
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
i get it

455
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
it's not their job to be security

456
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,000
professor professionals and when you say

457
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,439
 like that

458
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,679
you erode trust

459
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
and you make it clear to them that you

460
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
are not invested in their success in

461
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,439
their role

462
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,919
you cannot expect them to help you as a

463
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,679
security professional if you cannot

464
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
respect them for the reason that the

465
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
company hired them

466
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,199
i can harp on this all day

467
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,120
but we have a lot of other

468
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,039
topics to cover so

469
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,200
anyone who has a good example

470
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,799
or a question here jump up

471
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,240
all right i'm going to move on

472
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
people processes technology we're going

473
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,320
to talk about processes now

474
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
cyber security health model

475
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
i have a chapter in this book called

476
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,919
reinventing cyber security

477
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
you can download a pdf of this for free

478
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
from jupiter one's website they are a

479
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
vendor they were very kind and footed

480
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
the bill for this

481
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
in the u.s this is available for 10 off

482
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
of amazon

483
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
in there i go over

484
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,919
the cyber security health model the

485
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
reason i wrote this model and originally

486
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
i was calling it the maturity model and

487
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
i'll tell you a little bit more about

488
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,440
that in a moment

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
the reason i developed this model is

490
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
that i would go into a client and try to

491
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,559
talk about cyber security maturity

492
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,039
and their eyes would glaze over

493
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,320
and so i would pull out the nist

494
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
maturity model

495
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
and their eyes would glaze over

496
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,760
the nist maturity model is fantastic for

497
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
a security professional when you look at

498
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
that model you as a security

499
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
professional with some experience

500
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,039
understand what that model was trying to

501
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,000
convey to a business person that model

502
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
is completely meaningless so this

503
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
i wrote is very verbose but it's very

504
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
meaningful to a board

505
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
to a group of investors and to the

506
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
c-suite because they understand that

507
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
when i say hey

508
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
client

509
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
right now there is someone in your

510
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
organization who is trying their best to

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
do things in a secure way

512
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
but it's maybe one person

513
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200
and i need you to move over into this

514
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,960
middle column i need you to be either

515
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,520
team driven or compliance driven i need

516
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
a team to own

517
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
your security

518
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,640
and to drive that within your

519
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,559
organization and if you have enough

520
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
money

521
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
i want you over in that risk-based or

522
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,799
risk management informed column where

523
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,480
you're actually using your cyber

524
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
security information to make business

525
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,039
decisions

526
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,000
my clients are usually like i said sub

527
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,760
250 person organizations

528
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,559
i

529
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
usually see them coming in on that

530
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
grassroots or ad hoc side there's

531
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,400
somebody in there who has some vague

532
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,679
clue about security and they're trying

533
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,039
to do things in a secure way on the

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,600
technical side

535
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,960
maybe

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
they've got a compliance program maybe

537
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
they've done sock too and they're a

538
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
little bit more in that that middle

539
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,919
section

540
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,960
i don't expect any of my clients to be

541
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
on the right hand side of this model

542
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
until they are big enough making enough

543
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
money

544
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,799
to actually invest in security tooling

545
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,400
at 50 people

546
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
i'm not telling them to spend 200 000 a

547
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
year on security tooling unless they are

548
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
very well healed

549
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,640
that is not the majority of my clients

550
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
i take that model and i make a scale

551
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
and it's a one to five scale again

552
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,400
one is going to be that left hand side

553
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
three is the middle five is that right

554
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
hand side i want my clients to be a

555
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
three

556
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
so when i do the gap analysis with them

557
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
and we talk about how does a business

558
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
talk about security

559
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
you know

560
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,320
are you doing any kind of security

561
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,480
awareness and training do you know what

562
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
your compliance needs are

563
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
like i'm rating them on a one to five

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
scale

565
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
and then i'm giving that to the

566
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
leadership and saying here's where i

567
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
need you to be threes

568
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,280
i don't need them to be fives

569
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
and by saying by having shown them that

570
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
previous

571
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
model and now giving them this i'm

572
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,480
saying you're here i need you here and

573
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
i'm going to give you a path to get

574
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,320
there

575
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,919
all of those talking points are going to

576
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,480
be very consistent when i do

577
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,760
and i don't cover this in this

578
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
particular talk when i do secure

579
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
software development life cycle

580
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
assessments

581
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,640
same one to five scale

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
same cross-functional relationships

583
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
cyber security operations

584
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,960
and then we go a little bit more into

585
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
developer behavior

586
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
infrastructure for your development and

587
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
your your

588
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,799
production environments and then

589
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
the the security behavior your

590
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
application supports

591
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
once it's in production

592
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
this is a great

593
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
tool

594
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
for an early early

595
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
program

596
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
gives you some sense of metrics

597
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
of okay

598
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,480
we want

599
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,039
to be a three in compliance

600
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,200
well you know maybe we need to hire a

601
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
compliance person and maybe we need to

602
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,559
invest 30 000 a year in a compliance

603
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,039
platform like a vanta or a bike check or

604
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,559
something like that

605
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
drata there's lots of them out there

606
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,960
you can now tie

607
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
measurements

608
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
to outcomes of some sort i if i spend

609
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
thirty thousand dollars here

610
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,840
i expect to go from a two to three there

611
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,919
and that's really valuable when you're a

612
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
very small organization because you

613
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
can't buy for security tooling until you

614
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,559
have some kind of metrics saying

615
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,480
you need this security tool

616
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,440
right

617
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
so if you have

618
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
no security tooling whatsoever this is a

619
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,679
great start

620
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,039
security roadmap

621
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,440
ideally and again you'll see

622
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
i'm using the same verbiage over and

623
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
over again business alignment awareness

624
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,679
and training compliance and audit

625
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
program and people development you know

626
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,760
program and people development if you

627
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
don't have a security team which

628
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,559
95 of my clients do not

629
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,159
this tells you

630
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,679
hey

631
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,760
great you're working with fractional cso

632
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
for the next 18 months

633
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
at some point we at fractional cso

634
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,640
expect you to actually hire

635
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,520
somebody internally who is dedicated to

636
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
security and we put that on their

637
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
roadmap

638
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
so leadership knows it's coming

639
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
i once posted an example security

640
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
roadmap on linkedin and i had a ciso say

641
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,120
attackers don't care about your roadmap

642
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
and i'm like you are absolutely correct

643
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,760
attackers give zero shits about your

644
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,200
roadmap but you know what your ceo cares

645
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
a lot

646
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
because they can't

647
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,880
budget for anything without this

648
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
and it doesn't have to be exactly this

649
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,039
format

650
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,400
maybe you've got

651
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,799
a format internally that you're already

652
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,840
using

653
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,799
ask

654
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,240
if you're not sure

655
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,440
ask

656
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
whatever it takes put something together

657
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
so you can say to your

658
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,679
leadership i'm one person i'm doing this

659
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,919
over here in order for us to do these

660
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,080
other things in order for us to get to

661
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
threes on that health check

662
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
i need to hire people in these spaces i

663
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,760
need tooling in that space here's how

664
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
much it's going to cost me

665
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
right here's how much it's going to cost

666
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
us to get from ones and twos to threes

667
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,320
across the board

668
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,159
all of these things that i'm going to

669
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,919
show you today i'll just take a quick

670
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,159
side note all of these things are

671
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,720
available has excel spreadsheets

672
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
they're under creative commons license

673
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
in my github you can download them you

674
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
can use them you can alter them to

675
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
whatever is meaningful to you you can

676
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
share them i don't care

677
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
do something

678
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
that helps you communicate to the

679
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
business

680
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
if these are not meaningful

681
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
figure something out

682
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
talk to me i'll help you

683
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,279
and before actually before i go too far

684
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,960
security health check security health

685
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
check

686
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
my

687
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
plugging shameless plug

688
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,440
my chapter in this anthology and this is

689
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
a great anthology of mostly women's

690
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
cyber security professionals

691
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
my chapter is literally called

692
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,440
security maturity let's call it security

693
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,279
health let's talk about security health

694
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
because maturity to a business person

695
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
implies that we only ever get better we

696
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,640
only ever get more mature we only ever

697
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,559
get more sophisticated and we know in

698
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,360
security that is not true

699
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,159
go back one more these driving factors

700
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,400
the likely change drivers here

701
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
there are things that push you back down

702
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
and make you less secure

703
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
if your executive leadership stops

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
caring about your security program i

705
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,600
guarantee you you are not going to be

706
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,000
five anymore

707
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
but what you're really here for

708
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
is the money lens

709
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,039
the money lends it's hard as security

710
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,799
professionals i think to talk about

711
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,240
money because

712
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,679
we just know

713
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,120
okay we have to spend a certain amount

714
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,080
of money on a certain amount of tooling

715
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,559
your organization has already decided

716
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,320
that it is worth it to them to spend

717
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
fifteen hundred dollars every three

718
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
years to buy everybody in the company a

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,799
macbook pro or a macbook air

720
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,559
your company has already decided that

721
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,320
it's worth twelve dollars per person per

722
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,760
head per month

723
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,559
to have gmail or microsoft office um

724
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,799
sorry microsoft 365 is this being called

725
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,679
down

726
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
because email is important that is no

727
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,360
longer a cost center that is a an

728
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,240
operational cost that is core to us

729
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,159
having to do business my people need an

730
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,039
email address my people need laptops you

731
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
need to be able to say

732
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
i need security to be a part of your

733
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,720
operating cost

734
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
instead of having people look at

735
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
security as a cost center

736
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
security is not about losing money

737
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,840
security is about

738
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,520
being core to the business function

739
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,880
i do this in a couple of different ways

740
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,600
when i'm talking to a an executive

741
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,080
for a simple project

742
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
an roi calculator

743
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
very simple i have 80 numbers

744
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
80 employees

745
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,600
um

746
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
how much time how much does that person

747
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,760
make per year how much time do i think i

748
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
can save them

749
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
in effort

750
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
and for a lot of security professionals

751
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
these numbers look imaginary

752
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
but to a cfo these numbers are very real

753
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
and they may not agree with the exact

754
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,559
numbers

755
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,399
but i've rarely had anyone in fact i've

756
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,520
never had a cfo change the formula

757
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,240
i've had them change okay well only

758
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,840
certain number of employees will

759
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,039
actually get

760
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,960
you know productivity out of this this

761
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,600
is

762
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,799
only additive for this roi you can't use

763
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,880
this to replace people with tooling

764
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,799
which you should not be doing anyway

765
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
your tooling should always be presented

766
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
to your leadership has

767
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,559
i need to use my existing team more

768
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,760
effectively and if i put this tooling in

769
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
i can free them up to do these other

770
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,760
initiatives

771
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,200
that is how you should be positioning

772
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
your security tooling

773
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,320
to your leadership this ties in at a

774
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,640
higher level when you get more people

775
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
and you're more enterprise driven to

776
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
automation now if i can spend x amount

777
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
of money automating things i can now

778
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,559
redirect my folks to focus their effort

779
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,039
on these other initiatives

780
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,679
so that's a very simple conversation

781
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,720
starter

782
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
to get a little more interesting

783
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,559
especially with

784
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,799
a cfo i like to talk about risk and

785
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,799
recovery estimates

786
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
i need that cfo to accept that there is

787
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
a cost

788
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,880
for not doing security if you are not

789
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,440
going to invest in security you need to

790
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
be aware that this is going to cost you

791
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,000
at some point that point may be in a

792
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,720
month that point point may be in a year

793
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
that point maybe in five or ten years

794
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,559
but at some point

795
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,440
your lack of attention your lack of

796
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,559
funding

797
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,039
to your security program is going to

798
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,360
cost you money

799
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
here i have incident response

800
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,240
calculations that not just cover and the

801
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,799
the incident response costs um come from

802
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,840
adrian sinabria and tennessee

803
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,200
it's not just about what your ir team if

804
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,440
you're big enough to have an ir team

805
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,399
it's not just what those people are are

806
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,720
spending in terms of effort because when

807
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,799
they are responding to an incident they

808
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,039
are not doing their day job ideally or

809
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,520
their ideal day job and that

810
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,000
productivity that loss in productivity

811
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,960
costs money in the cfo's head

812
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,520
i also want to make it clear that

813
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
if there is something that's impacting

814
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
your productivity across your

815
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
organization like a ransomware event

816
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,120
you're losing money because folks are

817
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,440
not able to do their job

818
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,480
and at what point does this number get

819
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,120
big enough that it shuts your company

820
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
down

821
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,880
and for a very small company that number

822
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,440
may be well under a million dollars it

823
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,880
may be under two hundred thousand

824
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,279
dollars

825
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,919
by taking this to your cfo and starting

826
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,840
a conversation

827
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,480
very helpful again i've never had a cfa

828
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
cfo push back and say i don't believe in

829
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
these numbers

830
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,919
maybe they've adjusted them but they've

831
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
not adjusted the formula underneath them

832
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,840
as a part of this

833
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,399
particular spreadsheet in my github

834
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,559
there are a couple of tabs that actually

835
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,519
have

836
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,799
um

837
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,200
uh kind of yearly information from like

838
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
the fbi sofo secure world on what

839
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,799
companies or costs what bec and

840
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,440
ransomware are costing companies so you

841
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
can say to your your cfo over here on

842
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,279
this tab you know the average vec is

843
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,000
costing a company 200 000 a year

844
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,320
and if you can get them to accept that

845
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
if they don't do security that one day

846
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
they're going to have to pay that 200

847
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
000

848
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,399
you can really get a lot more buy-in

849
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,720
come on

850
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,330
wherever

851
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,559
[Laughter]

852
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,640
and that those risk and recovery

853
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,880
estimates can also be used to determine

854
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,960
how much cyber insurance you need

855
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,559
because one of the biggest things that

856
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,640
my clients ask me is

857
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480
how do i know

858
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,640
if i've got enough cyber security

859
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
insurance and the answer is you never

860
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
have enough cyber insurance

861
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
insurance because

862
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
something always screws that up it's the

863
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,000
landscape is changing constantly but i

864
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,799
can get you in a ballpark so

865
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,360
if for example you are a service

866
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,440
provider of some sort and you have a

867
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
subscription service you've got seven

868
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
customers these are your subscriptions

869
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
this is just an example

870
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
this is your impact cost per day if

871
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
suddenly you are not able to deliver

872
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
services

873
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,159
that fifty three hundred dollars

874
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
multiplied by seven days

875
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,799
that is the minimum amount

876
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,399
of cyber security insurance that you

877
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,679
want

878
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,919
because i have to assume that if you get

879
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,760
ransomware and you can't deliver

880
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,399
services for seven days

881
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,320
that you're you're going to lose a lot

882
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,919
of those customers you may lose all of

883
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,000
those customers if you're only down for

884
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,799
four hours or a day

885
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
very high likelihood that 80 or more of

886
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,200
your customers will will come back or be

887
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,039
retained but you're still going to lose

888
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,039
some customers

889
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,720
but if you're down for a week or two

890
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,760
weeks

891
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
even if it if that number is not big

892
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
enough to kill the business as a whole

893
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,000
you have fundamentally

894
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,960
changed your revenue model

895
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,679
so

896
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,360
for a company like this

897
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,679
you know i shall i'll give you an actual

898
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,960
example i have an e-commerce customer

899
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
their revenue generated is six hundred

900
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
and fifty thousand dollars a day from

901
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
their e-commerce commerce website

902
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,000
multiply that by seven is 4.6 million

903
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,679
dollars

904
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,159
their cyber insurance was a million

905
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
dollars

906
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,320
i want their cyber insurance to be at

907
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
least five million dollars to cover that

908
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
four and a half million that they're out

909
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,799
ideally i want it to be 10 million

910
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,640
but that's a business decision because

911
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
for that particular customer getting a 5

912
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,960
million dollar policy was sixty thousand

913
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,639
dollars getting a ten million dollar

914
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
policies a hundred and thirty thousand

915
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,520
dollars

916
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
very big difference how do i wanna spend

917
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
that money

918
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,159
they chose to go with a five million

919
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
dollar policy but it also means now

920
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,280
they're aware that they may get hung out

921
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,399
to dry

922
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,040
if they have an incident big enough

923
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,320
that it's going to be more than 5

924
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,639
billion

925
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
i will say if you ever have to look at

926
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,440
cyber security insurance you will see

927
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,199
you know what you're insured for five

928
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,359
million is usually your cap maybe you're

929
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,719
insured for 250 000 for a wire transfer

930
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
maybe you're insured for you know a

931
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,199
million for fishing that may leads to

932
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,440
some major major incident

933
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,639
but you'll see

934
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,119
a retention

935
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,480
clause

936
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
of your

937
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,679
million dollars

938
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,839
a hundred thousand dollar retention

939
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,160
that's not like a deductible kind of

940
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
like a deductible not exactly in a

941
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
health insurance deductible in the

942
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
states at least

943
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,240
if my bill is five thousand dollars and

944
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
my deductible is a thousand dollars i

945
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,680
pay a thousand dollars the insurance

946
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,119
company pays for

947
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,720
in cyber insurance if my bill's a

948
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
million dollars and my retention's a

949
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,680
hundred thousand i pay a hundred

950
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
thousand

951
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
they don't pay until it's over a hundred

952
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
thousand

953
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
so if i have four incidents that are

954
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,920
right around a hundred thousand dollars

955
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
they don't pay for those you know right

956
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
so my first incident is 97 000 99 000

957
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,240
100 100 and 2 000 guess what i pay i pay

958
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
i pay a hundred thousand they pay one

959
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
thousand right

960
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,839
i i pay a hundred thousand they pay 2

961
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,839
000. that's what a retention is so it's

962
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,320
really important to dial in your cyber

963
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
insurance

964
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
i'm also going to pause here and talk

965
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
about why customers come to us not

966
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
trying to pitch my my service here i'm

967
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
trying to help you understand the

968
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,119
market's place

969
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,160
85 percent of my customers uh sub 250

970
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
person companies are coming to me

971
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
because a bigger company

972
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,680
one of their potential clients

973
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
is asking them for stock 2 compliance

974
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
great that's fantastic because now they

975
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
have tied security and compliance to

976
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,920
sales

977
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,520
that's great

978
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,320
if i can get everyone to put in their

979
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,440
crm

980
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,880
a sock to flag or a security flag where

981
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,640
not having security or not having talked

982
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
to has cost us a deal

983
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
it's very easy

984
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
to get that funding it's a lot easier to

985
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
get funding for security

986
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,440
and i've done that with clients

987
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
of the remaining clients that come to me

988
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
or prospects that come to me

989
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
i'd say

990
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,640
the majority of that 15 percent

991
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,599
is boards or investors saying hey you

992
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,839
need a security program fantastic

993
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,359
they're looking ahead

994
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,920
very small percentage one prospect can't

995
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
has come to me in the last year because

996
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,359
they had an incident

997
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,440
and i'll be honest i laughed because

998
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,119
when they told me what happened i

999
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,800
couldn't help myself i said how did you

1000
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,440
get breached and they said

1001
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,079
they compromised a a cold fusion 2012

1002
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,960
server

1003
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,119
this is in november right

1004
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,200
and i loved because in 2002 i was

1005
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,040
decommissioning cold fusion servers i

1006
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
didn't even know that cold fusion still

1007
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
had you know as around michelas had a

1008
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
2012 server that you're now still

1009
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,040
running and why are you running it in

1010
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
ec2 oh okay well you know we'll get

1011
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
there but i laughed and i was

1012
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
embarrassed because

1013
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,520
i'm supposed to treat people with

1014
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,440
empathy and this is prospect i might

1015
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,000
just lose a cell of all right

1016
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,960
um and the guy says no no it's fine i'm

1017
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,880
the new cto i've only been here three

1018
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,599
months this is what i'm inheriting

1019
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,280
honestly of all things that could have

1020
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,000
happened it turned out really well and

1021
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,680
they actually did come to us as a client

1022
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
tools and suggestions you don't have to

1023
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
spend money to get started if you're in

1024
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,480
a really small organization there's

1025
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
plenty of open source tools out there

1026
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
i'm sure you've heard of lots of

1027
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,440
suggestions over the course of the last

1028
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
two days as well

1029
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
security onion is one of my favorites

1030
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,839
the folks driving security onion are old

1031
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,920
school mandiant consultants some of the

1032
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
original gang

1033
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,920
the security onion is free they charge

1034
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,240
for for support basically although if

1035
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,599
you're in the community

1036
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,200
it's free you can just buy a support

1037
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
contract if you really want one fireeye

1038
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
which is now trellix used to have a page

1039
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
full of freeware i haven't gone to check

1040
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,040
and see if it's still there

1041
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,520
know before i'm not a fan of their stuff

1042
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
i'll be blunt but they've got free stuff

1043
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,200
um

1044
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,359

1045
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,280
