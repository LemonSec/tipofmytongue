continuity in the 21st century

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
thank you so much

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
let me first make sure my clicker works

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
here

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,640
haha it does okay great

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
back works too yeah we're going to be

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
talking about

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
disaster recovery we're going to be

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
talking about business continuity this

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
is already mentioned i did a lot of uh

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
consulting in my past i worked in

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
healthcare i worked in financial

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
services so i got to build these

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,400
programs and i got to advise folks in

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
these programs way way back in the early

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
2000s now i could say at the turn of the

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,079
century

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,680
which sounds much more impressive than

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
it felt at the time at the turn of the

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
century we're building disaster recovery

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,799
solutions

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
and uh and it's interesting because

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
20 years later it feels like we still

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
make some of the same mistakes so i'm

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
going to share some of those mistakes

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
and share some context now two decades

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,119
ago we didn't really have

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,960
good data we didn't really have good

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,079
insights

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,479
as to what made a program good or bad we

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
had some gut feel we had some expertise

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
we were like ah this this worked and

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
that didn't and oh that person seems to

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,239
be going okay and oh my goodness don't

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,440
talk to them

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
the week they've had right we had a lot

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
of those types of stories we didn't have

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,280
really good data so in this talk i'm

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
going to be referencing a uh survey that

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
uh cyansha did in partnership

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
with cisco so cyansha institute

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
does a lot of different security studies

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
fantastic analysis of data

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
they worked with cisco on a security

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
outcome study

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
effectively asking what works in

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,599
security right

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
reviewed around 5000 people double blind

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
so they didn't know us we didn't know

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,319
them

76
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,239
crunched the data and gave us some

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,519
results

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
and surprisingly business continuity and

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
disaster recovery jumped out of that

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
resilience jumped out of that we thought

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
you know what what people were doing

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,879
that would make a good security program

83
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
would be like cloud security or would be

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
like sassy or be zero trust would be

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
something cutting edge no no one of the

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
main drivers was

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,599
continuing zest or curry weird

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
weird for those of us who've been doing

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
it for a while and kind of feel like you

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,760
know we're the uh or the dowdy uh cousin

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
that no one wants to talk to it was a

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
little bit weird but yeah a little bit

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
reaffirming so i'm going to talk about

94
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,640
some of the data today

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
in uh and showing where we need to go

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
when we build our programs

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
first off first off in terms of like gut

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,879
checks all right

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,000
in

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
2016 2017 2018

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
um no one really thought there would be

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
a pandemic

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
the idea of like we should do pandemic

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,879
planning was something that people were

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
like really why why would we do that

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
like no but we should you know for for

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
continuity and recovery okay okay i'll

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,799
humor you

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
ah but no one really thought and no one

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
rules were engaged at the same time if

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
you remember like walking dead was

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
popular there were some things on

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
television people were we're finding fun

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
there's some good movies out there like

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
c nation um good and air quotes i mean

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,319
it's a popcorn movie we can debate

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,680
whether or not that was actually a good

118
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
movie but there were some movies about

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
that

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
and so what my team did was

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
we used the cdc the united states cdc

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358
zombie preparedness kit if you haven't

123
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,040
seen it it's it's kind of cool it

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
walks you through what happens if

125
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
there's a zombie outbreak and we thought

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,880
this is great i'm going to prepare folks

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
for the pandemic and we we built some

128
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
plans we did some table tops i'm a big

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
fan of table tops

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
get me in a room get me to tell them

131
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,680
some stories give me a good table

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,840
preferably with a nice top and some

133
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
coffee we're gonna have a good time so

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
when the panda happens when 2020 happens

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
i thought this is good this is my chance

136
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,639
i'm gonna reach out to some of the folks

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,759
i worked with

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,360
i'm gonna be like hey

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
what happened we did this zombie

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
preparedness kit and they're gonna be

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
like wolf you have no idea you saved us

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
and i'm gonna feel good about myself

143
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
right i'm gonna have some good case

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,880
studies we're gonna have some good

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,240
anecdotes that i could share one day

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
at besides cayman um however i'm

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
sorry to report

148
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
that wasn't the case i reached out to

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,639
folks i'm like you remember how did you

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
guys do you remember we did the zombie

151
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
thing we did the we we did the and

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
they're like oh yeah you know funny i

153
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
forgot about that

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,919
like you forgot

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
like well i was busy at the time people

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
were going home i didn't know what's

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,479
going on we figured it was two weeks

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
then it was two months i don't know and

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
to a person no one remembered the plan

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,080
and i think that

161
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
first was humbling because the kid i'd

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,039
spend a few years prior to joining cisco

163
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
working on this

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,199
but that also really in my mind

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,800
illuminated part of the problem with

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
continuity and recovery we all have

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
plans

168
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
we all have tabletops

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
and then something happens and it

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
doesn't work

171
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
so i'm going to talk through today how

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
to prepare how to get ready but i

173
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
encourage you guys please please please

174
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
put this in action in your organizations

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
test it keep it fresh because if it goes

176
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
too long

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
it's gone even if it's something as

178
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
exciting as fleeing zombies

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
it's gone

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,759
all right i'm going to talk about

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,160
continuity recovery in general i'm going

182
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
to delve into some common mistakes where

183
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
people go wrong including again

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
forgetting there's a plan and i'm going

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
to talk on part three about how to use

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,479
this

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
information strategically how to use

188
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
this information to do more than just

189
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,360
recover but to position the security

190
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,759
team to have good conversations with the

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
executive team

192
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
to get sponsorship and buy-in uh to

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
build better relationships with our

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
peers

195
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
so part one

196
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
continuity and recovery with cloud

197
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
services now

198
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
some things

199
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,639
of course haven't changed

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,520
in

201
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
the beginning of doing continuity

202
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
recovery if you're just getting into it

203
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,560
if you're wondering what to do you need

204
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
to do a business impact analysis what do

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
i have what it means we're going to talk

206
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
about that in in depth in this session

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,000
we need to protect against

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,199
uh impacts not just events a lot of good

209
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
planning is built around what happens if

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
it's a hurricane what happens if we lose

211
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
power what happens if there's an

212
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
adversary what happens if there's

213
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
malware and then the scenario comes down

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
and plays out it's not just like what we

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,919
thought it was a little bit to the left

216
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,360
a little bit to the right when i was in

217
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
the financial services our cfo used to

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
always ask me wolf

219
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
what happens if an asteroid falls from

220
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
the sky and takes out the data center

221
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
and i'd say peter

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
i would retire

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
i'd be done

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
if i'm not in that data center

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,800
but when we actually had an outage we

226
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,840
had planned so hard for a full down like

227
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
everything is down

228
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
that when things were partially down we

229
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
had corrupted data and services coming

230
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
up out of order and services trying to

231
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,960
talk back to the services that were

232
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
failing and the data center that was

233
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
affected it was really interesting to

234
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,240
see that how we had over optimized from

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
that scenario and it really

236
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,120
resulted in trouble getting back up so

237
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
it's important to think about the

238
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
impacts short term long term medium term

239
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
of things being done instead of over

240
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
focusing on events it's also important

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
to focus on a few proven strategies i'll

242
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
get to why that is uh in just a minute

243
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
now some things have changed

244
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
right um

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
two decades ago

246
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
we wouldn't all get to declare you know

247
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,640
a

248
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
international holiday when aws was off

249
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
at abs is down today what are we doing

250
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,120
we're playing video games

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
we're waiting

252
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
until they get back up and until the

253
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,720
services that rely on aws get back up

254
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
and then our services can come back up

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
right we didn't necessarily have that

256
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
idea

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
uh watson

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
um of ibm who not the watson mainframe

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
the the

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
watson who founded ibm who the mainframe

261
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
was named after once famously said

262
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
there's a market for maybe 10 to 50

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
computers in the world right he's like

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
no one wants a whole bunch of computers

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
and everyone laughed and we tout that

266
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
out again and again like ah he thought

267
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
they were going but we have so many more

268
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,839
computers but when you think about it

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
we're really down to like four main

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,959
computers these days right we're on

271
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,800
azure or aws or gcp we're really down to

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
this tight tight consolidation

273
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
which hadn't happened before so we have

274
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
that to contend with we also the fact

275
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
that a lot of assets are outside of our

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
controls

277
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
in the gold and olden days it was my

278
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
employee on my device sitting in my

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,760
office on my network talking to my data

280
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
center on an application that i

281
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,839
partially

282
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,680
wrote of course today that application

283
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
is probably sas if there is a data

284
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
center component that's infrastructure

285
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
as a service both outside of our

286
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
controls very few people are going to

287
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,519
office anymore very few people are even

288
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
on corporate owned equipment anymore

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
oftentimes it's byod so we've got a lot

290
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
of assets out of our control that we

291
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,160
need to take account for there's new

292
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
strategies that exist which i'll cover

293
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
and more and more

294
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
uh it's a team sport it can only be it

295
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
or can only be bit security who are

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
overseeing this especially when we have

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
supply chain issues

298
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
especially when we have devops teams

299
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
and sre teams

300
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
so some things have changed some things

301
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,440
haven't

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
when we talk about business impact

303
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,160
analysis

304
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
it's really where we need to start i

305
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
think this

306
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
is

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,839
the most underlooked aspect of blue team

308
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
the almost underlooked aspect of

309
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
organizational security what do we

310
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
actually have and what does it mean

311
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
and what does it mean from a business

312
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
process perspective right what is our

313
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
business process who's our key people

314
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,920
what technology are they using do they

315
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
have facility dependencies and what does

316
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,680
that data flow look like mapping those

317
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
things out

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
and then taking that data flow and

319
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,519
mapping out further into the enabling it

320
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,240
our ability as security professionals to

321
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
say any nut and bolt within a data

322
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
center any virtual instance with

323
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
infrastructure and service any dns and

324
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
ip address pairing in the cloud on a sas

325
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,279
application

326
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,440
what does that mean to my business

327
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
if i'm in the business of funds money

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,519
management should be about the funds

329
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,959
well in the business of manufacturing it

330
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
should be about the widgets

331
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
can we draw that line

332
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
i was telling you about how like the

333
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
some things have changed and some things

334
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,880
haven't one the genesis of this was i

335
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
was doing a business continuity and

336
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
disaster recovery exercise

337
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
for a

338
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
head hunting firm out of chicago

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,959
and so we're

340
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
top floor with chicago skyrise

341
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,519
beautiful view people are coming in from

342
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,240
different parts of the business

343
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
and uh and i was letting my uh

344
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
consulting team do most interviews i was

345
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
singing on it and we had positioned

346
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
ourselves with the window behind so that

347
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
people come in and sit and it has a

348
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
light in their eyes what should have to

349
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,680
light my eyes now it's a good feeling

350
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,040
it's a good feeling to have no it's not

351
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
it's like there's sort of like those

352
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,560
like mafia intimidation seers like what

353
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
do you do

354
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
where did you hide the money

355
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
what applications are you using

356
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
very very effective when you're doing

357
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,240
baa also completely by accident that's

358
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
where we sat we realized halfway in this

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
was a bad choice as everyone was

360
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
squinting at us and trying to answer the

361
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
questions but i kept saying okay

362
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,240
what happens if

363
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
the technology goes down i realize use

364
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
this asset for that sas app whereas you

365
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
use workday or servicenow or whatever

366
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
maybe what happens if that app goes down

367
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
they're like

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,079
well then we don't work like no but i

369
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,920
mean what's your like fallback

370
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
procedure right

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
in the old days you're gonna be an

372
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,440
operations team like no we just we don't

373
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
work like but what do you do and finally

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
it's one person's like they're an

375
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,120
accountant they're like the wolf you

376
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
need to understand we're not going to

377
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
haul out the big piece of metal and put

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,800
your card down and the blue

379
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,399
to run a credit card

380
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
we're a international company that's not

381
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
how we work if that enabling idea is

382
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,639
down we are down

383
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
like well that sucks that doesn't i mean

384
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
that makes their plan easier if you're

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
down you're down but that doesn't allow

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
for much flexibility unfortunately

387
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
that's where a lot of us are today

388
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,880
there's not a lot of slack in the system

389
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
so we have to know what we have we have

390
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
to know what it means

391
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
now i will say before i jump to the next

392
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,279
slide

393
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,639
how much do we need to know

394
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,519
is it 10 percent is it 150

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,800
i don't know

396
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
for a long time

397
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,560
when you talk to someone in business

398
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
continue disaster recovery

399
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
up until today when you talk to a

400
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
security professional

401
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
they'll say something like the following

402
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
we've got really good controls around

403
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,639
our crown jewels

404
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,839
and you'd be like oh yeah what about

405
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,480
everything else though

406
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,760
oh so like just your crown jewels no we

407
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
got really good controls just during the

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,839
ground trills you know you can't so

409
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,839
that's wink like don't ask me any more

410
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
questions right one of those things how

411
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
much is your crown jewels is that five

412
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,279
percent of that ten percent of the

413
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
environment

414
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
not very much but maybe that's okay if

415
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,600
we just get those systems up we're in a

416
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
good spot maybe we just recover those

417
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
systems

418
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,000
when i was at the money management firm

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
that was exactly the attack i took we

420
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
recovered our crown jewels

421
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,040
and we had this backup war room where

422
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
had monitors and everything you would

423
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
imagine like you know if you've seen

424
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
wolf of wall street it was that thing um

425
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,959
and yes my name's wolfgang there may be

426
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
a wolf a wall street joke i'll take it

427
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,680
but

428
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
that's not my point point is imagine

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
that and all my traders come in and

430
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,279
we've simulated that asteroid coming all

431
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,120
my traders come in they sit down and

432
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
they pull up to their desk and screens

433
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
start popping and charts start shining

434
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
and the market starts trending and we're

435
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,320
online and we're wired into new york and

436
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
i'm like yes

437
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
i'm feeling even better about this than

438
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
the zombie story if i'm telling you the

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
truth i'm like yes we did it

440
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
and uh and the head trader turns around

441
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,199
goes okay this is great but uh where's

442
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
all my plugins

443
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,760
i go what do you mean he goes well you

444
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,959
don't think i actually like click on

445
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,519
things to trade i need all my plugins

446
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
i'm like you never told me about plugins

447
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
there was no survey that said you had

448
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,920
plug-ins he goes well i told you i just

449
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
need everything on my desktop but i'll

450
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
we're on this desktop

451
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
so we missed those plugins those are not

452
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,120
within that ten percent

453
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,079
so we haven't known how much

454
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,600
we need to recover for a long time

455
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
scientia looked at this uh in their

456
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
study they're like how much of our

457
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
systems and scope should we recover and

458
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
they plotted it against how likely

459
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,839
organizations will report to have

460
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
successful recovery and as you can see

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
one of the things that really surprised

462
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,160
me

463
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
is the most likely to maintain business

464
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
continuity were people who are doing 80

465
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,319
percent of more of their systems

466
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
i would have figured 20

467
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
but 20

468
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,199
50

469
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,600
up to 80 almost flat 80 or more is where

470
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,199
we saw the big jump

471
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,079
that

472
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
i don't know how to wrap my head around

473
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
because how do we get 80 of those

474
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,199
applications if we don't have good

475
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,800
visibility into what those are i think

476
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,360
that starts with things like caspy that

477
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
starts with having a more of a dynamic

478
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
acid inventory as opposed to static acid

479
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,519
inventory that starts with having more

480
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
conversations with folks

481
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,600
to figure out what we're missing but

482
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
that is very concerning to me because

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
there's a bunch of blind spots that we

484
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
miss

485
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,600
i told that story about oh yeah everyone

486
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,839
came down it's like where's my plugins i

487
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
told that story to see so i was coaching

488
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
uh recently it was about a year ago he's

489
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,839
like oh

490
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,279
stop listening like halfway to that

491
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
story he's like ah don't worry about it

492
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,959
like don't worry about it he's like yeah

493
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,480
don't worry about it

494
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
okay good goes i already figured out

495
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
browser plugins i audit for those

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,679
that is good

497
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
that is good but that also misses the

498
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,240
point the point wasn't let's add one

499
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
more layer of visibility the point is

500
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
there's always going to be something we

501
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,799
don't see

502
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,240
how do we get

503
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,319
to the reality of what we don't see part

504
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,359
of that is

505
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
asking people serving people assessing

506
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
their devices having visibility but the

507
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
point is we need to be humble about what

508
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,199
we know especially we're trying to get

509
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
to 80

510
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,120
okay

511
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,479
next thing threat scenarios

512
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
threat scenarios

513
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
in that asteroid we need to be very

514
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
careful not to build specific plans for

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,919
asteroids and earthquakes and fires and

516
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,280
floods with the caveat that i am in

517
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,080
where i am hurricanes are a real thing

518
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
hurricanes we should probably have a

519
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
very specific plan for but in general

520
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
when organizations are building out

521
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
their plans they should look at these

522
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
threat scenarios and group them by

523
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
effect otherwise we end up with very big

524
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,200
plans

525
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
conflicting things

526
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,000
conflicting uh procedures and the longer

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
a plan is we know the harder it is to

528
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
maintain and therefore the more likely

529
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
it is to be out of date

530
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
we then look at the different processes

531
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,679
and we tier those okay if if payroll and

532
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
hr are down marketing down what does

533
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
that mean probably about the same impact

534
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,760
to the business if production is down if

535
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,000
i can't trade if i'm in health care and

536
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,320
i can't do patient uh health and safety

537
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,559
if i can't deliver health care that's a

538
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,160
much better

539
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
much worse much larger impact so we want

540
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
to tier those

541
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,799
up so we've got a few different things

542
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
coming out of that we need to

543
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
build a strategy but first what's

544
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,880
important is the disaster is the impact

545
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
we think about resilience

546
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
um resilience isn't

547
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
nothing bad ever happens

548
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
right resilience isn't

549
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
we can get punched in the face we can

550
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
keep going

551
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
i had a storage array way back in the

552
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
day i had a storage array

553
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
and uh and we partnered with this

554
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,880
organization because it was super fast

555
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
but for whatever reason they had bought

556
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
a bad batch of drives

557
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
and we were losing

558
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
a couple drives a day

559
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,039
and the drives would fail we had a big

560
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
stockpile of other drives we pull in

561
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
pull the bam drive plug in the the new

562
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
drive rebuild the raid array and go and

563
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
this went on for about six weeks one of

564
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
the most stressful

565
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
periods of my life every every day

566
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
losing a couple hard drives

567
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
and you know like a couple weeks in

568
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,919
you're starting to use oh it's fine we

569
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,960
lost three today i'm like okay that's

570
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
fine i'm like no you need to understand

571
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,919
the three we lost if we lose one more in

572
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,799
the next 12 hours we're gonna be down

573
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
i'm like oh i was really used to just

574
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
being two being okay but and three

575
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
doesn't seem that far from two so yeah

576
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
it shouldn't be but it hit this disc

577
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,320
this disc and this disc and now my

578
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,120
raid's at risk if i lose one more disc

579
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,240
and so you're just sitting through the

580
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,600
night going please don't fail please

581
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,640
don't fail

582
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
please don't fail but we made it through

583
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
we actually didn't have an outage we're

584
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,679
very fortunate

585
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,640
now

586
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
that's resilience right we had failures

587
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,840
we had things break again and again and

588
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
again but that was not a disaster the

589
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
disaster is not the event the disaster

590
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
is the impact so we think about dr what

591
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
we're trying to do is mitigate that

592
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
impact we think about dr we're trying to

593
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
say this is going to break that's going

594
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,559
to break the other thing's going to

595
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,240
break and that's going to be unavailable

596
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
how do we make sure that the

597
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
organization doesn't feel

598
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
that financially

599
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
so we do that with some strategies and

600
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
i'm going to cover a few in just a

601
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
minute but think about a strategy as

602
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,640
something that looks at the various

603
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,919
scenarios

604
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
and maps them to

605
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,919
the various recovery tiers so if we've

606
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
got those scenarios happening on the

607
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
assets for those recovery tiers we know

608
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
what to do

609
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
think about a strategy that way

610
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
now when things like the pandemic happen

611
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,039
um black swan events

612
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
when things like i had an email system

613
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
fail one time

614
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,000
and uh it was just the stupidest thing

615
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
one guy executed the wrong command

616
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,440
because he thought he was on task and he

617
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,919
was on prod and after that they're like

618
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
we will never lose email again we ended

619
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,559
up with the biggest email cluster in

620
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
like the midwest of north america

621
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
it was stupid it was stupid but these

622
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
black swan events happen

623
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,159
you know the executive teams they want

624
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,760
to make sure that that never happens

625
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,799
again

626
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,159
what's really important with black swan

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,760
events i believe

628
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,320
so i think good security is built on the

629
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
wings of black swan events we take that

630
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
black swan event we abstract a lesson we

631
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
build a strategy on it that would sure

632
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,919
address the black swan but also address

633
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,880
other bird-shaped problems in our

634
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,240
environment

635
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
we build strategies that take what

636
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
they're interested in

637
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
and we make it important right take that

638
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
make the interesting important to make

639
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
the important interesting that is the

640
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
trick of security we take those concerns

641
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,080
that the executive team has

642
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
and turn them into a strategy that can

643
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
address multiple different scenarios and

644
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
tiers that's really the trick to funding

645
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
this and making the whole wheels go

646
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,678
around on these programs

647
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,919
all right from a strategy situation

648
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,760
there's some myths old myths we don't

649
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,240
need backup we've got raid

650
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,080
we've got the data striped that works

651
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
great until this corrupted data and now

652
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
i've got corrupted data everywhere

653
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,120
don't need backup we've got replicated

654
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,039
data that's awesome now i can take the

655
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,720
corrupted data from one data center and

656
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,559
send it to another

657
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,120
that's great if i'm in aws ceased i've

658
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,600
got corruption aws west

659
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
sweet

660
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
we don't need backups we got image level

661
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
backups awesome

662
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
try to restore one file

663
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
off of off of a you know terabyte vm off

664
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
of snapshot

665
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
that's terrible also

666
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
bonus points if you're trying to do it

667
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
at the exact same time that everyone

668
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
else is in the cloud council trying to

669
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
recover something

670
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,320
there are some new myths i don't need

671
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
backup i've got infrastructure as a

672
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
service

673
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
i

674
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
went into multiple different

675
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,440
conversations with organizations that

676
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,280
say you know what it's it's all right

677
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
i've got infrastructure as a service um

678
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
they're handling everything like you

679
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,679
realize is a shared responsibility model

680
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,360
right i mean you've got your

681
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
responsibility no no that it's good

682
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
because everything's running and if i

683
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
need anything it's in my s3 bucket or

684
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
whatever

685
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
okay if the bucket is corrupted or

686
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
emptied or

687
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
any number of things we don't know we

688
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
don't know

689
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,559
similar with cloud instance snapshots

690
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
i've seen uh especially with these site

691
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
failovers uh where we're like okay we

692
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,159
timed it to rebuild and reload our

693
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,279
environment from snapshots it takes

694
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
15 minutes great

695
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,520
now aws goes down aws comes up

696
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
everyone's trying to bring stuff up it's

697
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
no longer 15 minutes it's now in the

698
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
terms of hours and they're trying to

699
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
explain why

700
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,600
they had an sla for 15 minutes

701
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,039
got to be aware of these myths we got to

702
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
be aware of these concerns

703
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,799
there's some new strategies that are

704
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,480
evolving of course

705
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
some good strategies like failover

706
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
connections how do i get to my

707
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
environment direct connect express route

708
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
those sort of things

709
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
um backup recovery continues to be a

710
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
good strategy

711
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
being aware of

712
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
a lot of the open source tools will have

713
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
backup and recovery in their freemium

714
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
model but won't encrypt it or will have

715
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,039
very limited backup and recovery i can

716
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,720
backup everything but i can't back up at

717
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
the item level you want to be able to

718
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
dig into the open source software you're

719
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,120
using figure out where those edges are

720
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
and make sure that you got the ability

721
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
to

722
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,520
not only back up

723
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,440
but also restore item level

724
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,919
also encrypt that data i've seen too

725
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,000
many incidents especially in talking to

726
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
red teams they're like oh yeah we just

727
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
stole all their backups got all their

728
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
data it's perfect there's no controls

729
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,279
that way

730
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
ground to cloud still exists that was

731
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
one of the first infrastructure as a

732
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
service moves that i did

733
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
uh with azure if anything failed in my

734
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
hyper-v environment spun it up in the

735
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
shore

736
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
awesome we're moving away from that now

737
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,039
of course as more and more workloads are

738
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,159
in the cloud it doesn't really make

739
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,840
sense but there's still those

740
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
possibilities region to region is really

741
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
where it's at making sure that you've

742
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,559
got

743
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,039
wss east and west and those sort of

744
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,520
things regional recovery options when

745
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
something fails

746
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
manual processing is that even a thing

747
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
maybe maybe

748
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,240
i like in manual processing

749
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,360
uh they fail over ability right so

750
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,640
if my identity provider is not available

751
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,880
my customers can't log in can they still

752
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,039
purchase things maybe they can't log in

753
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
and see their order history but they can

754
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,360
still you know buy something with their

755
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,880
credit card

756
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
those types of sort of uh

757
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,120
uh gently degraded services i think are

758
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
a good way of looking at things

759
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
uh or insurance right insurance is

760
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
always a thing cyber security insurance

761
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
is still a thing how long will be a

762
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,760
thing we'll have to see

763
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,840
with all the changes in the market and

764
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
ransomware hitting it all the time but

765
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
of course insurance is always a recovery

766
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,760
strategy

767
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,960
an important thing is to do as few of

768
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,200
these strategies as possible and do them

769
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
very well the fewer we have the better

770
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
we can make sure that everyone knows

771
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
them socializes them out practice them

772
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,559
those sort of things

773
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,360
there's also a couple of do nothing

774
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,080
strategies i really liked i was helping

775
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,480
a sas company get

776
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,360
uh certified through high tech and my my

777
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
team kept asking a little how do you

778
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
backup desks how do they back up that

779
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
and they kept saying we don't why would

780
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,679
we we don't we have an ansible script we

781
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,440
don't and so finally i was really

782
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
pushing my team like that's not an

783
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
answer you can't just say we don't we

784
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,600
have to have an answer and so i uh i sat

785
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,320
down with the the lead devops architect

786
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,240
like look you can't just tell me you

787
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
don't

788
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,720
what are you doing with this he goes

789
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
well if this is a kafka pipeline any

790
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
data and it's immutable any one of these

791
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,279
hosts we can we can spin up in a

792
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,039
heartbeat if we lose any one of them

793
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
doesn't matter if we lose all of them

794
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,799
that's probably a short-term problem

795
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,840
but i'm never going to recover from

796
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,960
backup and that was the first time i

797
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,279
heard of what sono u has called the die

798
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,799
pattern if you haven't looked at this

799
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,360
highly recommend it distributed makes

800
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
sense right multiple different nodes

801
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
immutable nothing on the node itself

802
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,039
changes this is really good for data

803
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
pipelines it's very good for micro

804
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,679
services nothing on that host changes

805
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,520
and ephemeral once we're done with it we

806
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
can wipe it out and destroy it and it

807
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,440
has no impact on the environment at all

808
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,039
do nothing right i don't have to do

809
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
anything with that environment

810
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,240
just let it sit and if i got to rebuild

811
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,399
it with an ansible script i can

812
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,559
cool cool i like that

813
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,600
i think

814
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
moving forward into the future we'll

815
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,000
probably see like a layer

816
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
of dye

817
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
pattern around most of our

818
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,120
infrastructures

819
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,159
because most of them are still going to

820
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
have data and things we need to maintain

821
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
we still have devops people are doing a

822
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
lot of

823
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
in-house configurations and getting on

824
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
the systems and wiring them up and

825
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
loading config all that sort of stuff

826
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
that we don't want them to do but

827
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,559
they're still doing

828
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
that's one approach another approach of

829
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
course is that ci cd pipeline approach

830
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
which is if i lose it

831
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
that sucks but i can run a script and i

832
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
can rebuild it

833
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
awesome approach

834
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
um are there are skilling issues if

835
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
everyone's trying to run it there also

836
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,640
is

837
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
uh an issue where

838
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,919
i ran into this uh the poor guy

839
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
he uh he was using this pattern

840
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
and he was using jenkins and they lost

841
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
some systems he's like no problem

842
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
know exactly what to do i will now run

843
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,279
my jenkins script to rebuild it on

844
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
another cloud

845
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
really quite clever multi-cloud dr

846
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,279
awesome he went to ron jenkins and roz

847
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
jenkins had the same dependency as his

848
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
infrastructure did and was down

849
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,440
he had no way

850
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
to actually run and restore

851
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,200
so

852
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,039
key thing there is when we're automating

853
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
right when we're using automation we

854
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
need to remember that automation means

855
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,559
everything include that in tier zero

856
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,000
make sure that's not in the same fault

857
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
path as your underlying infrastructure

858
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
that really covers disaster recovery

859
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,799
it's bottom up we want to make sure we

860
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,320
don't get lost in the weeds we want to

861
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,000
make sure that

862
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,840
we know what our technology is we've got

863
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
a few key proven strategies to to

864
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
recover that technology and we know what

865
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
it means to the business so we can tier

866
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
it accordingly

867
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,520
next thing i want to talk about some

868
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
mistakes that people make in business

869
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
continuity

870
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,159
um

871
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,440
when i was doing consulting my team read

872
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,440
176 different continuity plans which i

873
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,640
will now summarize the mistakes of 176

874
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
continuity recovery plans

875
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,720
also i would encourage you to never read

876
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,080
176 continuity plans every one of the

877
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
team members on that team has since left

878
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,120
that company i kind of blame myself

879
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
but

880
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
here were the top three failures we saw

881
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
again and again and again

882
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,600
wrong person this one did not surprise

883
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,039
me when i was at the money management

884
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
firm the business continuity and

885
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
disaster recovery was owned by this

886
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,840
lovely lady who was a project manager in

887
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,039
the operations team and she had no

888
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,450
visibility into

889
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,679
[Music]

890
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
the technology she had no understanding

891
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,120
the technology she had no visibility to

892
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
the compliance requirements she had no

893
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,679
understanding of those compliance

894
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,840
requirements she had no visibility into

895
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,919
the executive team she had no

896
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,399
sponsorship at that level she just was

897
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
really good at being a pm and owning

898
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
this document

899
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
not good not good

900
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
i often times see this

901
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,960
two in the i.t side i was talking to

902
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,919
uh preston who who put out the book on

903
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,320
data recovery in the cloud

904
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,559
really brilliant guy highly encourages

905
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,559
uh out through o'reilly he's like you

906
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,880
know what i find is that oftentimes

907
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
business or

908
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
backup and recovery is pushed to the

909
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
junior it guy like congratulations

910
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,519
you're fresh out of college

911
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,519
you get the backups

912
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,360
it's like a junior task right and i was

913
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,399
like you know it's funny because

914
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
oftentimes in business continuity we do

915
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
the exact same thing congratulations

916
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
you're out of college we need you update

917
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
these reports in these forms and this

918
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
plan right we push it down to very

919
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,399
junior people and then we wonder why it

920
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,240
doesn't scale and it's not appropriate

921
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
it's not accurate so top failure is

922
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
having bc and dr owned by the wrong

923
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,200
person

924
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
next one is having the wrong technology

925
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
so i i say that i am protecting my uh

926
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,600
you know databases i got you know sql in

927
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
azure i'm protecting my azure sql

928
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
because i'm using

929
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,080
a bunch of palo altos i'm like wait a

930
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,919
minute what yeah yeah our palo altos we

931
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
got load balancers

932
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
okay that's great the resiliency you

933
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
know props

934
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
but how does that protect your database

935
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
well our application will go down and

936
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,120
people can get to it okay

937
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,440
but what about your database right wrong

938
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,880
technology we need to make sure that

939
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,080
we've got the right technology

940
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
supporting those systems

941
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,439
and the last one is the wrong drills

942
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
a lovely lady i mentioned it was a

943
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,960
project manager

944
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,039
she really was great did an awesome job

945
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,320
on what she

946
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
uh was given did an awesome job every

947
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,240
time i worked with her her

948
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
drill the drill that was reported up to

949
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,559
scc for business continuity

950
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,480
before i took over the plan was the fire

951
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,159
drill

952
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,799
the fire drill yeah we do uh you know

953
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,720
twice a year fire drill

954
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
the fire drill is how you're saying that

955
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
we got business continuing disaster

956
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
recovery yeah because i do it i've got

957
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
people i've got floor captains that is

958
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,679
awesome

959
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
doesn't tell me a thing about rit but

960
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,679
cool

961
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
so wrong person wrong technology wrong

962
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,480
drills who's the right person

963
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
did not have good data on this for years

964
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,760
again a lot of gut check no one really

965
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
knew this data was from that scientist

966
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
study i mentioned earlier and they found

967
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,399
that there's a drastic increase in the

968
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,480
ability for organizations to get up and

969
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
back operational if there was board

970
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
level oversight

971
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,399
of the program and if there was c-suite

972
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,159
ownership and

973
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,279
cso

974
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,120
involvement so

975
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,880
we want to make sure the board knows

976
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,320
what we're doing to keep the technology

977
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
up

978
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,640
we want to know that the the uh c-suite

979
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
has engagement and sponsorship and

980
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
supports what we're doing

981
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
especially if we have to

982
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
take time away and do drills and

983
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
interviews and those sort of things

984
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,440
and we want to make sure that the cso

985
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,279
is ultimately the person accountable for

986
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,000
it

987
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,039
that's what the data shows

988
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
all right other ways that we saw these

989
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
plans mucked up when we did this massive

990
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
study

991
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,120
i already mentioned some shared

992
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
responsibility it's outsourced i don't

993
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,159
worry about it okay shared

994
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,600
responsibility is a thing we got to make

995
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,559
sure that it's not that abstracted

996
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,880
non-standard language again very common

997
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
if we get junior people doing this um

998
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,720
but mixing up

999
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
recovery time objective recovery point

1000
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,599
objective uh not really understanding

1001
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,079
what roi means any sort of like

1002
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,239
non-standard language i see in a plan

1003
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,918
it's sort of like a you know like a code

1004
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,119
smile if you're a developer it's that

1005
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,480
sort of thing i'm like all right this

1006
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,719
doesn't smell right i know it's probably

1007
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,800
something rotten in this plant

1008
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
uh nonstandard approach i'm not saying

1009
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,560
we need to foul nist

1010
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,079
or iso 22 uh 301 i'm not saying we need

1011
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,440
to file those they're very heavy

1012
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
frameworks meant for international

1013
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,800
companies meant for very large scale

1014
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,399
companies but

1015
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,599
but

1016
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,000
they do have good life cycles they do

1017
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,839
have good processes

1018
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,599
right it should be a similar approach

1019
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,119
that if we're just making up something

1020
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,879
that doesn't align with the standard

1021
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,760
again doesn't smell right

1022
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,719
using aha as opposed to recovery i love

1023
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,719
me some high availability but that's not

1024
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,480
going to get our data back that's not

1025
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,040
going to keep our systems running

1026
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,839
having overly broad

1027
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,720
plans my favorite was

1028
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,040
something bad happened

1029
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,680
address the bad thing bring systems back

1030
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,720
online

1031
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
that's a great plan

1032
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,079
three points

1033
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,160
right now something bad happened fix the

1034
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
bad thing bring things online okay i can

1035
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,880
work with that

1036
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
um can you give me an example they

1037
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
couldn't of course like well we'll

1038
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
figure that out on our own

1039
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,839
like i don't i don't think you've really

1040
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,920
tested those strategies then i don't

1041
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
really think that you know what you're

1042
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
going to do if you if it's that vague

1043
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
the worst is the opposite very very

1044
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,280
specific plans

1045
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
bad thing happens therefore

1046
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,000
joe executes this command and this

1047
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
virtual machine

1048
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,160
at this time and then sally does this

1049
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
command

1050
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,320
in the

1051
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,359
aws management console and then jane is

1052
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,520
going to i'm like wait a minute that's

1053
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
very very specific

1054
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
when was the last time this was

1055
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
maintained is it up to date is it

1056
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
accurate what happens if jane's not

1057
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,839
available what happens if the management

1058
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,520
council is unavailable what happens how

1059
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,359
did that virtual machine even get there

1060
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,520
do we account for it being restored

1061
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,160
right that that black swan effect i

1062
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
mentioned that if we get really focused

1063
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,079
on just addressing that black swan

1064
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
instead of looking at

1065
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,440
bird-like threats

1066
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,079
we can fall into this trap

1067
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,640
and then finally handled in isolation if

1068
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,839
we've got different asset management uh

1069
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,320
programs and categorizations if we have

1070
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,560
different risk rankings like our risk

1071
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
function has tiered our applications

1072
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,599
differently than our bcdr function or

1073
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
our bia function has a different tiering

1074
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,079
than our sock function that's sort of

1075
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,960
handled in isolation really indicates

1076
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
that we're probably not recovering 80 of

1077
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,480
the environment because there's probably

1078
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
not good tie-ins with the

1079
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
asset folks we're probably not

1080
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,520
really doing good risk ranking because

1081
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
there's not good times with that and if

1082
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
we got to get a whole bunch of teams

1083
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
together really fast to figure these

1084
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,680
things out we're going to be talking a

1085
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,800
different language we're going to be

1086
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
looking at things in a different way and

1087
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,359
that's going to slow down recovery

1088
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,119
so

1089
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,720
all that to say

1090
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,560
a few good strategies

1091
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,720
right person board level oversight

1092
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
right uh technology

1093
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,240
depending on that scenario and then

1094
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,720
having a good test right having a good

1095
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
plan for that and testing that plan and

1096
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
testing that plan again and again and

1097
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,640
again again how often do we test these

1098
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,640
plans is this biannually we do a drill

1099
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,800
is this annually is this quarterly

1100
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,560
what's the good amount

1101
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,160
i used to really like like tabletops

1102
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
every month and then one

1103
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,320
quarter we would do an exercise for a

1104
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,880
different strategy and then two of those

1105
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,280
four we would select as evidence for the

1106
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
sec that's how i did it but again this

1107
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,760
is like hey what do you do you know how

1108
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,599
do you do it okay i do it this way we

1109
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,280
really didn't have good data

1110
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,400
science should ask the question how many

1111
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,560
uh events are you doing

1112
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,839
on a monthly basis for your plans and

1113
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
provide us some insight into that

1114
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
one of the things that immediately

1115
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
jumped out of me is i figured like one

1116
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
or two would be good

1117
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
it's actually five five is the magic

1118
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,000
number five

1119
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,200
events

1120
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
per month

1121
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
makes an organization 2.5 times more

1122
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,000
likely to maintain resiliency

1123
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
that's a lot

1124
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,599
that is that is a lot i don't want to be

1125
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,119
pulling the plug

1126
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,680
you know a couple times a week that

1127
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
doesn't make sense i don't want to be

1128
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,359
doing full tabletops a couple times a

1129
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,040
week that probably doesn't make sense

1130
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
when i started appealing behind this

1131
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,800
data and talking to organizations that

1132
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
had five or ten events a week what i

1133
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
found was something differently what

1134
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
they're actually doing was they were

1135
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
aligning those events and embedding them

1136
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
in the business and aligning them in a

1137
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,280
way to push information up so if you

1138
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
think about like bloom's taxonomy right

1139
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,119
if you think about bloom's taxonomy we

1140
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,320
don't need

1141
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
everyone in the business

1142
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
to be creating and evaluating our bcdr

1143
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
plans we probably just need them to

1144
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
remember we have one

1145
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
see also my zombie problem

1146
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
we probably need a few people to

1147
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,599
remember and understand who to call

1148
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,599
when something's on fire

1149
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,359
or not working

1150
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,920
so we can start lining those up to

1151
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,200
different activities and here's some of

1152
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,880
the ways i can look for the process

1153
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
owner the business process owner right

1154
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
finance accounting

1155
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,960
um their team meetings

1156
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,079
their

1157
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,680
team meetings are perfect opportunity

1158
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,160
for us to in bed jump in

1159
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,040
once uh every couple months or once

1160
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
every couple quarters and say oh by the

1161
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
way remember we're the bcdr function

1162
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
um you know supported by the board board

1163
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,520
is interested in this we just want you

1164
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,119
to know here's what the plan is at a

1165
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,040
high level when this happens here's how

1166
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
you you'd contact us

1167
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,359
that can be something that the dr team

1168
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,359
is doing monthly but if you've got 12

1169
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,040
processes you know that's once a year

1170
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
where you're making that cycle all you

1171
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,240
want those folks to do is remember and

1172
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,880
understand that there's a plan

1173
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
for the system owners

1174
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,200
aws owner devops team

1175
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
whoever owns my erp system whoever owns

1176
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,240
my hrms system what we're doing again is

1177
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,640
looking at the team meetings or standing

1178
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
all hands where we can get engaged

1179
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
what we're doing is reviewing the plan

1180
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
making sure they're aware of it we're

1181
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,240
also engaging them

1182
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,839
probably quarterly

1183
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,760
maybe a little less often or more often

1184
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
depending on the criticality of that

1185
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
uh system we're engaging them in bcdr

1186
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,079
meetings and doing a tabletop exercise

1187
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,520
and engaging them in full exercises

1188
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
this is one of the main things i learned

1189
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,400
early on when i was at the money

1190
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
management firm we had a great way of

1191
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
recovering the technology we're like

1192
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,480
yeah the technology is up we've done it

1193
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,000
we've restored we have to restore we

1194
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,520
replicate what we have to replicate we

1195
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,200
restarted services

1196
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,839
yes i can ping it everything's good

1197
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,200
and then the whole rest of business is

1198
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
like what what does that mean

1199
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
i'm like ah

1200
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,960
yes we actually have to have operations

1201
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
come in and certify this and turn it

1202
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
over ah okay fine we'll have we need a

1203
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,839
few more steps we need a few more people

1204
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,640
involved this is where uh system owners

1205
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,880
are engaged and really thinking again

1206
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,400
back to like bloom's technology this is

1207
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,520
where we're looking at apply and analyze

1208
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,040
from the bcdr owners all right cso on

1209
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,880
down whoever the function is who's

1210
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
owning this these are the folks who are

1211
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,560
going to have specific bcr dr meetings

1212
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,160
who are going to be doing after action

1213
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
reports who are going to be planning the

1214
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,119
updates who are going to be distributing

1215
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
that information now these are the folks

1216
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
who are going to be valuing the

1217
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,920
strategies adjusting the strategies and

1218
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,680
really driving things forward

1219
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,440
leading those tabletops

1220
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
capturing information

1221
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,839
this is how i would recommend getting to

1222
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
that num magic number of five

1223
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
per month

1224
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,000
i do want to say one thing about after

1225
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,880
action

1226
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
um

1227
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,920
incredibly important after action

1228
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,599
when do you do an after action well

1229
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
after obviously well yes okay sure but

1230
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,200
how soon after is really important i

1231
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,720
don't have good data on this this is my

1232
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,040
gut your mileage may vary what i've

1233
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,160
noticed is

1234
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,880
if i've done after action right

1235
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,960
as we've recovered like the event

1236
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,359
happened we've recovered i've asked

1237
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,880
people to take notes

1238
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,040
now tell me what to fix i get highly

1239
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,079
specific highly tactical answers

1240
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,240
this command didn't run this person was

1241
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,119
unavailable this virtual machine's name

1242
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
has changed uh the system owners didn't

1243
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,880
tell us that they're using these other

1244
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
parts of the applications

1245
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
if on the other hand

1246
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,480
i wait for two days

1247
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,079
you do the bcdr um i've got approval for

1248
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
hr and this is another pro tip you

1249
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,000
should get approval for hr that when

1250
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
we've got an instant response or a

1251
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
business continuity exercise i've got

1252
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,560
free pto i can just throw out my people

1253
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
you'll burn yourself out

1254
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,400
go back to your families

1255
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,200
spend 48 hours do not look at a keyboard

1256
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,599
do not pick up your phone do not touch a

1257
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,760
piece of technology

1258
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,599
do whatever you need to do sit down and

1259
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,119
watch cartoons

1260
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,359
open your favorite bottle of bourbon sit

1261
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,280
by the beach whatever it is just do what

1262
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
you need to do and just chill

1263
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,240
hr get them to approve that get them to

1264
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,319
prove that make part of that plan so

1265
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
when it happens we can give our people a

1266
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,599
break

1267
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,480
then

1268
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,079
i bring those people back

1269
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,240
two days that's it

1270
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,000
don't look at it don't think about it

1271
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,640
open up your notes do an after action i

1272
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,359
find i find when i do that

1273
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
the after action is much more strategic

1274
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,520
you know what we miss some of the things

1275
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,119
in the command line so maybe what we

1276
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,480
should do is just write a script that

1277
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
automates that you know what there's

1278
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,400
some things that we we did not have

1279
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,640
included in assets so what i want to do

1280
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,800
is just have more of a touch point when

1281
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,119
i do that all hands meetings with the

1282
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,960
process owner i'm going to ask them you

1283
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
know some questions as to what's changed

1284
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,560
in their environment tends to be much

1285
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,079
more strategic

1286
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,319
after the event after we've gotten out

1287
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
of firefighting your mileage may vary i

1288
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,680
don't have good data on that that's just

1289
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,078
what i find

1290
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,800
in terms of progress there's a couple

1291
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
key metrics

1292
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,400
business impact coverage right of all

1293
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
those different processes in the bia how

1294
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,119
much are covered by

1295
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,800
our recovery strategies

1296
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,400
of those scenarios how many of those

1297
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,640
scenarios have been covered by recent

1298
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,800
exercises how many have we tested how

1299
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,480
many we verified how many we cut our

1300
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,599
teeth on how many have we walked through

1301
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,839
uh tactically percentage of control has

1302
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,280
been covered and then we get to things

1303
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,359
like rto and rpo now you may wonder hey

1304
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,720
wolf why don't you talk about rto and

1305
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,319
rpo first

1306
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,760
rto and rp is what we talk about

1307
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,560
recovery time recovery point um sla is

1308
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,160
what we cover about how many nines are

1309
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,680
we measuring to

1310
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,359
um which incidentally was what drove

1311
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,960
that 176

1312
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,560
plans we want to make sure that everyone

1313
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,160
for this organization

1314
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,960
was meeting the slas and the metrics

1315
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,640
of the organization really fun project

1316
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,319
for me anyways

1317
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,240
maybe not for the people doing it

1318
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,520
but

1319
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,280
um i don't believe we can mate those

1320
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,720
things

1321
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,359
i don't believe we can meet those slas

1322
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,920
we don't first have bia scenario

1323
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,079
coverage and tactical coverage i go

1324
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,760
right back to that data graph i showed

1325
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,359
in the beginning which is 80 percent of

1326
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,280
the systems covered

1327
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440
provided the highest level of assurance

1328
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,040
i think we need to start first with

1329
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,680
coverage and then make sure that we're

1330
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,799
able to hit those numbers

1331
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,040
and then once we have that we can start

1332
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
embracing chaos so if you've been

1333
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
following along with uh chaos

1334
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,400
engineering um it's been picking up

1335
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,160
steam again there's a great book from

1336
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,119
o'reilly about ks engineering this comes

1337
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,640
from the fine folks at netflix uh back

1338
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
when netflix had some great content on

1339
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
it um sorry if there's anyone from

1340
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,599
netflix in the audience uh but

1341
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,359
netflix was like hey i'm gonna issue a

1342
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,520
ks monkey it's gonna wander around and

1343
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,119
the script is gonna unplug things and

1344
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,440
restart services and and have bad things

1345
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,240
happen why because if there's an outage

1346
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,400
if there's a bad bug we're already

1347
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
familiar as a devops team as a function

1348
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,560
on how to respond and recover to that

1349
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,160
we're starting to see that same

1350
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,240
methodology and same thinking come over

1351
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,520
to security

1352
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,599
how can we use chaos engineering to

1353
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,400
inject some problems into the

1354
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,480
environment and then make sure we can

1355
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,240
recover

1356
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
when sanchez looked at this they found

1357
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,040
that

1358
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
there was a big jump and people were

1359
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,720
saying that chaos theory was part of

1360
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,800
their standard process

1361
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,280
i put this last because

1362
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
those same folks were already reporting

1363
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,520
that had a very mature

1364
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
bcdr program

1365
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,000
i'm very concerned

1366
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,640
about we pushed this down to the junior

1367
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,880
rit guy we pushed this down to the

1368
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
junior security guy

1369
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,160
and the junior rit guy and security

1370
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,599
guard are like you know what's cool is

1371
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,319
chaos and then they adopt chaos

1372
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,800
engineering and bypass everything else

1373
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,480
we've talked about and now we've got

1374
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
things going up and down because they

1375
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,040
saw a number that that gra you know was

1376
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,359
made organizations twice as likely to be

1377
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,440
highly resilient

1378
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,040
that is going to happen you know it's

1379
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,240
going to happen you know it's going to

1380
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
happen in some org so i want to put this

1381
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,680
out there that that is the direction

1382
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,839
that people are going in and it's a

1383
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,680
really powerful direction but we've got

1384
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,760
to get the fundamentals first we've got

1385
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,880
to have strong bars a good pile of

1386
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,880
bananas before we turn the monkey loose

1387
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
okay so that's business continuity top

1388
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,240
down

1389
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,559
don't forget to connect the dots

1390
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,800
let's talk a little bit about using this

1391
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,079
program strategically

1392
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,440
for years and years and years business

1393
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,680
economy disaster recovery i've liked it

1394
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
it's fun we have a drill we have a clock

1395
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,920
we put that clock up there we count down

1396
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
to the sla people are running it's

1397
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
exciting um

1398
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
it's fun

1399
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,119
but a lot of people didn't really think

1400
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,880
about it oftentimes ignoring low

1401
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
capability until we did the study with

1402
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,640
scientia and asked what actually works

1403
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,720
with security i honestly had started

1404
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
really forgetting about bcdr i was very

1405
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,640
surprised when they came and said look

1406
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,280
when we look at this there are some five

1407
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,960
practices that are tied with everything

1408
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,520
we want to do from enabling the business

1409
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,119
to managing the risk there are five

1410
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,880
practices that we found

1411
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,359
that correlate with driving behavior and

1412
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,079
one of them was continuity

1413
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,160
now when they mapped it out they came up

1414
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,680
with this great chart you can explore

1415
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,599
this data it's a bit of an eye chart

1416
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,440
what it is is the higher the number the

1417
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,280
more likely they were to do these

1418
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,960
various activities

1419
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
i went and crunched this out and peeled

1420
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,480
off

1421
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
just resilience right these are the five

1422
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,920
practices that are most related to drive

1423
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,280
security outcomes

1424
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,720
two of them being resilience instant

1425
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,559
response and disaster recovery i peeled

1426
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,640
those two out and i looked at

1427
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,960
what organizations were able to do

1428
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,359
better if they reported that they were

1429
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,800
more resilient

1430
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
first thing they're more likely to gain

1431
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,400
the confidence of the executive

1432
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,720
leadership they're more likely to have

1433
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,400
peer support

1434
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,920
that makes a little bit sense right if

1435
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
you're talking

1436
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
like so many technologists do

1437
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,599
about this instance or that instance or

1438
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,960
this service or that surface of the

1439
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,640
kafka pipeline

1440
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,960
uh

1441
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,119
executive leadership is like glazed over

1442
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,400
okay it sounds like you get that under

1443
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
control i'll see you later and they're

1444
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,599
already out the door

1445
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,960
if we're instead talking about

1446
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,359
technology in terms of what its meaning

1447
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,280
is to the business

1448
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,200
every single time that i was in

1449
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
healthcare i tied it back to protecting

1450
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,920
the patients

1451
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,680
every single time i was in money

1452
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,839
management firm i tied it back to funds

1453
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,079
and reputation i've got a good friend in

1454
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,640
trucking and as a cso every time he

1455
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,079
talks about security talks about the

1456
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,040
trucks

1457
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,200
the way we get there is by tying that

1458
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
enabling technology up through data

1459
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,520
flows up to business processes i think

1460
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,559
that's what's driving that

1461
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,480
organizations with resiliency are more

1462
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,839
likely to keep up with the business and

1463
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,760
manage top risk same thing we've already

1464
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,599
thought about some of the impacts and

1465
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,400
whether it's a new version of ransomware

1466
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,040
or it's a worm or it's

1467
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,559
um something funky in dns if it takes

1468
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,119
the systems down and we've got to manage

1469
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,040
that downtime it's going to have a

1470
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
comparable issue so i think that's why

1471
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,760
we're better able to manage risks

1472
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,839
unplanned work and wasted effort is

1473
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,359
pretty much exactly what we're trying to

1474
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,520
do same thing with losses

1475
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,359
more likely to be running cost

1476
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,400
effectively this one is intriguing to me

1477
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,040
i was working with a the the north

1478
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,240
america's headquarters of an

1479
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,760
international company

1480
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,000
they're doing a by bia

1481
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,319
and in doing that they found a large

1482
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,640
number of redundant applications

1483
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,880
significant number i think the the

1484
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,559
amount of money they're able to save by

1485
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,119
consolidation was in the millions

1486
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,400
so obviously that money went to the

1487
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
security department right that's the way

1488
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,680
it should work no

1489
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,359
did not i think they got like a gold

1490
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,119
star on the review but you know how it

1491
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,800
goes

1492
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,960
but you're more likely to be able to run

1493
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,400
cost effectively if you know where those

1494
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,920
redundancies are and you can work with a

1495
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,160
team to maintain mansion

1496
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,920
so first get continuity and recovery

1497
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
right and then use the program

1498
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
strategically then use the program to

1499
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,960
achieve

1500
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
these types of outcomes we know

1501
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,839
statistically from a data perspective

1502
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,680
that these are the outcomes that are

1503
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,160
possible and are very likely so get the

1504
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,680
program running and then make that

1505
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,000
happen

1506
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,280
all right final thoughts

1507
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
continuing in recovery recovery we do

1508
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,319
bottom up don't get lost lost in the

1509
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,520
weeds

1510
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,440
continuity go top down make sure we're

1511
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,359
tying those threads and that things are

1512
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,440
coming together common mistakes get the

1513
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,160
right person with the right strategies

1514
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
and do the right drills

1515
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,000
and then strategically i just mentioned

1516
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,839
all the different things that programs

1517
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,240
can do

1518
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,240
so

1519
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,520
elevators

1520
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,040
um

1521
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,640
when you leave here you go up to your

1522
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,880
room or go back to where you come from

1523
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,079
the next time you're an hour check out

1524
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
where the elevator is what elevator

1525
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,839
manufacturer it is

1526
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,520
and might be otis

1527
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,960
i've got a bad habit of doing this i

1528
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
took my wife from mother's day to the

1529
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,319
san diego zoo

1530
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,160
and had a private tour and the tour

1531
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,440
guide was telling me all about the

1532
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,040
elevators and she was walking behind me

1533
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,880
just shaking her head

1534
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,960
i feel really bad for her but i did find

1535
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,400
some there's some really good stuff in

1536
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,000
the elevators in the zoo in case you

1537
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,119
want to know

1538
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,000
why otis otis is interesting because 100

1539
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,440
years ago maybe 150 years ago otis

1540
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
elijah otis the namesake was creating

1541
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,920
elevators he'd go up on a platform four

1542
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,079
to six stories high they would cut the

1543
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,680
rope he would fall

1544
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,559
the

1545
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,400
elevator would miraculously stop the

1546
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,240
crowd would cheer

1547
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,839
again before netflix there was a lot of

1548
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,839
entertainment this is what they had

1549
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,319
everyone loved it and what he had

1550
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,800
invented was not the elevator

1551
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,400
otis did not invent the oliver he

1552
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,240
invented the elevator break

1553
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,400
he invented the resiliency that gave

1554
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,720
people the confidence to use the

1555
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,559
elevator and that enabled the last major

1556
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,480
migration when people moved from country

1557
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,640
to city and people moved from the ground

1558
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,480
floor to the top floor because they

1559
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,640
could trust those elevators the last

1560
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,359
major migration about 100 years ago of

1561
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,280
course we're in the middle of a new

1562
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,680
migration as not one from that's

1563
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,839
physical but one that's digital one

1564
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,839
where we transact most of our work

1565
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,160
online we transact most of our shopping

1566
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,960
online our food online everything online

1567
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,280
they asked people in the valley recently

1568
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,400
hey where are you going to build your

1569
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
next startup and

1570
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,559
before the pandemic goes san francisco

1571
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,160
after the pandemic

1572
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,680
online

1573
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,280
we're in the middle of the next big

1574
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,800
migration

1575
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,640
what that means is

1576
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,280
resiliency the resiliency we build today

1577
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,440
the elevator breaks

1578
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
that we developed today all of us in

1579
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,280
security

1580
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,200
all of us looking at cyber security and

1581
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,400
infosec

1582
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,240
that resiliency is effectively what's

1583
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,599
going to make tomorrow's wonders

1584
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,079
possible

1585
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,160
with that thank you very much i believe

1586
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,599
i'm at time

1587
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,200
i don't know are we taking questions or

1588
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,319
not i can't see anything

1589
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,640
sure

1590
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,160
no it's it's trademarked you have to pay

1591
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,240
me two bitcoin

1592
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,240
yeah of course of course absolutely

1593
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,440
100.

1594
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,880
all right well i hope you guys have a

1595
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,280
great time oh i really can't see so you

1596
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,680
gotta yell out by cdu yes sir

1597
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,680
um

1598
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,839
yeah cloud and on-prem so

1599
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,160
um i've seen ground to cloud where if

1600
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,680
the on-premise is impacted there is a

1601
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,240
process to restore key services in cloud

1602
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,760
containers

1603
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,680
so that is one strategy

1604
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,079
the traditional hot site or multiple

1605
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,240
different sites still works for on-prem

1606
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,760
so if we can move that over and we still

1607
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,000
have like direct pairing with the cloud

1608
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,359
that will work

1609
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,520
so really what effectively becomes is

1610
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,079
the traditional strategies for

1611
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,799
on-prem ensuring that they also move

1612
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,799
with the cloud where we get into trouble

1613
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,200
is is the cloud down we could probably

1614
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,880
handle that it's on prem down we

1615
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,720
probably handle that is the cloud and

1616
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,799
on-prem prem down that's where we end up

1617
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,880
in scenarios where i've had to move from

1618
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,400
east to west and now i don't have direct

1619
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,359
peering back to my dr data center so if

1620
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,799
you grid that out and look at the

1621
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,240
different fault paths

1622
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
um you can follow that path and make

1623
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,839
sure you got the right recovery in

1624
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,920
all right with that i will get off stage

1625
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,670
thank you so much

1626
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:04,079
[Applause]

1627
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,399
thank you
