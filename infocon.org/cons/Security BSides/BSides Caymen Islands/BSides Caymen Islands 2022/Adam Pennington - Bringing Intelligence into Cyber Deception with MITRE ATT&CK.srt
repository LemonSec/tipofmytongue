1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,840
good morning

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,440
looks like we have the early birds here

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,520
today that's great

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
thank you for joining us

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
so we're going to start off today with

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,080
um

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
for those of you already

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,000
been at the 8 30 sessions this morning

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,439
that's great

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,400
uh but today i'm going to welcome to the

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
stage adam pennington

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,199
who is the attack lead at mitre

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
so adam leads attack at the mitre

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
corporation and collected much of the

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
intelligence leveraged in creating

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,719
attacks initial techniques

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
he has spent much of those 13 years with

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
mitre studying and preaching the use of

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,840
deception

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
for intelligence gathering

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
prior to join mitra

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
mitre adam was a research at carnegie

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
mellon's parallel data lab and earned

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
his bs and ms degrees in computer

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,559
science and electrical and computer

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,159
engineering as well as the 2017

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
alumni service award from carnegie

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,479
mellon university

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,200
adam has presented and is published in a

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
number of venues including first cti

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
eusynix security defcon and acm

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
transactions on information and system

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,400
security so please welcome adam to the

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
stage with bringing intelligence into

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,320
cyber deception with mitre attack

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
thank you

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,840
and good morning cayman

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
so as

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,960
jane just said in my lovely introduction

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
my name is adam pennington i'm going to

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
be talking about something a little bit

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
different this morning i'm going to be

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
talking about cyber deception

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
and i'm going to be talking about using

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
a framework called mitre attack to do a

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
lot of the planning around it

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,119
if you haven't heard of mitre we're a

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,200
united states not-for-profit working in

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
the public interest been around about 60

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
years

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
and everything i'm going to be talking

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
about today is free and open source

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
so some of this was just in my

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
introduction so i'm not going to belabor

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:16,959
it

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,680
i run the miter attack framework that

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
i'll be getting into in a little bit

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
i've been with mitre for quite a while

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
at this point with a focus on threat

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
intelligence and deception so today this

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
talk is bringing two of my favorite

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
topics together

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,959
i've been in the trenches in the past i

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
wasn't always managing a

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
you know sort of database of adversary

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,800
activities i've been in security

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
operations centers as well as a threat

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
intelligence analysis and i've been

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
involved with the attack framework

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
itself since it was first created as an

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,760
excel spreadsheet

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
so my excitement in seeing b-sides

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
cayman islands come to pass

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,760
is that i'm also a scuba diver i've been

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
coming down to cayman for 16 years to

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
dive i have over 400 hours of bottom

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
time in the cayman islands

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
so i the journey that i'm planning to

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
take through the rest of this talk

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,680
i'm going to talk about classical

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
deception so what we've known how to do

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,280
now for thousands of years in warfare

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
and intelligence planning

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
how we can bring that into cyber

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
security

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
i'm going to show how we can use attack

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
to start building up the intelligence we

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,480
need

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
to be able to do some of this planning

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
work through a methodology

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
for doing deception planning in cyber

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
security and then leave you with some

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,159
takeaways

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
so just to get us all on the same page i

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
want to start with the dictionary

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
definition of deception

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
deception is the act of causing somebody

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,080
to accept as true or valid what is false

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,519
or invalid

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,319
in short it's lying to somebody with the

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,120
intent on them believing it

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
and so we're going to try to use lying

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
for good in for the purposes of cyber

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
security

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
deception is not a new concept

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
and i promise despite on the slide i

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,478
have no sun tzu quotes in my talk

108
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
but uh

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,880
deception's been a in warfare for a very

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
long time written about by sun tzu

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
thousands of years ago

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
it truly came into its own during world

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
war ii

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
with things like the british double

115
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
cross system uh events like the man who

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
never was where the brits floated a dead

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
body ashore off of spain

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
uh or people watch

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
netflix operation mints meet

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
during the cold war a lot of practices

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
around deception became codified and we

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
learned how to do this a bit better

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
and so people like barton whaley

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
talked about different mechanisms for

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
doing it

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
it's not that new in cyber security

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
either

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,039
so in 1989 a book was published called

129
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
the cuckoo's egg where cliff stole

130
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,680
talked about the actions of a russian

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
hacker as they work their way through

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
different computers mostly united states

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
and one of the things that he did during

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
the courses was to put the hacker in a

135
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
fake environment to see what they did

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
incidentally mitre has a role in the

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
story we are one of the companies hacked

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,479
the honey knit project started in 1999

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
and they've done a lot of terrific work

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,720
putting out open source tools putting

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
out instructions and tales on things

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
that can be done with honey potting and

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
in the deception space

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
and it's become a product space too so

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
people are starting to make

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
money on this as well i'm not going to

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
be talking about any products today

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
but

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
you know it's become an area such that

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
even gartner is you know looking

151
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,639
comparing and stacking different

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
deception solutions

153
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
so you know we don't usually talk about

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
deception i think i'm the first person

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
to mention the word

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,000
at b-sides at least

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
so why use it in cyber security well it

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
lets us do some things that we can't do

159
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
with normal defensive mechanisms

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
so for one we can increase ambiguity for

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
an adversary we can cause somebody who

162
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
has successfully broken into an

163
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
environment has access to the crown

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
jewels you know all the data

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
to ask themselves is this information

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
real

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
to doubt that the material that they've

168
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
stolen is even what they wanted

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
then you can get them to ask things like

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
am i on the right network and am i where

171
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
i intended to actually hack today

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
now my focus and where a lot of my

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
planning is going to be talking about

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
today is on gathering data on an

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,479
adversary

176
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
so trying to put an adversary in a fake

177
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
environment to ask yourself how does an

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,599
adversary look when they think that

179
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
they've hacked us

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
and finally it can even be used for

181
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
things like discrediting the adversary

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,319
so in 2016 the russians hacked the usdnc

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,800
political campaigns and leaked a lot of

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
information

185
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,479
related to the 2016 campaign

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
the french saw this and in 2017 the

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
macron campaign

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,199
inserted a bunch of fake emails into

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
their own email spools

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
and so when russians then hacked and

191
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,639
leaked

192
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
a bunch of the emails from the campaign

193
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
the campaign was able to point out

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
see a lot of this is fake it's it's sort

195
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
of obviously fake

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
you know why can you trust any of this

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,280
and it worked

198
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
and so to this day you don't really know

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
which of those materials were true and

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
which were plants

201
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
at some biters doing other work in

202
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
deception space i wanted to give a shout

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
out to some of my colleagues with

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
another free

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
tool that's out there

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
that was released in final couple months

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
ago called miter engage

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
so this gets into a broader set of

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
options than i'm going to be really

210
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
covering today but just wanted to show

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
some of the scope of work in this space

212
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
the way engage is organized

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
is that it starts with

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
what you're trying to do to the

215
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
adversary are you trying to find out

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
they're on a network expose them are you

217
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,479
trying to change how they operate and

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
affect them are you trying to gather

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,319
intelligence about them or elicit

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
information

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
it gets into the broad deception

222
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
categories that you're going to use to

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
actually do that

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
and then specific techniques that you

225
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
can put against the adversary

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
and again they put out a bunch of free

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,159
resources at their website a number of

228
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
them actually work hand in hand with

229
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
some of the processes i'm going to be

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
working on today

231
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
and these came out just a couple months

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
ago

233
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,360
that's that's some of the tooling that's

234
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
out there some of the things to gather

235
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
information on options and deception

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
but what are some of the terms you might

237
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
have already heard in this space

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,959
so

239
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
most of the work today is not focused on

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
you know disinformation trying to

241
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
discredit the adversary

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
most today is focused on either trying

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
to expose the adversary which i often

244
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
call deception for detection so trying

245
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,399
to find an adversary is actually on your

246
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,279
network as they trip over something

247
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,480
and so this could be something like

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
honey pots many of you probably familiar

249
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
with the term already

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,800
honey tokens so placing fake information

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
around your network and hoping that it

252
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
gets touched

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
i also have a long history you know back

254
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
to the cuckoo's egg of deception for

255
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
intelligence gathering what engage calls

256
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
elicitation

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
and so these are things like honey pots

258
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
honey nuts we're building up bigger

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
systems

260
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
a lot of people don't like the term

261
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
honeypot so we've started to see

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
deception environments but it's really

263
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
all the same thing

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
it's a lot of options here lots of tools

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
which of these is is appropriate for you

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
i'm an intelligence person and a common

267
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,120
answer for any intelligence analyst is

268
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,839
it depends

269
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
some types of engagements some of these

270
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,279
types of systems

271
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
require a lot more adversary

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
understanding than others you might need

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,680
to know

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
you know who it is that's coming after

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
you what they've seen in the past how

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
they tend to operate

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
and it's important not to put some of

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
these options

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
in the way of doing basic hygiene

280
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
you know if you don't already have

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
things like multi-factor authentication

282
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,160
patching

283
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
maybe it's not time yet to start diving

284
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
down deception

285
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
so these are also much more accessible

286
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
and lower risk than others

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
scattering fake data around your network

288
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
and watching to see if it gets touched

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,760
is not very risky

290
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
there's some risk that somebody

291
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
accidentally stumbles over it thinks

292
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
that they've you know found some

293
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,959
information they shouldn't have you

294
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
might have false positives

295
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
but there isn't much risk in it in

296
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
getting out

297
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
doing a full-blown honey pot and putting

298
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
an adversary in it intentionally trying

299
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
to get them to operate for weeks or

300
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
months at a time

301
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
can have some risk if you haven't taken

302
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,200
proper precautions

303
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,959
everything from

304
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
government agencies thinking that you've

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
been hacked

306
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
to the press finding out and announcing

307
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
that you've had a

308
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,399
recent breach

309
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
but if done correctly the reward can be

310
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
high

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
you can gather tons of intelligence

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,760
about what adversaries are doing in the

313
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
wild

314
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
so we've been doing this for a while but

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
we actually still see some fairly common

316
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,040
problems in how both products and open

317
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,639
source tooling are being used in

318
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
deception

319
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
primary two that i see are first

320
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
mismatched visibility

321
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
the capabilities are not where the

322
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
adversaries are looking

323
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
so if i have an adversary

324
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
that it only targets

325
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,360
active directory to find other systems

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
the way they get in

327
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,680
is they dump the entire ldap out of

328
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
active directory look for systems in

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
there and i've just bought a product

330
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
that the only way an adversary can find

331
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
it is by port scanning

332
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
well the adversary is not deceived

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
because they can't even find it

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
and this this actually happens fairly

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
commonly

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
the other area we see is mismatched

337
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
expectations

338
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
so the capabilities don't look like what

339
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,760
an adversary expects to find in that

340
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
type of environment

341
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,800
so say our capability just has

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
a single local account because we're

343
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
spinning up a virtual machine or a

344
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
system right before we're running an

345
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
adversary in it and the password was

346
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,560
changed five minutes ago as we built out

347
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
the virtual machine

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
well if we have an adversary that looks

349
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
for a lot of well-established accounts

350
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
they expect accounts to have been around

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
for weeks or months

352
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
then we might be in trouble trying to

353
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
actually convince them of anything

354
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
so we know how to do deception we've

355
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
been doing it you know since the

356
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
bc era

357
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
we've been doing it in the cyberspace

358
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,639
for this many years

359
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
and so what's still going wrong

360
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,200
a lot of it comes down to mirror imaging

361
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
mirror imaging is a cognitive bias that

362
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
is common in intelligence analysis

363
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,839
that mirror imaging is the idea that we

364
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
are naturally wired to assume that our

365
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,800
adversary thinks like we do

366
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
and so in some spaces the process of

367
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
saying well if i was an adversary what i

368
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
would do is

369
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
actually can be really helpful for sort

370
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
of expanding the options

371
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
uh getting into it

372
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
but it can be dangerous in intelligence

373
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
analysis

374
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
so quoting from richard's here

375
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
mirror imaging leads to dangerous

376
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
assumptions because people in other

377
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
cultures do not think the way we do

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
and in cyber security it gets beyond

379
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
that too

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
our adversaries may have different

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
constraints than us they may have rules

382
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
that are given to them by supervisors

383
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,120
that a red team or a pen tester doesn't

384
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,959
have they may have tools that are easily

385
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,480
accessible to them

386
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
they may or may not have things that are

387
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,560
easy for them to do

388
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
and so we need to be careful about how

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
we make our assumptions

390
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
and this is something we've known how to

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
do again for quite a while

392
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,639
we've done formal deception planning

393
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
in other intelligence areas

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,399
for decades

395
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
in order to get around things like our

396
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
mirror imaging bias

397
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
and so up front before we do deception

398
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,800
in the normal non-cyberspace

399
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
we always research the adversary we want

400
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
to understand to the best of our ability

401
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
our adversary's preconceptions

402
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
expectations and reactions

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
what do they think they're going to find

404
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
when they break into a network

405
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
what is it they're going to do if they

406
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
find specific things and all that comes

407
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,199
before we start getting into designing a

408
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,240
deception so there's this tendency to

409
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
want to put the technology first and

410
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
then figure out what to do with it but

411
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,320
that can be really dangerous in the

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,279
space

413
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
where you need to actually match

414
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
your adversary rather than the other way

415
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
around

416
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
so you know you get into designing your

417
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,720
deception

418
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
where you're building out a cover story

419
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
you know what it is that you're supposed

420
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199
to look like to an adversary

421
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,560
determine what it is you need to hide

422
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,320
from them to be successful what it is

423
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,759
you need to actually create and show

424
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
them

425
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
develop your full plan so figure out

426
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
what you need to do in terms of denial

427
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
and deception i'll be getting into each

428
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
of these steps

429
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,519
deploy it and then finally monitoring

430
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
control get it out there

431
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,279
so that first step

432
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
is understanding the adversary building

433
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
up a profile

434
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
of what it is our adversary expects how

435
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
they're going to react

436
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
and so traditional deception planning is

437
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
a very intelligence driven process

438
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
so we can apply a similar process to

439
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,399
cyber deception but as defenders

440
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
we're likely not going to know

441
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,920
preconceptions and expectations directly

442
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
we don't get to walk up to the

443
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,079
ransomware group that's trying to break

444
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
into us and say hey

445
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
when you hack me next week what do you

446
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
think you're going to find five minutes

447
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,639
into the operation

448
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,040
it'd be super nice but it's just not how

449
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
the world works

450
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
and so we can infer infer a lot of this

451
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
based on how they behave and how they

452
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
behaved in other systems

453
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
so we need to build up this intelligence

454
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,360
picture

455
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
and so that's what i'm going to be using

456
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
attack for today

457
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
and incidentally taking off of west bay

458
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
in 2019 teaching a a crab underwater

459
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,839
about attack

460
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
so i'm going to get into a couple

461
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
minutes just

462
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,919
running down a attack 101 if you haven't

463
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
used it before before i start using it

464
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
in my talk

465
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
what is attack at its core it's a

466
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
knowledge base of adversary behaviors

467
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
it's like an encyclopedia

468
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
of things that adversaries have done in

469
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,520
the real world

470
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
so it's focused on these real world

471
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,880
observations things that have been done

472
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,679
in

473
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,320
real intrusions rather than

474
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,919
things that have just been seen from pen

475
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,080
testers or red teams

476
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
and we think there's some value in the

477
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,840
focus that brings into specific

478
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
behaviors

479
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
it's free open and globally accessible

480
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
you can use it you can fork it you can

481
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
put it in commercial products

482
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
it's all okay by us

483
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,799
it's a common language so a lot of

484
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,559
governments and companies these days are

485
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,160
putting out the reporting leveraging

486
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
attack it's everything run from the us

487
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,440
government

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
uk government new zealand australia

489
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
the russian fsb uses attack in some of

490
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
their reporting

491
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,840
so it's become a common language over

492
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,919
time it's community driven most the

493
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
material we add to attack comes from

494
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
people sending us

495
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
emails saying hey

496
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
you missed this thing over here

497
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
and we add it and it becomes part of the

498
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
knowledge base for everyone else to use

499
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
if you've seen attack before this is

500
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
sort of the view

501
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
that most people are used to

502
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
it's what we call

503
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
the matrix

504
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,120
so it's it's

505
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
going to be a little bit too small so

506
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
i'm just showing the shape here really

507
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
across the top we have what we call

508
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
tactics

509
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
these are the adversaries technical

510
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
goals at a high level so things like

511
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
initial access adversaries trying to get

512
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,640
into my network

513
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,039
or exfiltration the adversary sending

514
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,400
data out of my network

515
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
underneath each of these we have the

516
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
cells that we call techniques the

517
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,559
techniques are how the goals are

518
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
achieved so instead of something broad

519
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
like initial axis we might have a

520
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
technique like fishing

521
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
this view hides another layer of

522
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
techniques

523
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,559
called sub techniques

524
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
so underneath a lot of these we have

525
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
things like instead of fishing we have

526
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
spear phishing attachment so an

527
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,280
adversary sent a malicious email with a

528
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,559
malicious attachment attached to it

529
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,480
and finally inside each of these

530
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,600
techniques

531
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
we have procedures so if you're used to

532
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
tactics techniques and procedures

533
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
it matches

534
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,480
and so procedures are specific ways that

535
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,840
adversaries have accomplished a

536
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
technique so instead of spearfishing

537
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
attachment we have apt 12 that sent

538
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
emails of malicious office documents

539
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
with pdfs attached

540
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
beyond each technique and each

541
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
sub-technique there's an english

542
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,200
language description getting into from

543
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
an adversary point of view how the

544
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
technique is actually accomplished

545
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
technical details about it some of the

546
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
varieties have it been seen in the past

547
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
there's metadata

548
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
this technique id is what a lot of

549
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
people use when i refer to that common

550
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
language that that t-156601

551
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
as well as other information for

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
centering the technique and it also

553
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
includes a bunch of defensive

554
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,120
information

555
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
on how to detect or mitigate the

556
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
technique which is not the material i'm

557
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
using today

558
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
some pieces i am using today though are

559
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,919
attack tracks a number of threat groups

560
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
in public

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
and so over 100 different threat groups

562
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,000
we've tracked open source published

563
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
intelligence about them

564
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
and information about the behaviors

565
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
they've done so again we have a

566
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
description of the group various

567
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
metadata about them

568
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
something i know a lot of people use

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,559
attack for

570
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,600
which is associated group descriptions

571
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
so different companies have different

572
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
visibility over overlapping activity and

573
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,559
naturally use different names to

574
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
describe it so one person's oil rig is

575
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
another person's cobalt gypsy there's

576
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
another person's helix kitten is

577
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,159
mandiance apt-24

578
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
and all of the these have citations back

579
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,400
to where the linkage is

580
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
for that group name

581
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
keep track of the techniques used by

582
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
each of these

583
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
and the software that each of these

584
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,159
groups is using and some of the same

585
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,919
reporting and the techniques that those

586
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
pieces of software using

587
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
and finally we back it all up with

588
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
references we show our work we have over

589
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,039
3000 references in attack

590
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
so that if you don't you don't trust us

591
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
you can go in actually see the same

592
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
reports and see if you agree with how we

593
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,158
brought them in

594
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,879
i think i just jumped like three ahead

595
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,720
really does not like that slide can you

596
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,039
advance it

597
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
thank you

598
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
um

599
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,080
yeah it's probably because the slide's

600
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
too large

601
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
but

602
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
so i'm going to be covering deception

603
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,880
the rest of this talk

604
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,640
this is not the way that attack is

605
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
normally used the way we see most people

606
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,720
use it is for organizing their

607
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
detections what sorts of behaviors

608
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,039
they're able to see on their own systems

609
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,400
we commonly see it used in threat

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
intelligence looking at different

611
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
adversaries what sorts of activities

612
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,440
they're going to be doing that i am

613
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
going to be using today

614
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
people do a lot of work with assessment

615
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,880
and engineering figuring out their

616
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
overall scope what they can see

617
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
and the reason we created attack in the

618
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,039
first place was actually for adversary

619
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,080
emulation building up for a red team a

620
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
profile of what an adversary looks like

621
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
so that the red team can operate in a

622
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,520
similar fashion

623
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
okay we've got our pieces we've got

624
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
classic deception

625
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,720
we've got attack that i'm going to use

626
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
for building up the intelligence

627
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,120
let's get into actually doing some cyber

628
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,158
deception planning

629
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,600
so i have a intelligence driven cyber

630
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
deception planning process

631
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,799
that is based closely on the classic

632
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,400
deception process i showed you earlier

633
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,520
so this starts out with a step zero that

634
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,679
we don't have in classic deception

635
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
planning which is determining who your

636
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
priority adversaries are

637
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,039
so

638
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
this is a space where cyber's a bit

639
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
different

640
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,120
in classical deception planning we tend

641
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
to know who it is we want to deceive

642
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
right off the bat

643
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
so if we're at war with somebody

644
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,880
it's whoever we're at war with

645
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
you know we might know what what

646
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
specific foreign countries

647
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
we often don't know

648
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
who's hacking us or we might have a lot

649
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,919
of people

650
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,600
hacking us that we need to think about

651
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
at the same time

652
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,559
so it's a little bit of added work that

653
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,760
we have in the cyberspace

654
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,039
we're going to build an adversary

655
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,039
profile based on cyber threat

656
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,400
intelligence what do we know about an

657
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
adversary what do we know about how they

658
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
operate

659
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,520
we're going to develop a cover story

660
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
we're going to determine what

661
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
information needs to be hidden from the

662
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
adversary and what false information

663
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,760
needs to be revealed to them to match

664
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
this cover story

665
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,640
we're going to design and build the

666
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,480
technical capability

667
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,120
deploy it gather intelligence and then

668
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,039
back to step zero to start all over

669
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,039
again

670
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,159
so step zero determine who your priority

671
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,679
adversaries are

672
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
this is actually something important way

673
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
beyond just doing

674
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,080
something like deception planning

675
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,679
if you're looking at intelligence about

676
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,600
your adversaries you need to decide

677
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
where to start or you're just going to

678
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
have paralysis

679
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
there are a lot of ways to do this

680
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
though

681
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,600
some ideas that you might take away from

682
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,840
maybe you want to focus on a adversary

683
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,000
who targets you regularly you know maybe

684
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
there's somebody who spearfishes you on

685
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,840
the first tuesday of every month

686
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,039
and you'd really like to know why

687
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,799
maybe it's an adversary who's targeted

688
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,400
other people like you

689
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,679
so

690
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,919
i see fosters here maybe you've got an

691
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,320
adversary that targets kirk

692
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,880
or other supermarkets on the island and

693
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
you're really curious you know what it

694
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,440
is you might be missing here

695
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
maybe it's the adversary that keeps you

696
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
up at night you know who is it that

697
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,039
you're really afraid of you think

698
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
they're going to overwhelm your existing

699
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,320
defenses

700
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
or maybe it's just who you've got an

701
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
intelligence gap about you know you're

702
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
really curious about a particular

703
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,159
adversary

704
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,400
there's sort of no wrong answer here

705
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,039
needs to be based on your own priorities

706
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
i'm going to use for the rest of this

707
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
talk though adversary keeps you up at

708
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,840
night so i'm going to be using for my

709
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
examples uh turla

710
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,640
tarla

711
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,840
is a

712
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
claim to be russian actor

713
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,919
that has been active a long long time

714
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,320
since at least the 90s

715
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
and has

716
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,080
is often one of the first users of

717
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,000
really advanced technical techniques

718
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
so you're going to build up an adversary

719
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
profile based on cyber threat

720
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,120
intelligence and again there was some

721
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
different ways to do this i'm going to

722
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
follow uh just going through

723
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
information that attack has released and

724
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
i'm going to do this for building up a

725
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,039
profile but building up attack

726
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,799
techniques for a specific adversary

727
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
and so we've given a lot of information

728
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,039
that you can use to do this for free

729
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,440
if you go to attacks group pages

730
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,279
where we've built up profiles for over

731
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,159
100 adversaries based on mapping open

732
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,520
source public threat intelligence

733
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,840
reports that we've already analyzed

734
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
but you can also do your own there's a

735
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,279
lot of open source intelligence reports

736
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,039
out there there's no way we get to all

737
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,240
of them

738
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
you can use the intelligence that you've

739
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,159
paid for a lot of you probably have

740
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,880
commercial cti providers you know that

741
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,000
are going to be information that you

742
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,840
can't just get out on

743
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,960
the open network put that to use

744
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
you actually add that into your

745
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
intelligence picture

746
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
if you have your own threat intelligence

747
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
if you have previous encounters with an

748
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,559
adversary

749
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
absolutely use it

750
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
we we a lot of times see people using

751
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
just the information from attack or just

752
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
free information

753
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
not using the information they already

754
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,159
know which is probably better

755
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,000
it's it's what you have that you know

756
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,880
about your own space

757
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
so i'm talking about mapping from these

758
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,399
public threat intelligence reports this

759
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
is the process i'm talking about

760
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,360
this is an example report from 2018 done

761
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,520
by the ncc group

762
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,320
on apt-15

763
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
so just getting in it's all pros it's

764
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,200
not written in any sort of structured

765
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
language

766
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,000
and what we're doing behind the scenes

767
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
and what you can do with your own threat

768
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
intelligence reporting we're going

769
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
through we're identifying behaviors in

770
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
here the highlights in yellow

771
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,000
and then we're figuring out what attack

772
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,679
techniques map to them

773
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,080
so creating batch scripts is windows

774
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,679
command shell t105903

775
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,240
uh creating windows run keys is register

776
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,240
run key startup folder t157401

777
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,200
and we can go through and do this now it

778
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,399
isn't going to be something that you can

779
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,399
just do off the top of your head uh

780
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
you're just going to sit down and go i

781
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,120
know it's t

782
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,880
1059.003 but there's structure processes

783
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
for doing this we've put out training

784
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,120
online for free it's been out for a

785
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,799
couple of years through both

786
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,399
youtube and cybury it's free either way

787
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,840
and we worked with department of

788
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,679
homeland security cisa

789
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,159
to put out a guide that actually also

790
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,760
walks through the process of doing this

791
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,919
so back to that matrix view

792
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
i'm taking all the techniques that

793
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,039
we have out there in public on the

794
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,600
groups page for turla

795
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
so this is the picture we have

796
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,960
again

797
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,120
not to focus on the specific techniques

798
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,360
it's small i'll zoom in on some portions

799
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
in a little bit

800
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,120
but just to show you the shape of it

801
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,840
so some things we can gather just by

802
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,399
looking at the the field of blue here we

803
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,000
can see there's blue under a lot of

804
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
different tactics

805
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,720
so maybe we've got an intel picture

806
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,799
that's giving us an idea of what an

807
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
adversary is doing on multiple parts of

808
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,480
an intrusion that's probably good

809
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
and you can see that we've got some

810
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
breath as well

811
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
under a lot of the different tactics

812
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
here we know a lot of the different ways

813
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,399
they're doing you see a lot under

814
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,960
discovery which is absolutely critical

815
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,840
for

816
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,760
doing deception

817
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,000
and so i'll dive into some of those

818
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,279
tactics in just a second

819
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
so i said we wanted preconceptions and

820
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
expectations

821
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
but that's behaviors

822
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,840
how are we getting from one to another

823
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,919
we can do a lot of inference here

824
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
now there's danger in doing that we're

825
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
inserting our own opinions we're

826
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,080
inserting a new risk of bias here but

827
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,679
again we're unlikely to have that direct

828
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,320
intelligence we can't ask the adversary

829
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,760
what do you think

830
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,919
so say for example we see that terla

831
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,399
does browser bookmark discovery that

832
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
means that they're going in and dumping

833
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,360
a local web browser's bookmarks stealing

834
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
them taking them back home what can we

835
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,399
infer from that

836
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
let's start with the obvious

837
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,600
they assume that there's a browser at

838
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,039
least on some of the systems that

839
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,840
they're hacking

840
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,919
the adversary assumes that there's a

841
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,000
browser that has bookmarks

842
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
okay you know that's that's pretty

843
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
obvious

844
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
but it's told us something but something

845
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
maybe a little bit deeper

846
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,120
the adversary probably expects an

847
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
interactive user you don't have browser

848
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,799
bookmarks

849
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,039
on many servers you don't have people

850
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
sitting down

851
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
and doing that kind of activity so you

852
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,399
know maybe they assume a active

853
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
interactive user something we consider

854
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,360
as we build for them

855
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,159
another technique is that the adversary

856
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,039
uses virtualization sandbox evasion

857
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,279
basically if they see the presence of a

858
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
virtual machine they bug out what does

859
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,760
that tell us

860
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,519
well they probably expect not to be in a

861
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,039
virtual machine if they're in the place

862
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,480
they want to be

863
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,080
and this this can actually be hard for

864
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,840
honey potting because the natural thing

865
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,640
is to build up a lot of virtual machines

866
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,440
and obviously it also tells us that they

867
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
have some belief that a virtual machine

868
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,720
might be bad it's probably because

869
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
they've gotten caught in the sandbox

870
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,360
before

871
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,039
and in a lot of cases they're actually

872
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,360
looking specifically for virtualbox

873
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,600
so you see some of the evidence of a

874
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,120
past sandbox interaction

875
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,760
so we can do that across the different

876
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
techniques we've seen but it's time to

877
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,480
start developing a cover story

878
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,559
a cover story is what the target of the

879
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,919
deception should perceive and believe

880
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,360
it's not something we get to tell the

881
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
adversary we don't

882
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,919
say hey so you've broken in today

883
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,240
our cover story is

884
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,120
no it's what your deception is built in

885
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
line with that you're trying to get them

886
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
to believe on their own

887
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,440
on top of that generally the most

888
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
convincing cover stories are based on

889
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
what the opponent already believes and

890
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
wants to believe

891
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,559
so the closer your cover story is to

892
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,159
what the adversary thinks that they're

893
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,000
getting themselves into

894
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,080
the more likely you are for success and

895
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,039
that's just basic human psychology

896
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,240
so how do we know what the adversary

897
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,840
expects well we're going to leverage the

898
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
intelligence we've been building

899
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,519
the other thing we are probably doing

900
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,039
with a cover story

901
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
is dealing with limitations in what we

902
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,039
can do

903
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,840
so

904
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,679
you might want to build a deception

905
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,679
environment that is the same size as

906
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
your real it network with as many fake

907
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,840
users as you have on your real setup

908
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,880
if you have the same budget as your it

909
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,399
organization

910
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,320
and the same budget to pay for all the

911
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,080
people to sit there and type into your

912
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
system that's great

913
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,279
i i want to come work for you

914
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,960
but i don't have that budget and nobody

915
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
else does either and so we need to

916
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
account for why there might not be as

917
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,600
many systems

918
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,360
so i'm going to look a little bit more

919
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
at some of the techniques they've used

920
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,159
as i develop my cover story what what i

921
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
might need to fit into

922
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
so if we look again at terla and how

923
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,960
they do initial access how they

924
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
initially try to get into a network we

925
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
see they're doing things like drive by

926
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,679
compromise

927
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,559
they're

928
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,240
infecting websites they're setting them

929
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,440
up so that if i visit them with a

930
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,679
browser they're getting into our system

931
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,039
they're doing things like spear phishing

932
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,399
attachment

933
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,000
and they're just using valid accounts

934
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,640
they're logging in from the outside

935
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,360
so from a few of these i can infer that

936
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,879
turley might be assuming that we have an

937
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,560
email system again

938
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,239
fairly obvious but it gives us

939
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,320
information on how to build out

940
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,079
and that they're seeing end user system

941
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,679
something you need for drive by

942
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,359
compromise or spare phishing attachment

943
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,399
to actually succeed

944
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,480
i can go back to those discovery

945
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,079
techniques

946
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,079
and i can see what sorts of things that

947
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,918
they're actually digging for on the

948
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,199
environment

949
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
so i see it they're they're looking at

950
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,399
files that's basically true of

951
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,239
everything you're looking at processes

952
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
looking at the registry

953
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,760
i see that they're doing remote system

954
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,040
discovery

955
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,639
and net system network connection

956
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,800
discovery so remote system discovery

957
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,079
means they're looking for other

958
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,599
computers on the network that they've

959
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,679
landed on system network connection

960
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,800
discovery they're looking for

961
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,560
connections out to other computers on

962
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
that network from where they've landed

963
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,520
so we can probably infer from that that

964
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,680
turle is expecting multiple systems

965
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
they're doing a lot of digging to try to

966
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,440
see what other computers are there

967
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,720
so let's start to build an example cover

968
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,079
story and again you know i'm only

969
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,839
looking at little pieces of this uh

970
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,680
example covers a real cover story is

971
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,119
going to be much more fleshed out than

972
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,079
this so you know we maybe we built the

973
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,520
acme corp

974
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
it's a small subsidiary of an existing

975
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
company located in camana bay

976
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,320
i will call it dart

977
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,960
has a dozen users each with their own

978
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,119
windows desktop on a domain

979
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,680
has its own email and file servers etc

980
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,560
etc etc trying to fit into

981
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,240
our picture that we built up from our

982
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,440
intelligence

983
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,119
at the same time accounting for a

984
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,839
limited budget we're a subsidiary we're

985
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,560
a smaller project we're just a lab

986
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,599
why is it that when adversary targeted

987
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,400
the bigger parent they found themselves

988
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,079
in the smaller space

989
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
and so this is our opportunity to

990
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,200
explain that away

991
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,560
our next step is that we need to

992
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
determine how to actually sell that

993
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,040
cover story to an adversary

994
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,800
so a deception environment you can think

995
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,880
of like a movie set

996
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,119
adversaries have very limited points of

997
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
view in how they observe the environment

998
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
they've landed in all they've got is

999
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
their command and control channel

1000
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
probably cobalt strike these days but

1001
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
it could be a lot of different pieces of

1002
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
software out there

1003
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,000
and so it's like a movie set you've got

1004
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,920
the sets that you can build

1005
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,079
around where the adversary actually is

1006
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,599
and environment

1007
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,520
and they've got their camera angles that

1008
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,160
they work through and perceive

1009
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,560
and so they can't tell what's behind it

1010
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
if you've properly built the movie set

1011
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,560
so i'm going to introduce another

1012
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,280
concept that's common from classical

1013
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,359
deception and how to do this and that's

1014
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,960
a denial and deception methods matrix

1015
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
and again my friends from the engage

1016
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,160
team recently put out a worksheet for

1017
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,359
actually doing uh denial and deception

1018
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
uh methods matrix

1019
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
and so this is broken up into four

1020
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
quadrants

1021
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,320
we first got deception objects we've got

1022
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,280
facts so the true things about our

1023
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
company and our environment and we've

1024
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,760
got fictions the lies that we're telling

1025
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,839
to an adversary

1026
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,520
and we can do one of two things we can

1027
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,800
either do deception or denial deception

1028
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
is where we are revealing

1029
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
and choosing to reveal that fact or

1030
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
fiction to an adversary denial is where

1031
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,720
we're concealing a fact or fiction from

1032
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
an adversary

1033
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
so some of the types of facts that we

1034
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
might reveal to an adversary maybe we

1035
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,200
want to use the true network information

1036
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,680
about our company so an adversary knows

1037
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,119
what our domain is

1038
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,359
they know what our ip range is aaron

1039
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,800
tells them

1040
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,760
and so

1041
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
maybe we don't have any reason to

1042
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,440
conceal that in our environment we just

1043
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,599
want to show it it adds to the realism

1044
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,640
helps sell the story

1045
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,560
maybe we've got some information that we

1046
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,760
can add to it might already be public

1047
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
that we can put into the system let them

1048
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,240
steal give them a warm fuzzy about their

1049
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,640
success without us actually having to

1050
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,560
lose anything

1051
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
another possible option maybe you want

1052
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
to selectively remediate we want to show

1053
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
them what it would truly look like if we

1054
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
were cleaning them out of a system to

1055
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,200
see how they react

1056
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
and then there are the fictions we might

1057
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,240
want to reveal

1058
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,480
so maybe we show them fake systems and

1059
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
we build out other computers in the

1060
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
environment to make it look bigger we

1061
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
might give them fake information that

1062
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,760
fits into our cover story

1063
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,359
there are facts that we might need to

1064
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,680
hide like whatever software we have on

1065
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,839
the end system that's watching them

1066
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,680
maybe you want to call that something

1067
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,000
really benign running in the windows

1068
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,480
processes works for them we can use it

1069
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
too

1070
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
and then conceal fiction's a sort of the

1071
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,880
usually forgotten corner uh it's things

1072
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
like the optic around the deception

1073
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,320
hiding that you're doing all this stuff

1074
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
and so then we want to fill this out to

1075
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,920
actually work with our cover story and

1076
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,320
the intelligence we have

1077
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,599
so again back to our discovery

1078
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,200
techniques

1079
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
i'm going to start with focusing in on

1080
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,480
one of the two techniques i pointed out

1081
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,760
before remote system discovery

1082
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,680
this is zoomed in to the actual attack

1083
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,800
technique

1084
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
it's again they're looking for other

1085
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
local systems in the network

1086
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,880
and so what are some fictions and facts

1087
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,640
that we can work with on this

1088
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,560
well we can expose fake systems on the

1089
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,720
network we can give them

1090
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
remote systems to discover

1091
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
and we also don't want them to remotely

1092
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,839
discover our logging server you know

1093
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,680
whatever is is collecting our pcap

1094
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,599
whatever is collecting our logs we want

1095
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,200
to hide that from them doing this

1096
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,839
behavior

1097
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
so system network connection discovery

1098
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
finding out what local connections

1099
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,040
already exist on the end system

1100
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
so we want to maybe create connections

1101
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,359
to a target host let them find

1102
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,240
information to our fiction

1103
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
and again maybe we want to hide our

1104
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,920
logging system here we've got a long

1105
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
running connection to our logging system

1106
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
we don't want them to find that when

1107
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
they're doing netstat and so find ways

1108
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,280
to hide that

1109
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,040
so we can go back and start adding each

1110
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
of these things we find to our denial

1111
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,119
and deception method matrix we're

1112
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,520
building up a bigger and bigger picture

1113
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
that tells us exactly what we need to

1114
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
design

1115
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,359
now it's finally time to build it so i

1116
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,440
talked in the beginning about we often

1117
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,720
see the cart before the horse and

1118
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,079
deception people have a technical

1119
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,359
capability

1120
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,640
and they then try to backfill into it

1121
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,760
this is where you get to start to play

1122
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,440
so you're going to be implementing the

1123
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,079
denial and deception matrix in line with

1124
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,000
your cover story you're going to design

1125
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,599
and build the revealed facts and

1126
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,119
fictions you're going to build

1127
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,599
concealment around denied facts and

1128
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,280
fictions

1129
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
and we're going to go a little bit

1130
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
deeper into how our adversary is

1131
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,119
operating look at the procedures because

1132
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,200
we want to even farther match adversary

1133
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
expectations in selling the story to

1134
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,439
them

1135
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,280
so one of the two techniques i just used

1136
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
remote system discovery what is terla

1137
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,520
actually doing

1138
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
well in most cases we see them actually

1139
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
just doing net view and net view domain

1140
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,839
so they're looking at what systems have

1141
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,119
been seen in windows browsing behavior

1142
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,359
okay you know we we can take that into

1143
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,279
account now we build our system

1144
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,800
so i said we wanted to expose fake

1145
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,119
systems on a network or domain

1146
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,520
we they appear to expect view and net

1147
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
view domain to show them something

1148
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,319
and said let's make that happen

1149
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,720
and that that might sound trivial but it

1150
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,440
turns out if you build a windows network

1151
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,040
from scratch you know fresh windows

1152
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,720
domain you're building your brand new

1153
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
honeypot you know your windows 11 your

1154
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,800
current version of windows server

1155
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,440
nephew might not actually do anything

1156
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,720
it turns out a lot of the browse

1157
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,960
functionality that causes that to show

1158
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,599
information tends to come from croft

1159
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,839
from a network that was built you know

1160
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,000
decade or decades ago

1161
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,839
so you actually have to go back and turn

1162
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,000
some of that on and win a server

1163
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
manually to start making it look like

1164
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,359
it's got that aged and feel

1165
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,440
let's look at another that other

1166
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,119
technique so

1167
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
uh system network connection discovery

1168
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
what are they actually doing here well

1169
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,599
they're doing netstat and

1170
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,640
that in itself is a little bit

1171
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,880
interesting since most adversaries do

1172
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,359
netstat a o

1173
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,240
net use net file net session and they've

1174
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
got their own backdoors that are doing

1175
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,000
rpc doing api calls with get tcp table

1176
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
so a lot of different things to be able

1177
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,839
to see persistent connections that are

1178
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,040
on the end system

1179
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,760
so we figured out that we wanted to

1180
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,520
create connections to the target host

1181
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,359
but not have them see the connections to

1182
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,480
our logger

1183
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,560
and they expect to see some a number of

1184
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,599
these connect tools to actually work

1185
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,680
so what can we do

1186
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,760
so if we're able to create connections

1187
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,319
to some of our fake systems

1188
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,560
with net use

1189
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,079
we can create something that actually be

1190
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,119
seen by several of these tools it shows

1191
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,839
up in the net use table it shows up as a

1192
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,560
persistent tcp connection

1193
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,480
i maybe want to use something like udp

1194
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
for logging you get out of having that

1195
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,880
long term persistent tcp connection off

1196
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,040
the system

1197
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,400
finally time to have some fun

1198
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,680
to deploy the deception

1199
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,839
so if what you were trying to do here is

1200
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,319
to detect the adversary it's time to put

1201
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,760
it out there in the wild put it out

1202
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
there for them to find hopefully trip

1203
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,400
over

1204
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,680
and set off an alert for you to respond

1205
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,440
to and deal with them being in your

1206
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
network

1207
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,800
if your goal is intelligence gathering

1208
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,280
it's time to wait for an opportunity

1209
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,880
in most cases sticking a honey pot just

1210
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,800
out there facing the internet

1211
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
doesn't usually catch the flies you

1212
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,920
really want

1213
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,760
and so a lot of cases it's looking for

1214
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,400
the right spear fish the right website

1215
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,720
that's been infected to go visit and

1216
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,078
bring them into your space

1217
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,680
finally

1218
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,839
this is all wasted effort or might be

1219
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,000
wasted effort if we're not actually

1220
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,480
gathering intelligence on our adversary

1221
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,079
and that's no matter what type of

1222
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,480
deception you're trying to do here

1223
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
if you're trying to detect the adversary

1224
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,079
well the main intelligence you probably

1225
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,960
want is are they here or not yes or no

1226
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,400
as well as sort of where they're coming

1227
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,960
from anything else about them

1228
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,720
and so you need your detection alerting

1229
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,240
capability you need this going back to

1230
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
your socks setting off the flashing

1231
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
lights and warning bells

1232
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
not just sitting there you know hoping

1233
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,119
that something's going to happen and not

1234
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,160
actually watch it

1235
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
we might be gathering what techniques

1236
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
are used by adversaries hopefully you

1237
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,079
share those back with attack we'd really

1238
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,680
appreciate it

1239
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,440
but you know doing things like host

1240
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,599
network monitoring setting up maybe an

1241
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,680
edr similar to what you have on the rest

1242
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,079
of your network things like sysmon

1243
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,119
looking at different processes being run

1244
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,400
you might be getting into command and

1245
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,839
control decoding maybe you're able to

1246
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
decrypt the adversary's channels and

1247
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
actually watch over their shoulder as

1248
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,119
they operate

1249
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,040
any of these options you might be able

1250
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,880
to gather a ton of information from an

1251
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
adversary

1252
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,640
i've been focused completely on

1253
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,880
behaviors today i haven't said a word

1254
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,040
about indicators a compromise just been

1255
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,359
talking about how adversaries act

1256
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,839
but fresh indicators of compromise can

1257
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,240
be extremely valuable even if they're

1258
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,960
not in attack at all

1259
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,079
so we use often david bianco's pyramid

1260
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,400
of pain to discuss the value of

1261
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,040
different types of indicators everything

1262
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,000
from

1263
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
how and how power

1264
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,000
how painful they are for an adversary to

1265
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,079
change starting with things like hash

1266
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,119
values

1267
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,280
where an adversary can have a single bit

1268
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
to a file completely change it you'll

1269
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,359
never see the same hash again ip

1270
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
addresses where they can just switch to

1271
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,920
a new host

1272
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,800
domain names they need to buy something

1273
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,880
up through behaviors which tend to be

1274
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,760
locked in over long periods of time

1275
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,920
if you have the ip address of the

1276
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,280
command and control server that an

1277
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,760
adversary is using right now though

1278
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,079
that can save your bacon

1279
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,240
it can be really important even though

1280
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,598
it is a fairly fragile indicator

1281
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,920
then finally you know we started off

1282
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
with gathering intelligence figuring out

1283
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,640
who our pro

1284
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
priority adversary is useless

1285
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,520
intelligence so you saw them take a left

1286
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
you know go through that door that you

1287
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
didn't plan on having the movie set

1288
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,960
behind well okay

1289
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,720
maybe that's where we focus our efforts

1290
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,640
next time make sure it looks better or

1291
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,400
maybe make sure that door is closed next

1292
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,440
time

1293
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,599
we can use that to build back and

1294
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,599
actually improve our deception

1295
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,359
each and every time we do this

1296
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,800
since the process i've just worked

1297
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,960
through we're going from figuring out

1298
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,640
who our adversary is building up

1299
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
intelligence on them figuring out our

1300
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,480
cover story we want to tell them

1301
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,160
figuring out what we're going to lie to

1302
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
the adversary about what truths we're

1303
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
going to show them build it out put them

1304
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,640
in it and gather our intelligence

1305
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
so some takeaways are hopefully

1306
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,960
coming away from with this

1307
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,119
we can take historical deception

1308
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,599
planning and apply it to cyber processes

1309
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,200
we can use things that we already knew

1310
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,480
how to do

1311
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,160
and do cyber security a little bit

1312
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,240
better by using them

1313
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,160
i hopefully convinced you that there's

1314
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,760
some value to cyber threat intelligence

1315
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,040
some things we can do by actually

1316
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
knowing our adversaries what sorts of

1317
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,559
things our adversaries do when they're

1318
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,920
in environment

1319
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,160
and so for both cyber deception and our

1320
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,559
general defense

1321
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,160
and you know i'm using attack in a

1322
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,400
really strange way here compared with

1323
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
you know how a lot of companies are

1324
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,680
putting attack to use

1325
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,599
and so hopefully demonstration of some

1326
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,920
attack uses beyond traditional defensive

1327
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,880
practices as well

1328
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,359
that's me that's where i am on social

1329
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,480
media

1330
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,880
if anyone wants any stickers for attack

1331
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
i've got them on the corner up here on

1332
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,760
the front table

1333
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,119
and i've got a couple minutes for

1334
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,920
questions i believe

1335
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,480
dead silence colada

1336
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,760
i'll repeat the question for the

1337
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,160
streaming

1338
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,960
the college question was what size

1339
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,040
organization do we see effectively using

1340
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,960
this

1341
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,760
it depends so things like honey tokens

1342
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,839
really simple deceptive practices like

1343
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,240
putting fake information in systems

1344
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,319
we see from all sorts of size companies

1345
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,160
we do see organizations that really have

1346
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,400
their act together want to take another

1347
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,359
step

1348
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,720
and that that's where they're getting

1349
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,760
into

1350
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,839
a lot of the more building out

1351
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,000
large-scale deception environments

1352
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,960
anyone can technically do it but

1353
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,440
the intelligence necessary to maintain

1354
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,880
that the different types of roles you

1355
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,319
need to actually be able to monitor and

1356
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,880
build it do tend to come from larger

1357
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,240
more more resourced organizations

1358
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,680
and so one of the reasons why i brought

1359
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,359
up engage at the beginning is engage

1360
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,000
actually has a broad set of options

1361
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,839
broader than sort of the really deep

1362
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,079
planning i'm doing today that smaller

1363
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,839
companies may also be able to bring to

1364
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,839
bear

1365
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,079
anyone else

1366
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,680
okay

1367
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,170
well thank you very much came in

1368
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:49,619
[Applause]

1369
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
you
