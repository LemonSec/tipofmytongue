32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
thank you jane

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,159
it's great to be

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,520
back here in the cayman this is my

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
second time to visit the cayman islands

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,079
it's a it's beautiful it's one of my

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920
favorite places to visit in the world

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
the island is so beautiful food the

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
people

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
the scenery as you well know the beaches

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
it's uh the reefs are just amazing here

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
being able to see all the stingrays and

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
starfish it's just uh it's an amazing

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,119
place you have here

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,880
so this talk we're going to talk about

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
space systems and cyber security

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
and we're not i'm going to not do a

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
focus on the ground system we're going

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
to focus on events that have actually

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
happened in space primarily

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,280
around cyber because there's so much in

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
the news these days when you have with

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,080
uh ukraine

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
spacex biosat there's a lot of

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
conversation about that in the news

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
and then all the satellites that are

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,680
going up in space providing

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
internet services from space

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
all the new launch capabilities i

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
wanted to go and put some coverage on

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160
what

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,879
what's been happening in the past up to

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
this point

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
with uh space

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,720
and cyber but but focused on the

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
satellite portion of it and

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
and i'm going to talk about the space

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
station as well

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
but

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
so when we talk about space

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
if you come from an enterprise

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
background or telco service provider

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
background you're familiar with a

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
network operations center your security

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,480
operations center where you're

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
monitoring the health and status of your

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
network infrastructure maybe you have it

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
in the cloud where you you're collecting

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,480
all your telemetry data and you know the

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,599
health and status of the network

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,200
infrastructure your apps your servers

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
etc well similarly for uh

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,879
for systems that are in orbit in space

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
organizations similar similarly to say

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
nasa here in this example they have

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
ground stations

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
around the world located so that they

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
can can continuously monitor no matter

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,400
where the spacecraft is in orbit they

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
can always go in uh send commands to

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
pull health and status maybe send

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
commands to change orbit pull

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
information imaging from a payload

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
that's on a spacecraft

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
satellite so

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
that's called the ground station ground

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
system

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
for the spacecraft

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
now what's really interesting now is

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
everybody's talking about the cloud i

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
mean everyone is moving to the cloud

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
well similarly

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
space systems are as well

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
and it's called and what that's commonly

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
referred to in the marketing is ground

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
station as a service but i've read the

107
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,680
other day where they're talking about

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
space as a service as well

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
is a new acronym that you're going to

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
probably hear more about

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
but ground station as a service

112
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,439
is where instead of having these private

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
ground stations

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,560
similar to having you know your own

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
private network operations center or a

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,279
private security operations center

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,639
the all these new space 2.0 these new

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,600
space

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
commercial organizations that are coming

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,000
online many of them are pushing those

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
services to the cloud where amazon aws

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
google i was reading that google is

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
going to provide the services to spacex

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,919
for the startling satellites

125
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,280
and so they may eventually offer

126
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
additional commercial services but and

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,759
then microsoft azure they have their

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
orbit solution that they're offering

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
cloud-based

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
space services and there's a company

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
called kubos

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
they have a application that they run in

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
aws called major time

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
and uh and then there's a leaf space out

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
of italy and there's another one i can't

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
recall the name of that i've read about

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
recently out of portugal that is going

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,440
to offer a cloud-based service so space

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
is going to the cloud so it's really

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
interesting

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
what's happening there but also call out

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
image to you might find of interest

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
is that the cloud is also moving up into

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
orbit there's a company called leo cloud

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
where they're going to put cloud-based

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
services

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,880
in space so that they can do processing

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
and analysis in space before they send

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
data to the ground and other similar

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
services and

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
i was reading where hp has designed a

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
new server for space

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
and they have to be special servers and

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
computers have to be specially designed

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
for space because it's

156
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,639
there's actually weather in space

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,479
due to

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
the atmosphere and the sun because it's

159
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
sending all kinds of radiation and

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,600
particles

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
into space that can affect the computer

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
systems and we'll talk about that and

163
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
mess it up so those the hp server is

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
specially designed

165
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
to provide a server in space and then i

166
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,360
was reading there's another company

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,759
called aim ramos out of israel and they

168
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,240
provide they've designed a two terabyte

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
hard drive

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,199
uh storage system for space here just

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
recently so that's going so now we're

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
going to have cloud in space eventually

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,919
which is going to open up a lot of ideas

174
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
of how you do forensics incident

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
response things that we would do on the

176
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,680
ground get that that's hard enough on

177
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
the cloud on the ground but now we're

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
going to do it in space so it's going to

179
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
be a lot of interesting activities in

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
the future with cyber it's going to be

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,039
really exciting a lot of opportunities

182
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,560
so when we talk about orbits

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
spacex and uh

184
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
what uh

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
some of the other

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
companies are doing

187
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
that you read about most frequently with

188
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
the small satellites the cubesats is in

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
leo the low earth orbit

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
and and that's up to like 2 000

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
kilometers

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,880
that's good that's what you're

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
predominantly reading about uh

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
all the frequent launches that uh the

195
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,759
spacex is sending up with their rockets

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,280
most of those satellites are going up

197
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,759
into the leo orbit and that's where

198
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,840
like space station is located in leo

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
it's closer to the earth and it spins

200
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
roughly those satellites are rotating

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
around the earth about about every four

202
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
hours roughly

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
they're rotating spinning around the

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
earth but when you go to geo

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
that is the satellites that you're

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,120
probably familiar with when you get

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
cable tv services some of your voice

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,599
services

209
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
those type of services are those

210
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,759
satellites are pointing directly at the

211
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
same spot same region of the earth and

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,880
in italy orbits

213
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
as the earth orbits up in geo and then

214
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
you have mio and

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
keo the high earth orbit the medium

216
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
earth orbit but primarily what you're

217
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
reading about in the news is the low

218
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,639
earth orbit

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
and then the geo orbit

220
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,280
so from a threat standpoint again

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,639
everything in the news here lately if

222
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,599
you've been following with the

223
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,879
activities in

224
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,039
ukraine

225
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
there was the recent attack they expect

226
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
they said that the that the russians

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
attacked via side and took out

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
the user terminals for

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
for uh

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,879
for the viasat internet terminals like

231
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
5000 plus or 5 million

232
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
might have been the number of user

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,039
terminals and they got in through a

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,479
through the network management network

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
for the user terminals

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,039
and so they were able to degrade and

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,919
deny service for those end users

238
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,958
and they weren't able to use the

239
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,640
spacecraft but that happened on the user

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
part of the network but there's other

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,880
attacks like a deception where somebody

242
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,519
might be spoofing information

243
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,640
uh and uh say you know messing with gps

244
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
messing with timing and location where

245
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
where you uh

246
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
lose

247
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
track of where you are and say like if

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
you're a ship floating around you might

249
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,839
be getting

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
your information spoofed so you don't

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
you're not showing up where you're

252
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,240
supposed to be

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
uh and then this there could be

254
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
temporary disruptions

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
like lasers microwave some kind of

256
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,880
directed energy attack in like a

257
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,959
electronic warfare where it's it's

258
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,920
jamming the signal and the signal it

259
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
will be jammed and unusable but then it

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
comes back as soon as the power is

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,800
removed

262
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,479
and so it'll be a temporary disruption

263
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
there's been a lot a lot of talk here

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
lately about the asad attacks where

265
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
that's been tested where's actually a

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
missile shot at the at the satellite and

267
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
taking out the uh the spacecraft which

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
ends up causing a great deal of debris

269
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,560
and that just totally destroys the

270
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
spacecraft but also create adds to the

271
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
debris field

272
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,000
that is a lot of people scientists are

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,279
worried about that eventually could

274
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
cause what they call a kessler syndrome

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
that if the debris field in space keeps

276
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
developing like it is that eventually

277
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
there could be a chain reaction where a

278
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
piece of debris hits a spacecraft or

279
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
another large piece of of debris and it

280
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
just starts

281
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
a chain reaction of debris creating

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
crashing into debris creating

283
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,720
additional debris until the whole low

284
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
earth orbit is unusable and that's

285
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
called kessler syndrome

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
and there's because of the complete

287
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,040
destruction of spacecraft there's a

288
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
concern about there and plus there's

289
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
junk that's just been left up there like

290
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
rockets and satellites that have not

291
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
fallen from space yet

292
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
and then and then there's other attacks

293
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
like i think i mentioned you know lasers

294
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,320
and

295
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
in the microwave but primarily what

296
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
we're going to talk about with this talk

297
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
though is like i mentioned jamming

298
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
electronic warfare

299
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
the the field of electronic warfare and

300
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
cyber are converging together where

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
where somebody might be trying to jam

302
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
your uh

303
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
your radio frequency channel with with

304
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,360
high power jammers

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,240
uh

306
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
malware i've got some examples of

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
malware in space you might be surprised

308
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,560
with their

309
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
malware is in space

310
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
and the spoofing and going after the

311
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,279
the control system payload

312
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,959
because the satellite is going to have

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
two components typically there's going

314
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
to be the computer

315
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
portion of the satellite that controls

316
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
how the satellite is flown and the

317
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,560
overall health and status of that

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
satellite and keeping it in orbit

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
and then there's the payload

320
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
that is the computer system that

321
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
controls what the mission is of that

322
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,640
satellite you know if it's taking

323
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
imagery

324
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
if it's communications what have you

325
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
that would be in the payload

326
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
and then we're going to talk about

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
attacks like replay and being able to do

328
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
hijacking and eavesdropping which is uh

329
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,399
a lot easier than you may realize

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
because there's a there's a lot of

331
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
misconception that everything is

332
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
encrypted it is not all encrypted

333
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
and i will talk about some real-world

334
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
examples of that so

335
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
again what we're showing in this slide

336
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
is

337
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
when we start talking about attacks

338
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
against space systems if it's like

339
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
electronic warfare

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,480
things like that it might be easily to

341
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
recover from those attacks because the

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,920
the rf the radio frequency energy is

343
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
applied it jams the signal and when it

344
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
go in it goes away

345
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,639
once that signal is removed and we've

346
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,000
been reading a lot about it then in the

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
news here lately but when as you move to

348
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
the right you start getting into kinetic

349
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
attacks maybe a microwave attack

350
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
a microwave attack a high energy

351
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
directed energy microwave attack could

352
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
possibly damage permanently damage the

353
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
spacecraft or

354
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
lasers could have a really strong laser

355
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,880
that gets pointed to the spacecraft and

356
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
totally disable some of its capabilities

357
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
or

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
maybe do and do irreparable damage to it

359
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
or of course shooting a missile at it

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
there's like four countries right now

361
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
that have proven that they can hit a mis

362
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,639
hit a satellite in space india china the

363
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
u.s and russia are the four

364
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
that have actually been been able to

365
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,360
destroy a satellite in space so

366
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
hopefully we'll get some treaties in

367
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
place that we'll quit doing that in

368
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
adding debris to the

369
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,399
to the leo space

370
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,480
some of the threat actors

371
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
the threat actors span the gamut similar

372
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
similar to other critical infrastructure

373
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
industries whether it's you know a

374
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
foreign military

375
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
some kid sitting at home on their

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,279
parents internet connection with you

377
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
know this time and i'm

378
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,560
in the high iq and a lot of curiosity

379
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,519
all the way up to terrorist

380
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
uh there's a there's a great deal of

381
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
talk that i've been reading here

382
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,279
recently where russia and china are

383
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
watching and seeing what's happened you

384
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,800
know where they were able to affect

385
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
viasat

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,199
but then

387
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,680
spacex and starling stepped in

388
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
and overcame the attacks that were used

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
against viasat and have been able to

390
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
bring the internet back up in ukraine

391
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,360
that's got a lot of people's attention

392
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
that that now hey what are we going to

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
do

394
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
when we want to go and you know exert

395
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
influence over a battlefield that how

396
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
we're going to deal with these thousands

397
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,399
of satellites that elon is putting up in

398
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,639
space so there's that's

399
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,760
and that's going to get into all those

400
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
different uh different attacks like the

401
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
lasers the microwave etc but then

402
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
there's but one of the top attacks of a

403
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
concern is cyber because if they can

404
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,600
find a way through the supply chain if

405
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
they get into the supply center chain

406
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
you know from your chips and software

407
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,240
all the way

408
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
through the process that's a broad

409
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
attack surface that somebody might be

410
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
good to but

411
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,399
but there's also

412
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
all the way down to the in to some kid

413
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
sitting at home on internet connection

414
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
because a lot of legacy satellite

415
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
communications are unencrypted

416
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
like a like everything

417
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
here on the ground it's best practices

418
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,920
to use use your own encryption and

419
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
verify but uh

420
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
it's not always encrypted

421
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
and the reason being is uh

422
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
because of space weather and we'll dive

423
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
more into that so you so you can set up

424
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
you can actually go and get a

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,600
software-defined radio if you're a

426
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
hobbyist and passively look at network

427
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
traffic we'll go into some

428
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
examples of that so that space threat

429
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
actors it's a pretty broad capability

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
there to just passively or actively

431
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,399
engage now i spent many years working on

432
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,240
red teams doing penetration testing i

433
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
got involved penetration testing in like

434
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
99 the early 2000s i got interested in

435
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
doing attack trees as a way to

436
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
develop a strategy

437
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,600
for the team

438
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
and for

439
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,360
for reporting so i like to i like to use

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,399
a whole attack tree mind mapping to

441
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
layout strategy so a real real simple

442
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,759
example if you're going to go after

443
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
somebody's satellite

444
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,880
you know you're maybe you want to go

445
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
after the ground station look at uh you

446
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,639
know you want to now analyze your

447
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
threats you know what is the insiders

448
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,079
you know some you know what is the

449
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,000
likelihood of one of your

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,639
insiders your engineers i t people

451
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
janitor someone getting turned

452
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,759
decided to work for the bad guys

453
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,120
you know what what is those trust

454
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
relationships out to the internet

455
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
that's kind of like what happened with

456
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
my understanding with viasat the net the

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,279
firewall vpn had a mis-configuration so

458
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,560
some they were able to come in over the

459
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,399
internet get a whole get through the

460
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,920
firewall vpn

461
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
and then upload some bad code that got

462
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,160
distributed to all the user terminals

463
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
so going through the ground station it's

464
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
theoretical

465
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
that they could might be possible at

466
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
some point to do a satellite to

467
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
satellite in space attack that's purely

468
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
theoretical i've not been able to read

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
anywhere where that's actually happened

470
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,320
but i've i have seen where a couple

471
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
papers where people are speculating on

472
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
satellite to satellite type attacks in

473
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
the future or

474
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
someone that's more sophisticated has

475
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
more resources might be able to go and

476
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
bring up their own unauthorized ground

477
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,079
station but typically what you're going

478
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
to see is someone is going to try to

479
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
find a way into the existing ground

480
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,040
station whether it's a private ground

481
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
station or

482
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,839
which i think is going to make it a lot

483
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
easier somebody's cloud ground station

484
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,959
because you know if they put it to the

485
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,119
cloud most most likely they're going to

486
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,000
have

487
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
remote internet access into it and

488
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,199
that's going to open up a whole big

489
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
broader attack services as this group

490
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
would know and understand

491
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
to export that trust relationship and

492
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,559
gain access to the spacecraft

493
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
i found this really interesting i

494
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
started doing this research about known

495
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,918
spacecraft attacks but apparently

496
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
there's a it's heavily speculated that

497
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
when stuxnet

498
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
attacked the iranian

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,799
nuclear program many years ago that when

500
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
stuxlet was spreading that it actually

501
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,160
somehow

502
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
got got into the ground station of a

503
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,679
cable tv

504
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
company satellite company in india and

505
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,640
took out the inside 4b satellite and

506
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
what what what is stated is that the

507
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
inside 4b

508
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
system was actually using the same

509
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,160
siemens plc controller

510
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
for uh

511
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,240
for uh the solar panels to rotate and

512
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
turn the solar panels that was using the

513
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
same poc and it had the wind cc system

514
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
on the ground so it was able to

515
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,320
turn the satellite so that

516
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
that uh it could destroy that spacecraft

517
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
and disabled it and so they lost service

518
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,840
now on the encrypted satellite

519
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,520
communications the reason the reason

520
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,440
that they're it's all not encrypted

521
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
is because

522
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,679
there's this space weather like there's

523
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
solar storms in space the sun is

524
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
constantly spewing out

525
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
particles ions electrons protons

526
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
all this stuff that you probably just

527
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
studied in modern physics

528
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
it's shooting that out across space

529
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,919
and

530
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
it goes back to einstein uh equation the

531
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
equivalency square it's got enough

532
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,360
energy that those little tiny

533
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
particles have enough energy

534
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
to fly when it was it is headed toward

535
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,880
uh out into the solar system toward

536
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
earth etcetera it hits those spacecraft

537
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
that not only can it degrade

538
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
economic and cause uh it can degrade the

539
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
material properties of a spacecraft

540
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,799
depending on how what the materials are

541
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
used on that spacecraft but if it can

542
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
get in there it could also inject itself

543
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
into the electronics

544
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,120
and it can do what what they call a

545
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
a single upset event where it can make

546
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
the ones and zeroes in an electronic

547
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,039
board

548
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,720
change and flip so it might have been

549
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
should have been a one but it flips to

550
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
zero and you know in this room everybody

551
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,720
understand encryption you start changing

552
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
ones and zeroes and flipping things well

553
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
what have we done we broke encryption

554
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
we've killed our encrypted connection

555
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
now we've got to reset it we gotta do we

556
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
gotta reboot you don't want to have to

557
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,400
be rebooting your computer in space

558
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
because you know you ain't like you can

559
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
walk down the hall to the data center

560
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
and and hard boot it when they don't

561
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
boot up clean right

562
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,240
a little bit more complicated when it's

563
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
you know

564
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
in leo or geo

565
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
so that's the reason not everybody does

566
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
encryption now you can use encryption

567
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,000
and it is heavily used by some

568
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,120
organizations but it drives up the cost

569
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
of hardening that equipment against the

570
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
radiation the hostile space weather you

571
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,880
got to go and put a special shielding

572
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
around that equipment

573
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
and manufacture it so that it can

574
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
survive at space

575
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
at that level

576
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
so and there's a lot of things out in

577
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
the open source where it's talked about

578
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
its best practices it's recommended but

579
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,720
they don't do it specifically because of

580
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,760
that because they don't want to lose

581
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,799
that

582
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
the

583
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,000
people who control the satellites do not

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
want to lose access to their satellites

585
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
due to a loss of encryption which makes

586
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
sense so so some do it sometimes the

587
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,880
lesson learned out of this where we're

588
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
going with this is if you're dependent

589
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
if your business

590
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
or you know your home network is using

591
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,320
uh satellite internet

592
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
if it's sensitive traffic if you're

593
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
under some kind of regulatory regulation

594
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
like you know health care privacy

595
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,280
information financial privacy

596
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,559
information you're using satellite

597
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,320
internet i'd be making sure it's

598
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
encrypted don't don't believe the sales

599
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,799
guys

600
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,320
i'd be encrypting my own traffic

601
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
an example of uh

602
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
some real world examples of unencrypted

603
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
traffic is in this case the navy had a

604
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,280
satellite was using uhf and some

605
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
creative

606
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
uh radio

607
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,679
people down in brazil discovered it and

608
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,080
they used the open unencrypted

609
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
satellite

610
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
that the navy was using for their radio

611
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,640
communications they turned it into a cb

612
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,799
radio network for themselves

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,799
and by the and eventually at some point

614
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,559
they found 39 people across

615
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
six states in brazil that were utilizing

616
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,559
it apparently after they rested that

617
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,080
bunch

618
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,520
more people came online and started

619
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,960
using it because everybody knew about it

620
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,400
and it was real easy to hack because it

621
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
was out there open you know if you

622
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
didn't want people to use it should had

623
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,480
it encrypted

624
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,799
now here's an example for malware with

625
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,440
this again showing that despite what all

626
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,919
the you know your isp might be telling

627
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,679
you that it's encrypted here's a real

628
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
world example where

629
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
it's not encrypted

630
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
some of it may be but not all of it in

631
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,640
this case

632
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,559
we have a piece of malware where you

633
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,240
know the malware's got its uh command

634
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
control got that two-way handshake of

635
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,600
signaling

636
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
between the uh the bot that's been

637
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,080
infected and the command control server

638
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
well these guys are pretty smart this is

639
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
a sophisticated attack i wish i was

640
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
smart enough to think about this

641
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,159
to come up with this idea

642
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,039
they would they would

643
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
the bot operators had their command

644
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
control server

645
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
they would go put their server out on

646
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
somewhat some satellite internet network

647
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
and just uh steal somebody's ip space

648
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
put it out there on somebody's ip space

649
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,679
just out there and squat out there

650
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,080
in like southern europe north africa

651
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
region middle east they would put that

652
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,679
put their server out there using

653
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,240
whatever arbitrary ip addresses that the

654
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,799
satellite internet company was using

655
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,039
and it would just wait

656
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
for uh they bought

657
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,200
whoever got infected to phone home and

658
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
then whenever they got a signal

659
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
that from a uh from somebody's computer

660
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
that had been infected it would get

661
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,320
sprayed down broadcast from the

662
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,799
satellite to everyone in that region of

663
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,200
the world and then the

664
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,480
the c2 server the malware server would

665
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,880
would send a connection back to that

666
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
infected user over a wire line so it was

667
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
an async communication so

668
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,600
you've got you know you're out there

669
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
trying to do threat hunting you're out

670
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
there trying to monitor and catch the

671
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
bad guys you're only going to see one

672
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
wave signal one signal is going to go

673
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
over a wire line and one signal is going

674
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
to go over the they coming in over the

675
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,360
satellite really really hard to detect

676
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,159
so

677
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,760
and that would not work if they were

678
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
using encryption

679
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
so it just that's a good example of

680
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,200
proving it ain't it's not all encrypted

681
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
and if it ain't encrypted

682
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,000
and you're using satellite internet

683
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,880
you know

684
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,240
better be using some encryption or

685
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,039
somebody's gonna be sitting out there

686
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
and looking at it i can tell you

687
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
it's a it's a lot easier there's a

688
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,880
there's a couple papers out on black hat

689
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
as well and on that on slideshare where

690
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,520
it broke down many years ago a gentleman

691
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,039
first published it i forget his name and

692
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
then it was published again a couple

693
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
years ago by another gentleman from they

694
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
graduated oxford university recently i

695
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
forget their names they published

696
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
there's a lot of information out there

697
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
about how to use salt like software fire

698
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,760
radio

699
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
really really cost effectively

700
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
as a hobbyist

701
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
bring up a capability to

702
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,919
to monitor

703
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
passively just passively just sit there

704
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
and listen like wire sharp

705
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
on a you know set up there on your

706
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,400
switch

707
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
uh sit there and passively monitor the

708
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,320
satellite traffic it's floating around

709
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
in space so you need to make sure your

710
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
stuff is encrypted because i've got a

711
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
project where

712
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
we're throwing something up like that

713
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,279
and just seeing what's out there and

714
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,520
what's all the noise

715
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,880
and it's really it's really amazing to

716
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
see

717
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
here's another example

718
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
during the iraq war there was insurgents

719
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,840
they were able to intercept

720
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
communications and decode satellite

721
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
communications they were unencrypted

722
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
and i mentioned earlier about that this

723
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
is this is something i believe is going

724
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,679
to be that we'll read about in the

725
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,039
future i haven't there's nothing out

726
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,000
there to say it's happened yet it's

727
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,919
purely theoretical but i'm thinking that

728
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,279
eventually we're going to be reading

729
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,480
about a

730
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,039
satellite to satellite attack in space

731
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,159
it's probably going to be it's going to

732
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,720
be easier to do with rf with the radio

733
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,880
frequency because that's more broader in

734
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
nature the signaling

735
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
but more and more

736
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,679
which is a good thing more and more the

737
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,200
communications are going to move to

738
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
optical where it's where they're using

739
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
free space optics where the lasers are

740
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
going to you're going to point lasers in

741
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
space at the spacecraft spacecraft the

742
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
spacecraft so it's going to be inner

743
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,919
side it's going to be optical and then

744
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,360
the spacecraft to the ground will be

745
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
optical and that's going to be a huge

746
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
improvement for security when it goes

747
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,480
optical because you won't be able to jam

748
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
it like as he's messed with it like you

749
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,120
can with a radio frequency because it's

750
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,960
a laser

751
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,880
it's a braiding so free space optics is

752
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,360
going to make it really really hard but

753
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
i'm just interested to see

754
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
if if that ever gets reported is

755
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
actually occurring

756
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
here's a

757
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,159
a real world example of a satellite this

758
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,559
this rosat satellite

759
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,600
was created to look into deep space

760
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
it was you know the scientists were

761
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,960
trying to go and study deep space see

762
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,360
what's going on out in out in the solar

763
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
system

764
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,360
and someone was able to find a way into

765
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
a ground system

766
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
and get from that ground system that

767
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
they they exploited trust relationships

768
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,159
and found their way into

769
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,760
were able to get go from the ground

770
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
system up to that satellite and turn

771
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
that satellite

772
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
toward the sun

773
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,200
and

774
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
damage the satellite's capability which

775
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
this kind of talk always drives me crazy

776
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
because it's like scada

777
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
industrial control systems scada you

778
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,159
know ot

779
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,679
why is this stuff

780
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,679
accessible from the internet to begin

781
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,520
with i mean who designs this stuff i

782
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,320
mean

783
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
that should never have been able for

784
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
someone to get remote access into that

785
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,480
sensitive network but

786
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
that's another that's just another rant

787
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
for later

788
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
another example is a landsat 7 satellite

789
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,679
in 2007 2008

790
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,480
it was hacked for uh

791
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,200
like 12 minutes

792
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
whoever the attackers were when they got

793
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
it when they got into the satellite

794
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
apparently they had full control

795
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
they had access

796
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,120
they had access to do whatever they want

797
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
to do basically like root level access

798
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,960
equivalent but it's that's about like me

799
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,080
getting root level access on a vms vax

800
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
box

801
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
you could you could give me

802
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
give me you could log me into that vms

803
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
box but i don't know dcl

804
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
i don't know what i'm doing with vms vax

805
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,559
some of y'all might be too young to

806
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
remember vms

807
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
uh

808
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,159
or uh

809
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,000
or something you know or some other

810
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
obscure operating system so the actors

811
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,799
when they got into the satellite they

812
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,240
they did not know what they were doing

813
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
so the good guys were able to take

814
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,279
control of their satellite back but the

815
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,520
hack happened twice

816
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
so my and one

817
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
one another presentation i'm working on

818
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
is to go into the details of how these

819
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,799
systems are built in the components and

820
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,679
there is a very large number of

821
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,440
operating systems

822
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,799
there's a large number of operating

823
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,679
systems and protocols and command

824
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,600
languages for these satellites so my

825
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,039
speculation is

826
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,799
is someone got got access probably

827
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,159
through the ground system and they got

828
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
in there they were able to export that

829
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
initial trust relationship and got into

830
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,279
the system

831
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
but once they got in there they were not

832
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,159
familiar with the command language and

833
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,520
the operating systems and they didn't

834
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
know what they had and how to operate in

835
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
that environment because it was just

836
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,799
something they were not familiar with

837
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
because there is a lot of different

838
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
command languages and os's

839
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,080
another one's this uh terra satellite it

840
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,880
got hit in uh 2000

841
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,120
in june 2008 and then again in october

842
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
2008

843
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,760
they believed it was the same actors

844
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,919
they they were able to get able to get

845
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,200
in somehow

846
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
but they were not able

847
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,080
to maintain access and really do any

848
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
damage because they didn't it did my

849
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
speculation

850
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
based on all the research i've done my

851
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
speculation is is they probably didn't

852
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
know the command language the syntax and

853
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,279
the os environment that they had gotten

854
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,960
into they got the access through

855
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,799
whatever trust relationship they were on

856
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,640
the ground system but they didn't know

857
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
what they were doing

858
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
now here's one

859
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,240
this is noah noah in the us is a

860
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
government agency that does weather in

861
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,440
the u.s and apparently in 2014 the

862
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,360
chinese it's attributed to the chinese

863
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,039
with this one

864
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,240
that they were

865
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
able to get control of that satellite we

866
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,679
were able to take back control of the

867
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,279
satellite but there for a while the

868
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,679
chinese apparently had taken control of

869
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,559
this

870
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,440
weather satellite

871
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
this was a really interesting one i

872
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,919
found

873
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,520
apparently

874
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
in the uk there's a there was a

875
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,159
satellite constellation called skynet

876
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,840
and sky network is composed of four

877
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
satellites

878
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
and uh and someone was able to gain

879
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
access back in 99 and took control of

880
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
one of the satellites and it speculated

881
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,440
that they helped they took control

882
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
and they held it for ransom

883
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
so that's pretty interesting there

884
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
wasn't ransomware but they held it for

885
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,559
ransom

886
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,760
i'm really it's going to be really

887
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,120
interesting

888
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
to see how long with all the thousands

889
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,240
and thousands of satellites that are

890
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
being put into orbit about how at what

891
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
point may we eventually see a ransomware

892
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,679
attack in space because i read i read

893
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,960
some statistics

894
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
here recently

895
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
that whenever spacex launches a rocket

896
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,080
that has 28 satellites

897
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
that there's roughly 4 000 linux

898
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,360
computers on that rocket when with 28

899
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
satellites that's a lot of linux now

900
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,919
they have really good really good

901
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,120
security

902
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,240
they know what they're doing and they're

903
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
very strict in their engineering

904
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,640
processes very disciplined but

905
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
but you know but uh

906
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
with all the cube sites that everyone's

907
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
throwing up and uh that are may not have

908
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
a real strict devops

909
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
def psych ops program it's going to be

910
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,840
interesting to see how long we might be

911
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,519
before we start hep c and

912
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,960
say ransomware of a satellite

913
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,200
the international space station it's

914
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
been infected a few times with

915
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
ransomware it's been it's

916
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
not not ransomware but malware

917
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
hasn't been no ransomware but just

918
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,240
malware

919
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,799
there was malware introduced through usb

920
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,399
thumb drive at one point and also

921
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,279
malware introduced to space station via

922
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,440
infected laptops that were brought on to

923
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,559
space station now the

924
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,080
the

925
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,640
the flight control system for space

926
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,039
station was not under threat

927
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,440
this was a different network

928
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,279
where they were plugged in and

929
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
the malware was

930
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,519
infected on the system

931
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,640
but

932
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
but it made it to space on the space

933
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
station

934
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,399
it was pretty interesting

935
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,080
uh

936
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
there's an organization called the

937
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,519
consultative committee for space data

938
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
systems

939
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,519
they come up with all the standards for

940
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,320
space systems satellite systems and the

941
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
best practices of how satellite systems

942
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
should be built and designed

943
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,840
and

944
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,960
it's just

945
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
including encryption but like i said not

946
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,320
you know you can write the documents but

947
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,760
you can't make somebody use it

948
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,519
this is you don't want to read this if

949
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,799
you want these slides i'll give them to

950
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,240
you with all these references but

951
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,480
there's a lot of there's a lot of work

952
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,600
going on

953
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,559
to document best practices for securing

954
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,480
the spacecraft securing the ground

955
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,080
systems

956
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,918
securing the end user terminals

957
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,200
nist

958
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
nist is doing a great deal of work they

959
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
just they recently published a draft

960
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,799
document nist 8270 for commercial space

961
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,600
they just released another document

962
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,279
8401

963
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
for ground system security

964
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
aerospace corporation is publishing a

965
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,279
great deal of work minor mit lincoln

966
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
labs

967
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,279
there was a as a result of the biosite

968
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,200
hack the cisa in the u.s they just

969
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,279
published some best practices

970
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
recommendations for securing

971
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
satellite networks and

972
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,720
including the user terminal stuff

973
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,880
and then the there's the federal comm

974
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,039
communications commission and

975
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,399
noaa

976
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
who monitors the weather they they have

977
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,000
their best practices they basically

978
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
point you to the cyber security then

979
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
this cyber security framework and

980
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
recommend using encryption and then

981
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
there's some others like the orbital

982
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
security alliance

983
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,760
they have some best practices for

984
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,639
commercial space systems to consider

985
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,679
using

986
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
there's a lot out there it's just it's

987
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,079
like everything somebody's got to read

988
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,839
it and actually put a program together

989
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,000
and implement it throughout the whole

990
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,599
design process

991
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,639
the whole life cycle

992
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
which leads into

993
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,239
as these new commercial space space

994
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
systems come online really need to get

995
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,199
defsat ops type processes involved and

996
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,119
start with the whole supply chain with

997
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,480
all the coding

998
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,399
and from the very beginning designing

999
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,560
these systems uh to be secure is like

1000
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,918
you know like a lot of it is moving to

1001
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:52,879
the cloud

1002
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,800
and then the cloud is moving into space

1003
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,040
itself to get this they get these uh

1004
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
systems locked down from the very

1005
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,440
beginning

1006
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,880
uh and use crypt encryption look at

1007
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,079
hardening the uh the systems

1008
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,079
for whatever is required at the uh the

1009
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,680
orbit that they're going to be and get

1010
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,640
them

1011
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
hardened for uh the radiation and the

1012
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
hostile space weather all the solar

1013
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,880
flares etc that are going on in space

1014
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,440
the plasma et cetera

1015
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,599
now something that's new

1016
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,800
is what

1017
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
is

1018
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
i've been reading a lot is satellites

1019
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,599
now are going to a software-defined

1020
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,680
model software-defined radio is going to

1021
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,359
be used which is going to help with

1022
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,400
jamming

1023
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,079
and electronic warfare because somebody

1024
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,440
starts hitting you on a frequency you

1025
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,640
can

1026
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,800
through software-defined radio you can

1027
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
change your frequencies change your

1028
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,920
radio frequency uh configuration quickly

1029
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
since it's in the software-defined radio

1030
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
but also which y'all might find

1031
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,520
interesting i found very interesting is

1032
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,599
it it's also moving to using virtual

1033
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,079
machines and containers in space

1034
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,000
and that makes it really interesting

1035
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
and which which uh which enables the new

1036
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
idea of what we're familiar with for

1037
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,680
many years in our enterprise and other

1038
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,839
organizations is being able to put an

1039
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,680
intrusion prevention system and put

1040
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
logging

1041
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
and maybe put some machine learning in

1042
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,280
ai so that we have we can able to we're

1043
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,079
able to baseline what is normal how do

1044
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,320
our engineers our technicians when they

1045
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
communicate with satellites what are the

1046
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
commands we expect them to send

1047
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,200
what order the command's coming in

1048
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,640
you know the timing et cetera it's

1049
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,680
probably going to be automated we're

1050
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,800
probably going to have pre-engineered

1051
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
and pre-scripted and what is going to be

1052
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,640
that timing that those commands are

1053
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,880
going to be set and what's expected and

1054
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
be able to apply uh machine learning

1055
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,320
ai to that and so we can quickly detect

1056
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,040
hey somebody somebody's figured out how

1057
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
to get access and they're sending

1058
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
commands out of order

1059
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,119
and maybe we need to maybe we need to go

1060
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,760
and boot up a different payload os or

1061
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
payload container to take over that's

1062
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,359
more hard and more trusted and more

1063
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,280
secure until we figure out what's

1064
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
happening because we obviously we got we

1065
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,200
may have somebody trying to help us

1066
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,720
manage our sites

1067
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
so so that is being tested i was reading

1068
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
aerospace corporation is about to launch

1069
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
a satellite to test some of these

1070
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,000
capabilities so that so that's good that

1071
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
they were headed there

1072
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,599
and like i said you know you've got to

1073
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
do the really strict

1074
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
configuration management of the system

1075
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,359
and know what version of the container

1076
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,680
or vm you're on and be able to restore

1077
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
back to a known good

1078
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,400
uh

1079
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
you know in case you have an issue then

1080
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
you need to get back to a point of a

1081
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,440
trusted trusted system so now we're

1082
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,200
going to containers and vms this is

1083
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
going to be a whole lot easier to do

1084
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,720
maybe we don't have to reboot the whole

1085
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
satellite computer system maybe we just

1086
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,599
we can just go and pull back go back to

1087
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,320
a trusted vm or contrusted container

1088
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,640
in the configuration management

1089
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,240
but

1090
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,280
that's

1091
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
what i had to share uh today

1092
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
uh

1093
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
i appreciate the b-sides uh cayman's

1094
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
team uh inviting me to come come back

1095
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,240
and uh

1096
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,920
to besides and and share with y'all i

1097
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,160
really enjoyed uh visiting the island

1098
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,440
again hope to come back again soon

1099
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
but y'all have any uh questions or

1100
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,480
anything

1101
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,720
yes sir

1102
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,560
he's gonna give you a microphone

1103
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,599
hi

1104
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,079
um you mentioned that they don't do any

1105
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,040
um

1106
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,839
encryption between ground

1107
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,599
stations and the satellites

1108
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,680
because of the interference from sun

1109
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,280
particles

1110
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
um

1111
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,359
but

1112
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,800
so so is that really because um

1113
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,560
of the limited bandwidth because of the

1114
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,520
interference and re-transmissions and i

1115
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,760
would assume they would use some type of

1116
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,200
um

1117
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
frequency hop-in

1118
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
to to do the transmissions so is that

1119
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,240
sufficient to keep the bandwidth up

1120
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,200
uh to allow encryption and aside from

1121
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,240
that

1122
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,640
is there any kind of um

1123
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
hashing that is done

1124
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,400
between the ground station and the

1125
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,079
satellite to ensure the integrity of

1126
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,520
data

1127
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,800
well

1128
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,520
the the encryption is not that's used on

1129
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,079
the satellites everything i've read it

1130
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,640
is uh i've been reading here very

1131
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,839
recently

1132
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,079
it's on the fcc

1133
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,400
website yeah

1134
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,960
they uh they've decided

1135
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,720
that they're not going to force an

1136
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
encryption standard on the commercial

1137
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
satellite industry so

1138
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,200
however they choose to do the key

1139
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,920
exchange the hashing etc that's all up

1140
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,119
to the individual satellite companies

1141
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,640
it's not a fourth standard like

1142
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,440
everybody's going to use aes 512 what

1143
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
have you so

1144
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,240
i have no need to know i don't work for

1145
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,839
the organizations and if i did i would

1146
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,760
be under ndas where i couldn't disclose

1147
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
it right so

1148
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
i just all i can do is just like

1149
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,599
yourself go out and do a lot of googling

1150
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,119
and read what's been published in the

1151
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,079
open source right and uh

1152
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,119
do my own

1153
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,760
reductive reasoning well this is seems

1154
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,400
to be what happened but on the uh

1155
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,880
i like i like your idea about the uh

1156
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,560
changing the spectrum and i think that

1157
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
you can do some really creative things

1158
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,160
with software-defined radio and i think

1159
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
uh i don't know for i don't know

1160
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,640
personally but like in the case of what

1161
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,400
we're seeing in ukraine where the

1162
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,319
russians started interfering with

1163
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,760
starlink

1164
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,800
and then spacex sent a code update

1165
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
and fixed it and now they don't have a

1166
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,040
problem so i think you can with

1167
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
software-defined radios

1168
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
you can start changing frequencies and

1169
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,839
you can work around issues but

1170
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,520
encryption

1171
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
it's just you know it's just that it

1172
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
depends on what the vendors want to

1173
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,240
whoever you know owns the sas what they

1174
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,599
implement and

1175
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,520
okay you know cool

1176
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,960
it's interesting it's a interesting

1177
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280
domain to study yeah

1178
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,319
yeah

1179
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,599
um

1180
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,319
but

1181
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,920
that was that was the idea the idea is

1182
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,520
that is it that they don't do the

1183
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
encryption or they stay away from it

1184
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,079
because of the bandwidth limitations

1185
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,040
i don't know if it's a bandwidth

1186
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,280
i've read i've read where one individual

1187
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
talked about about it being a bandwidth

1188
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,079
concern but everything that i've read

1189
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,520
it's more to do with the space weather

1190
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,839
because it's from the space weather

1191
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,359
the solar flares

1192
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,880
all the the protons neutrons the ions

1193
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
ionization it's going flowing through

1194
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,200
space like solar flare right and

1195
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
that is the biggest issue of disrupting

1196
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,000
uh doing the single event upsets and

1197
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,079
flipping bits right and because of that

1198
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,839
because of that they would have a lot of

1199
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,520
retransmissions because of the

1200
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
interference right so that would then

1201
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,200
affect the overall bandwidth yeah that

1202
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
could yeah yeah so that's what yeah

1203
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
they'd have to be

1204
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,560
re-exchanging keys getting things reset

1205
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,160
and the connection would be up and down

1206
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,640
they would lose control of the satellite

1207
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
uh being able to manage it because of

1208
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,200
all the key constant key exchanges

1209
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,040
maybe you get one command

1210
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,319
but you didn't get the second or third

1211
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,319
command were you at in your command

1212
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,000
sequence right because of all the

1213
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,359
exchanges yeah

1214
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,040
it could be disruptive but that's where

1215
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,319
you had to start using uh hardened

1216
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,400
hardened communications gear that's

1217
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,040
that's uh designed to survive space

1218
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,200
okay but but that drives up the cost

1219
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,560
yeah and if you're you know if you're a

1220
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
university and a researcher on a real

1221
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,640
cheap uh budget

1222
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,480
you don't have a lot of budget for

1223
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,000
you know you're using raspberry pies and

1224
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,200
bagel bones you got to do the best you

1225
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,079
can do

1226
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,079
right you just want to accept the risk

1227
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,200
that somebody's going to be able to

1228
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,720
listen to your traffic

1229
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,599
right

1230
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,640
okay thanks

1231
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,880
which is really interesting uh if you're

1232
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
not aware a lot of the computers uh

1233
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
raspberry pi's and beaglebones are uh

1234
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,480
used

1235
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,839
for like a lot of these cubesats

1236
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,160
any more questions

1237
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,880
good purposes yeah it is yeah it's all

1238
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,640
good i mean uh it's great it's just you

1239
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,920
know everybody's wanting to get into

1240
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,680
commercial space and i want and i'm

1241
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,119
interested it's like okay where does the

1242
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,440
baseline what has actually happened with

1243
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,480
space

1244
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,000
over the years and is everyone starts

1245
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,880
all these new startups it's like silicon

1246
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,480
valley you know the whole internet

1247
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,839
crazed back

1248
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,400
in the late 90s early 2000s everybody's

1249
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,880
running into space now

1250
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
we need to go and secure these systems

1251
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,000
like we needed to go and secure the

1252
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,040
internet

1253
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,359
and harden web servers and databases

1254
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,480
back

1255
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,119
you know we need to do it with space too

1256
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,280
what what would be the

1257
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,440
the commercial value

1258
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,200
to the small guy

1259
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
here i mean it's one thing to have

1260
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
infrastructure in space

1261
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,800
that's probably communicating quickly

1262
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,640
with satellites and doing storage

1263
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,319
compute type things

1264
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,680
but what's

1265
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,119
what's the guy in the cayman islands

1266
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
going to use it for let's say

1267
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,839
well your uh your

1268
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
the the weather

1269
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
they uh say if there's computing in

1270
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,480
space one of the reasons they're going

1271
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,560
one of the primary applications for

1272
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,359
putting computing resources in space

1273
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,160
is a there's weather weather satellites

1274
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,800
that could be collecting imagery in

1275
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,040
space or be looking at certain parts of

1276
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,480
the island watching for erosion

1277
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,079
et cetera and

1278
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
be able to pre-process the imagery

1279
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
and instead of sending everything that

1280
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,119
is collected down

1281
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,119
and using all the bandwidth to send just

1282
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,160
everything

1283
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,839
and overworking analysts that are

1284
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,560
already very busy

1285
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,280
the

1286
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,119
if you if you have the storage in space

1287
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,960
if you have the computing power

1288
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,200
then the computer in space can

1289
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,079
pre-process apply analytics but you know

1290
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,480
play the ai do all the image analysis

1291
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,079
get all that automated

1292
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,400
so that the imagery is pre-processed and

1293
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,359
only what you need is sent down

1294
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,079
uh so you know so you're uh

1295
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,800
so your military your uh

1296
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,119
whoever your environmental whoever is

1297
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,960
watching the environment and protecting

1298
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,920
the environment the national parks

1299
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,040
et cetera

1300
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,119
can be getting only the imaging that

1301
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,200
they really need the best imaging where

1302
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,119
they can focus instead of having to look

1303
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,440
at you know terabytes of data and

1304
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,119
keeping their bandwidth and running up

1305
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,440
their cost they can just use what they

1306
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
need

1307
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
and so there's a lot of applications

1308
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,760
though that are going to come about

1309
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,280
as a result of that storage being in

1310
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,040
space and only going to be limited by

1311
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
the creativity

1312
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,560
but the image analysis is what comes to

1313
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,640
my mind first uh that's the easy one

1314
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,440
any more questions

1315
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,640
uh i'll i will tell you i don't i don't

1316
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
have a slide for it but if you hit if

1317
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,880
you hit me on linkedin if you want the

1318
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,119
slides i'll send you the slides uh or

1319
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,480
twitter i'll send you the slides if you

1320
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,000
like them share i'll give them to the

1321
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,760
conference

1322
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,000
but if you're interested in playing with

1323
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,920
uh satellite software

1324
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
you can mock up especially like you know

1325
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
if you have children that are interested

1326
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,800
in space and and learning about the

1327
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,280
systems there is a lot of capabilities

1328
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,680
available in the open source community

1329
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,560
and all you need is the power of a

1330
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,720
raspberry pi or a beagle bone you don't

1331
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,160
have to have a high-end computer run

1332
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
this there's a

1333
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
open sat kit

1334
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,480
open s-a-t kit

1335
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
from nasa freaking nasa

1336
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,480
it's going to work

1337
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,200
it works good in the inside of nasa

1338
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,240
instead of the open in the openstack kit

1339
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,480
they have cfs

1340
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,800
core flight software which is cubesat

1341
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,560
software that actually flies

1342
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,960
and then it includes ball aerospaces

1343
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,520
cosmos which is a ground system software

1344
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,960
and then they have another tool that
