<font color="#E5E5E5">talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what i thought was the</font>

43
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,080
infosec<font color="#CCCCCC"> armors so was the idea that</font>

44
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,080
things were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spiraling out of</font>

45
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,628
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the last 12 months have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a kind of calm but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often in this room</font>

62
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,750
in listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone i meet our and</font>

63

66
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,190
assuming that things are the way they

67
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,219
are you either go really a positive and

68
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,810

69
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,080
negative quite everything is tonight

70
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,310
high grade there's no good answers and

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:03,240
spirulina so where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what should</font>

72
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:06,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a beauty story is a group thing or</font>

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,490
Twitter you understand but there is a

75
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,859
high mind out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

76
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:20,100
start to look at that headline by the

77
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:25,800
way black and blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of wonder</font>

78
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:27,990
what happens doing that hammering so one

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,750
of the things I've realized in micro

80
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,200
beer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we seem to have this</font>

81
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,970
concept of a resume generating event

82
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:41,180
anybody ever heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that term right</font>

83

really generating event<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah what why</font>

84
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,110
right why would that be a resume resume

85
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:52,229
generator<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was believed in you know</font>

86
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:54,650
over the past year or so and so few

87
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:58,770
things that I want to talk about what is

88
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:05,070
can we fail are we allowed to as a

89
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:08,609
community fail and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for everyone</font>

90
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,370
she decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a nurse</font>

91
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,580

92
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:21,820
care for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years so anybody know</font>

93
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:24,609
who this is funny Alexander Fleming is

94

famous for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor while identifying is</font>

95
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,820
famous for invention penicillin and the

96
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:35,520
way he invented penicillin was to

97
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,520
failure actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Archie had a</font>

98
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,620
contained and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

99
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:48,240
clean and<font color="#CCCCCC"> free of bacteria and he had a</font>

100
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,240
failure in his own lab protocol and so

101
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,790
there are two year for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bacteria boom</font>

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,880
penicillin was discovered what actually

103
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his peers thought it was that</font>

104
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,530
crazy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he is because they</font>

105
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,900
couldn't replicate his conditions and

106
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,939
the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I rotate them because they</font>

107
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,360
were working in a clean room he is

108
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,240
actually replicating it was he had a

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,110
breach or failure in his lab and

110
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduced force</font>

111
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:30,549
was invented so failure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go so</font>

112
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,170
deep into happening i<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

113
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:38,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">airlines and airplanes and and different</font>

114
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,420
failure scenarios you can't help but

115
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,829
wonder if<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

116
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:51,649
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some of these things</font>

117
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:53,839
including um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so perfect it down</font>

kind of gas it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> close everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

120
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:07,730
Twitter doesn't happened um anomaly

122
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:15,259
time did your blimp it's fun but not our

123
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,110
normal mode so last year all saying you

124
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,079
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this we've got this</font>

125
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,149
situation where we are in a panic and

126
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,488
everyone's an answer now but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

127
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,230
super blood answer right now because we

128
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:30,259
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the security problem</font>

129
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:37,189
immediately hackers are bidding<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

130
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:40,399
ball and so really it's because the

131
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:42,799
marketplace that you're in of generating

132
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,129
going to use just the way you work as a

133
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,809
society the world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unforgiving and so</font>

134
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:50,470
the security guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be perfect to</font>

135
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,469
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an imperfect</font>

136
00:10:52,460 --> 00:11:03,780
especially not publicly so here's what

137
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:05,430
we should be asking that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we</font>

138
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,770
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can fail</font>

139
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,449
well one of the consequences of me

140
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:19,800
failing should actually does this seem

141
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:21,150
to a anybody hear her DevOps cafe oh so

142

167
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,710
because that is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using something</font>

168
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,590
in this conversation we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing a lot</font>

169
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:53,970
of information so what happens in a lot

170
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:57,780
of places is you did no one ever and you

171
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">need you have to take the personnel and</font>

173
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,100
my name is still incendiary

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you get</font>

177
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:27,509
into these weird areas work who's doing

178
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:31,660
weapon nobody's doing anything right yes

179
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:34,959
this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> house a grateful is as soon</font>

180
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,879
as try and signal down the failure or

181
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,099
whatever it is where the field was Miss

182
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,369
keeper two of the six of a few

183
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,619
individuals in the system within

184
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:47,289
ourselves learning we don't know why

185
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:50,559
that person did it because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the</font>

186
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:53,439
most for area or the evil thing you can

187
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,660
which is I understand only did<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

188
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:58,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you're under then they will see the</font>

189
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:04,660
consequences of their persons actions

190
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:08,248
right so that's a problem and so we

191
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that we are actually in control</font>

192
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:16,679
we're going with complexity on total

193
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:16,679
complexity where people

194
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:25,410
and that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true so we start working</font>

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,610
in the environment right nobody does

196
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:35,490
anything right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do</font>

197
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything do we it carefully so</font>

198
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:44,319
making any changes changes a bad evil

199
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,540
and I mr. falling behind in the market

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> early years older went to a place</font>

201
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:53,290
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still had systems operating</font>

202
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,080
systems and stuff from the landings as

203
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,750
they're ubiquitous really apart from the

204
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,130
desktops and you wonder why don't you

205
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:07,900
stop what we can do and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

206
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:16,330
these guys gonna be busy cuz you busy

207
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:21,010
stuff Billy change there was a river ok

208
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,579
so what fun is amorous book services or

209
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:27,170
just responses

210
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:28,459
here are almost never almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> never the</font>

result of guy perform a trick

212
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:34,969
performance reviews immediately why do

213
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,649
you get monthly package that's not right

214
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,489
all right all the network went down

215
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:44,179
immediate for me that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should be</font>

216
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:47,389
awkward and so there is a result of just

217
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:52,100
improper relationships remain in a

218

of all directions<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived</font>

232
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,529
and because of that because these

233
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,529
destructive anybody we're going to

234
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:53,689
creative destruction and what does that

235
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean create a disruption that means</font>

236
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:58,488
people are gonna come in and take over

237
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:03,439
the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can have it and</font>

238
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:06,049
so that's the just what we face and so

239
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:10,509
what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back first lesson</font>

240
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:16,309
that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go home today is finger</font>

241
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:20,419
in a sense is a good thing as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

242
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:23,240
you take away something you have to feed

243
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:26,240
back you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is an engineering</font>

244
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,090
science in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways but it's not a</font>

245
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,919
known quantity so you have to take

246
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,699
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> back with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you there first and</font>

247
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:39,639
why do you say so the number one thing

248
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,639
is failure in a sense is a good thing

249
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:52,620
well because we can't fail because we

250
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:56,070
have to be perfect in a young science

251
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:06,168
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to be certain</font>

remember that lead into this world when

290
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,309

just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so banking regulation</font>

294
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:59,690
to me anything you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like history history</font>

295
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:03,350
history so i can see it's having our way

296
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:08,150
of saying bankruptcy so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

297
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:11,179
history of<font color="#CCCCCC"> man 30 well Monty desks Monty</font>

signify that they were out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business</font>

305
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:35,060
it would simplify this by literally

306
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,390
breaking layer batches to mention a

307
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,659

574
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not that easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just say boom it's</font>

576
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,430
effort but I think it's somewhere we

577
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:36,619
need to go so i thought i would propose

578
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:39,919
it the concept would be simple body it

579
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:44,780
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a profit motive look at</font>

00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,260
funded so that you do have a proper

583
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,670
order yeah but they should be also

584
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,830
biased because the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

585

596
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,970
there needs to be a way to figure out if

646
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,089
packaging so the manuals weren't the

647
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:45,009
right way if the actual machines were

648

<font color="#E5E5E5">not the right way then the quality of</font>

650
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:52,440
the entire product was subject to

651
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:57,519
question and he really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in a</font>

something they're based on a fatty part

654
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:04,359
is hella hard at work you want to

<font color="#E5E5E5">relegate there so everything was</font>

656
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:09,519
measured everything was passed down

657
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,950
everything was presents so you had the

658
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:15,098
ultimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> condition and they didn't have</font>

659
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:18,799
it religious<font color="#E5E5E5"> chants</font>

660
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:21,499
there will be in effect the chemical

661
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:26,239
makeup of the tour so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you're</font>

662
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:32,930
passing oh by the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> head on a</font>

665
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:46,579
feudal system<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kill hutch</font>

668
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:58,308
so you got they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a Malaysian</font>

669
00:42:56,959 --> 00:43:01,219
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're actually looking at rights</font>

670
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:04,489
and but people cut out for white people

671
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:06,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">too so sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you wanna get good</font>

672
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:14,959
you want to measure and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

673
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:17,988
what's happening so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't finches</font>

674
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:21,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">her people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> horrible bad but we're</font>

675
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:22,819
not learning how they do it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

676
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,650
it and so they keep happening over and

677
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:29,420
over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

678
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,760
yeah that's bad we saw his entry it's

679
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,410
not reviewable

680
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,050
because we don't know how to measure

681
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,319
because it's the kimono are you going to

682
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:44,190
keep close we can talk about your boots

683
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:51,720
our friends over here and nobody knows

684
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:55,540
so we have another interesting issue it

685
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:59,109
lesson which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we incentivize</font>

686
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:02,170
people all right wheel centralize them

687
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,630
by robots<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your participate in</font>

688
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,140
a book bank in no pods no bugs but

689
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:11,500
you're bad no to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and so I</font>

690
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this in the 90s and I was like</font>

691
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,820
wow we've been fighting this this is a

692
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,439
comic from the 90's I was a cure we've

693
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,180
been playing this problem for a long

694
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,810
time we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to write ourselves</font>

695
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:25,509
a bunch of minivans and what we doing

696
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:28,270
hey write a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs solve the</font>

697
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,630
problem no software flaws right so I'm

698
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:32,890
just moving for this track to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

699
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is green pill bugs are</font>

700
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,330
bugs are bugs here we're all still

701
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:43,390
getting hacked in hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so this</font>

702
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:46,480
is obviously work we don't know so maybe

703
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:50,830
what we should do is licensed under miss

704
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,990
your license ball that's got yet if his

705
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:55,869
license and everybody knows how to do

706
00:44:52,990 --> 00:45:00,129
this they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font>

707
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:02,019
two times not turns out that licensing

708
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,119
is a challenge for a number of reasons

709
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:06,819

<font color="#CCCCCC">bloggers and you entered on with icons</font>

737
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,700
so there's a disconnect right so now

738
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,390
everything in our field can be just

auditors started out as accounting folks

775
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,190
because the original IT systems where

776
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:56,230
accounting systems so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that</font>

00:48:54,190 --> 00:49:00,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tibor how did your CEO of your</font>

you go off and listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talk</font>

780
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:11,650
about Liverpool I have story about a

781
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:18,310
profession so I started off like ours

782
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:21,790
that potentially is there for example

783
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,279
deliver to nurse but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

784
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:26,170
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> meanwhile bear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen is that</font>

785
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">long time ago we had a storage of people</font>

786
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:33,940
doctors immediately more<font color="#E5E5E5"> care something</font>

787
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:35,500
and so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just</font>

788
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,109
take people off the street you show them

789
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,109
how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume somebody and people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

dying in their rooms infection instead

791
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:47,680
of the initial reason that you're there

792
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:50,319
for seven Gail created a methodology or

793
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,500
an actual structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our treat people</font>

794
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,210
right ready yeah it's crazy if you wash

795
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,760
your hands or if you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch the tool</font>

796
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you use depends on the player</font>

797
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,890
bacteria doesn't happen so crazy story

798
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,200
anyway so this person

799
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:07,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">some end product of years different</font>

800
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,828
nurses became researchers became

801
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:14,890
philosophers became people of thinking

802
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:21,910
status and so you listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their work</font>

803
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:26,109
and you read their work so kids are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>
