just we have that is like we had a

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,910
better building like

people

14
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,709
stop

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,770
is this work

17
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,970
hey

18
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,780
afternoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody welcome to app sec</font>

19
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,310
beyond compliance aight i let subtitle

20
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,950
that your guide to not so good

21
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance you'll see why when i get to</font>

22
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,609
it later slide we're quickly show of

23
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,060
hands who here is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font>

24
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,730
security audit before PCI HIPAA oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

25
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,350
actually substantial<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay raise</font>

26
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,970
your hands higher if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like auditing</font>

27
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,319
and you think compliance actually make

28
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,140
security better yeah I didn't think so

29
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,208
mmm so we're going to talk about why

30
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,350
compliant sucks we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna talk a</font>

31
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,970
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ol boss top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

32
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's everyone's go-to</font>

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,590
checklist for is my web owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl and</font>

34
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,730
it doesn't get enough job there we're

35
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough security</font>

36
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,140
and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means and what it means</font>

37
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,380
for business people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what it means</font>

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,200
for security engineers not really the

39
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention a I'm</font>

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,979
gonna introduce a taxonomy of

41
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,200
vulnerability um that will make sense

42
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably in a later slide how to build</font>

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,250
secure and maintainable applications and

44
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,330
how to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers from their own</font>

45
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,010
bad habits so if you're um if you've

46
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,390
done compliance auditing this problem

47
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be new to you but there are</font>

48
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,570
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of audits depending on</font>

49
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,130
the industry you're working in

50
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,740
e-commerce if you're done with credit

51
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,979
card numbers you have PCI payment card

52
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,090
industry data security standards

53
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,229
sarbanes-oxley if you're do anything

54
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,359
with a corporation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly</font>

55
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,150
traded this is popular in financial

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,380
institutions HIPAA dealing with

57
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,359
financial information this is what I'm

58
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,880
currently dealing with it um my previous

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,550
employer and phipps for non-military

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,590
government sometimes you might run into

61
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of them sometimes you might run into</font>

62
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">none of them and you're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,090
company that doesn't really care about

64
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,520
security so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had like an online</font>

65
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">traded or publicly traded corporation</font>

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,200
that published an online app for

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,780
veterans you'd probably have to comply

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,820
with all four which as of last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,289
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a PCI audit was not really</font>

70
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,510
possible because the requirements for

71
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:28,760
SSL for phipps and the requirements for

72
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,099
PCI contradicted each other so have fun

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,810
alright so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why</font>

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,820
compliance sucks is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time consuming</font>

75
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,440
you have to take time<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from building</font>

76
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,469
stuff that creates obvious value to your

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,719
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> um which in turn raises costs</font>

78
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,320
it's also invisible unless you're

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,240
actively being attacked like NSA KGB or

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,810
even you know underground groups

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,430
anonymous hack the planet you're not

82
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,320
probably going to see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of return on</font>

83
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,460
investment it's insufficient if you're

84
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,780
doing compliance usually you're

85
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,859
following a checklist and if you need

86
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,630
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the checklist do you think</font>

87
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i'm done i stopped here into the</font>

88
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,920
line when attackers are actually far

89
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,840
more creative than that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're also</font>

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,670
responsible for a lot of complacency and

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,099
negligence a lot of business owners

92
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,970
assume okay well I'm PCI compliance I

93
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep up to date on</font>

94
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,780
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're compliant and</font>

95
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,670
unfortunately that's a fallacy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

96
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,429
ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up costing consumers more than</font>

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,250
anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'd like to propose the</font>

98
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,700
compliance of in diagram and it kind of

99
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,700
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

100
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,960
so in theory the way security compliance

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,550
supposed to work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have school</font>

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,270
security practitioners who regularly

103
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,009
test your network for risks um on except

104
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,378
the ones reported fixed addressed and

105
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintained you know it in it</font>

106
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,319
everything's you know maintained

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,179
reasonably quickly and responsibly and

108
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,159
this will keep your company security

109
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,449
robust and you won't have anything

110
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,210
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what happened with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony or</font>

111
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">with push last week and everything will</font>

112
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,219
be great unfortunately in practice since

113
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,780
the company's dictate what the scope is

114
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:04,530
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically select things they know</font>

115
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,840
are hard targets then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are another</font>

116
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is you have auditors who just</font>

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,049
literally fire up automated tools

118
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your application go oh we</font>

119
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,310
didn't find anything that's as far as

120
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,840
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Delft McAfee did that for</font>

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,449
one of the applications I built while I

122
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,280
was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> at UCF some of them will</font>

123
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,680
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have people actually test your</font>

124
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,888
application manually these are one of

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,689
the more legitimate companies on

126
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:31,169
completion<font color="#CCCCCC"> and checklist is completed</font>

127
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're certified yay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

128
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,789
they check for the things on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

129
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten list you know injection both sequel</font>

130
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ldap cross-site scripting etc etc if</font>

131
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,219
you're familiar with owasp none of this

132
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,659
is new<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you they haven't published</font>

133
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:45,330
another list of top<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten but it probably</font>

134
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:48,779
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be too different so as I said</font>

135
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,400
before compliance sucks but

136
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-compliance is so much worse than</font>

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,878
compliance

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,050
let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> olas top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

139
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,930
lists if you notice something

140
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,699
interesting about it is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

141
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,580
vulnerability was the number one for

both 2010 and 2013<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years of</font>

research three years of security

create a sequel injection this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

146
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,188
non-compliance means you don't comply

with the bare minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

you say I will not invest this much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

163
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,899
what happens so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good good enough</font>

164
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,939
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately to be sympathetic</font>

165
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:13,720
towards the Sony guy there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tough</font>

166
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,490
cost-benefit trade-off you have to make

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,470
you can't sit there and hire two

168
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,540
thousand auditors and engineers to

169
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,490
rebuild every little micro application

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,910
if you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a two page app</font>

171
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,990
on WordPress or a simple Android app you

172
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't need that much investment</font>

173
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,389
but what I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think his arguments</font>

174
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,940
captured is that not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars and</font>

175
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:35,769
hours are spent the same you can waste

178
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,439
these auditors who will literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

179
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,699
rubber-stamp anything you put in front

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,980
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they get paid for you</font>

181
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:49,990
know X amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money for approving a</font>

182
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:53,290
checklist so<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so exploitation takes</font>

183
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,939
place at the application layer um system

184
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">all vulnerability still do exist and</font>

185
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:59,110
they still do matter but most of what

186
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:01,750
you see that actually gets into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,730
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be um like sequel</font>

188
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,319
injection oh we hired<font color="#E5E5E5"> an auditing</font>

189
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,189
company or we hired a development

190
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:08,649
company that didn't know if they were

191

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody got lfi access into our</font>

192
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,579
system they dumped our hashes and they

193
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,069
figured out a root password that's

194
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:17,079
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common way things go</font>

195
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:21,099
or the simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> route they literally</font>

196
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,660
sequel I into a reverse shell so if you

197
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,860
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make your company more secure if</font>

198
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,750
you want to make the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure</font>

199
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,019
it makes sense to focus on developing

200
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,790
more secure software so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

201
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,259
that it's easier said than done a lot of

202
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on Twitter a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of specially</font>

203
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,949
cryptographers will tell you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

204
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:37,329
try it's a lost cause I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

205
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,069
agree with that philosophy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

206
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,930
there's three things we can do simple

207
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,149
strategies that will make software

208
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,489
better and more secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general across</font>

209
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,870
the board so first things first we need

210
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide developers with a secure</font>

211
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,029
environment

212
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,770
if you have a compromised system and you

213
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,120
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build safe software the people</font>

214
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,260
who compromise your system are going to

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,750
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it say whatever they</font>

216
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,160
want and unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're diligent and</font>

217
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,810
paranoid you probably won't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

218
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,949
and you'll just commit the changes in

219
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">your next you know push to get teach</font>

220
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,270
developers about security this is what a

221
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,589
lost focus is on um this is actually one

222
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,050
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most effective strategies for</font>

223
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,110
securing everything because people who

224
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,029
know something can share it with others

225
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,440
education is actually the one security

226
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,510
strategy that has the highest ROI

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,610
because when you train somebody when you

228
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,930
teach somebody they can go on and pass

229
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,640
it on to somebody else who doesn't know

230
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you actually make less people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

231
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,380
crappy code and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing you</font>

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,630
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is provide tools that are secured</font>

233
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">by default so I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody is</font>

234
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,620
familiar with me me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or any of my</font>

235
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,750
research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do as a hobby I go</font>

236
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,430
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> on github and I'll you know</font>

237
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,620
bitbucket and I find application

238
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,729
frameworks and published vulnerabilities

239
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,920
in them slim cake PHP codeigniter really

240
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,570
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them have been safe so far</font>

241
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Symphony had a really weird one but it</font>

242
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,230
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge case so I don't to call</font>

243
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,430
that a vulnerability if you want you can

244
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,600
come talk to me after the talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

245
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:02,579
probably talk your ear off about it for

246
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,900
hours so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's focus on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font>

247
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,750
approach teaching developers about

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,420
security as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> at leads to better at</font>

249
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,830
option of better security practices if

250
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,140
your employer and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> considering</font>

251
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,480
hiring a developer or training an

252
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,920
existing developer in security would you

253
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,410
rather train somebody who leaves and

254
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,060
goes on to your competitors or would you

255
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather have somebody remain ignorant and</font>

256
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,010
remain with your company the more

257
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,720
developers no security the more hands

258
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">our debt are on deck to find a fix bugs</font>

259
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,370
I mean that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of obvious there's a</font>

260
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,650
famous quote that everyone likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

fun of with enough eyeballs all bugs are

262
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,430
shallow and then you have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

263
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl bug last year heartbleed or</font>

264
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,900
any other subsequent ones apparently

265
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,050
there aren't enough eyeballs on open

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,310
source projects so challenges to

267
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,469
teaching people security is that this

268
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,479
curriculum expands every year new

269
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,329
vulnerabilities are published and it's

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,040
just a complicated topic

271
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,888
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the old vulnerabilities</font>

272
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,799
re-emerge new year you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in new areas</font>

273
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:03,619
a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine is actually publishing</font>

274
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,299
a paper and doing a talk in August about

275
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,399
what's called a flush and reload attack

276
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:09,499
it's basically a timing attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

277
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,899
l3 cache on your processor and you can

00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:13,939
use this to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> side channel</font>

279
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,279
cryptographic applications well he<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

280
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,049
out you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this to also</font>

unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a limited pool of</font>

this whole situation where the people

00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:46,399
it got drives costs up and it reduces

294
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,529
the amount of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shared</font>

295
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,769
this is what the old hacker underground

296
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:54,339
feared from the security movement so

297
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,569
let's talk about complexity let's

298
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain securities complex we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

299
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,559
of abstract a lot of the details out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

300
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,019
it um yeah there's different kinds of

301
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,579
attacks and vulnerabilities but let's

302
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,249
focus on the broad category is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

303
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,219
little granular details so we're going

304
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:11,809
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Kingdom not really</font>

305
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,049
species so kingdom would be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

306
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:19,339
know animal or I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> animal</font>

307
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:21,049
vegetable mineral whatever so I've taken

308
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,730
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the vulnerabilities you'll find</font>

309
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,889
in actual real-world applications and

310
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,629
split them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up into three categories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

311
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is a nice model for teaching</font>

312
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,999
people how to approach security who have

313
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:34,249
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it for the first time so the</font>

314
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:36,589
first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> application logic you know</font>

315
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,480
what is your appt doing the segment one

316
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,309
is the one that most people focus on is

317
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> separation between data and</font>

318
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:44,160
instructions and the third one is your

319
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,079
operating environment

320
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,129
okay these are application

321
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,829
vulnerabilities there's obviously

322
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network ones there's physical ones and</font>

323
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:53,878
operation environment kind of touches on

324
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,370
all of those but let's talk about

325
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,550
application logic I don't know how well

326
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I feel pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear so</font>

327
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,060
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an all comic about people who</font>

328
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,220
try to use like venom miracle occurs in

329
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,699
scientific papers this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

330
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,870
people do in their online applications

331
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,128
for example a shopping cart where you

332
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,970
can skip the payment process and go

333
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly to entering your shipping</font>

334
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,990
information that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

335
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,370
vulnerability unless you actually take

336
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,540
the time to look for that you probably

337
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,480
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking through the</font>

338
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:25,079
code for can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> inject a comma here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

339
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">or ' here and get code execution there</font>

340
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,128
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for humans to find surprisingly</font>

341
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,329
it's a little bit harder for automated

342
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:34,019
scanners because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just looking</font>

343
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:35,550
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns and code the impact varies</font>

344
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bias horse alone in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

345
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,699
spectrum if somebody goes on your

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">shopping cart and manages to order a</font>

347
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,139
hundred dollars worth of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

348
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,339
fancy slippers and you go hey wait a

349
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,810
minute I never receive payment for that

350
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,129
you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancel the order your</font>

351
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">application was vulnerable but you can</font>

352
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably mitigate it very easily and</font>

353
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:53,360
careful planning can avoid most of the

354
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:57,959
problems without with application logic

355
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,589
so I mean I forgot to break that slide

356
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,729
up so data is instruction this is kind

357
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing you run into when you're</font>

358
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,899
doing security research the most buffer

359
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,100
overflows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see programs for mashing</font>

360
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,740
vulnerabilities those are two of the

361
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,170
most famous ones um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in web world we</font>

362
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,170
have sequel injection on cross-site

363
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:20,310
scripting and the goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually to</font>

364
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:24,050
take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm so how</font>

365
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:26,540
do you stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so</font>

366
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,269
we go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crook so a sequel injection</font>

367
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,209
what you do is you send a parameter to a

368
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,339
query and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way you write</font>

369
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,839
your data it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

370
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,580
instructions following that bit of

371
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,160
information so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually manage to</font>

372
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:44,209
say um like in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bobby tables example</font>

373
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,829
like 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 40 slides ago Bobby drop</font>

374
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:49,310
table students<font color="#E5E5E5"> it deleted the students</font>

375
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:51,380
table most vulnerabilities that result

376
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,268
in exploitation our form of data and

377
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,500
instruction confusion I believe that's

378
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:57,920
one of the fundamentals problems of

379
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,050
security so if you're using buffers you

380
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,849
know use functions safely distrust input

381
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,380
don't do like heartbleed and say I'm

382
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give you 65 kilobytes of data</font>

383
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,619
if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if you're asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for one</font>

384
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,879
operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems mitigate this with</font>

385
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:13,909
different attacks or different

386
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,880
techniques you know writer<font color="#CCCCCC"> right or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

cetera<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mastering vulnerabilities are</font>

389
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:23,420
almost extinct but just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them</font>

390
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,240
badly don't printf user variable that

391
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,280
that's bad with sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this has</font>

392
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,530
actually been a recurring question on

393
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,230
Stack Overflow used for amortized

394
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,090
queries prepared statements you know

395
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,980
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> your parameters whatever you want</font>

396
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,928
to call it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate them in cinnamon</font>

397
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,360
separate packets it's you're not going

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,770
to jump out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it unless you're using an</font>

400
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,940
prepared statements and doesn't actually

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,179
send a packet separately cross-site

402
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,770
scripting honestly it there aren't any

403
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,510
really good solutions if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your template</font>

404
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,190
engine escapes your parameters for you

405
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably use that if you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a manual</font>

407
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,020
escaping process you know make sure you

408
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,780
keep character encoding in mind that can

409
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bite you if your PHP developer</font>

410
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,280
twig is wonderful they now auto escape

411
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,620
by default unless you tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

412
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,649
so operating environment this covers a

413
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,750
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ground um a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and</font>

414
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,720
every detail matters and unfortunately

415
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,610
there's it's so wide and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that</font>

416
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,750
deep and<font color="#CCCCCC"> related application security is</font>

417
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,290
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into into too much</font>

418
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,290
detail um

419
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:32,640
you know is who hosts it who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

420
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it are you up to date is it well</font>

421
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,160
designed you know permissions issues how

422
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,649
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connecting all these issues or</font>

423
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,660
operating environment issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> um if you</font>

424
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">use third-party components that's also</font>

425
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,970
an operating environment issue because

426
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,409
you didn't write that code someone else

427
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,220
did and since you're depending on that

428
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,050
that's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your environment so let's</font>

429
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,920
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at how developers acquire</font>

430
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party libraries so when I went</font>

431
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,250
back here let's go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font>

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,620
secured by default are kind of the same

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,060
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a specific way so lists mmm</font>

437
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">best way to illustrate this is through</font>

438
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,250
example how do PHP developers install

439
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,700
composer does anybody know does anybody

440
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:23,840
know where on<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading with this already</font>

441
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,840
the instructions look kind of like this

442
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,540
so what they're doing is they're taking

443
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,490
data pulling it off the internet with

444
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,550
curl without doing anything else with it

445
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,430
immediately executing it we have more

446
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,470
examples on curl pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> shi tumblr com I</font>

447
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,550
don't maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by the way it should</font>

448
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,890
go without saying this is a bad idea

449
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,030
don't type to your shell just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

450
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,260
there's two things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong one if</font>

451
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,700
you're in point gets compromised and

452
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,590
somebody puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Trojan horse on there</font>

453
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,290
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer's owned you</font>

454
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,419
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> GG play again um the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

455
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can go wrong is if you're running a</font>

456
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,200
if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> REM RF</font>

458
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,370
absolute path and it cuts off I think

459
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,080
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a double you get</font>

460
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,679
specific one but still running untrusted

461
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,060
et untrusted code you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

462
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,800
Tory will delete every file on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

463
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,040
system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> user has access to because</font>

464
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,350
it cuts off and still runs it so yeah

465
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,149
it's just a bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> all around don't</font>

466
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,959
pipe to your shell so let's talk about

467
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,520
secure code delivery so most people when

468
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,930
you download software I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font>

469
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to download something like tor or tails</font>

470
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,440
they published a pgp signature----- of

471
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,740
their software

472
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,850
and that does help a lot but<font color="#CCCCCC"> securecode</font>

473
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">delivery itself is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

474
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,840
surprisingly non-trivial security

475
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,020
problem there's actually three nuances

476
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually make something secure the</font>

477
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one is cryptographic signatures is</font>

478
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,560
it signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person who is</font>

479
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,570
authorized to release it you know and

480
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">this doesn't mean an md5 hash by the way</font>

481
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,560
this means something like our essay or

482
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,790
fdsa something with asymmetric

483
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,129
cryptography so that way you have a

484
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,570
private key<font color="#CCCCCC"> that only you can sign the</font>

485
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,510
key then you publish it and everyone's

486
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,250
can verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> it md5 hashes shot you hashes</font>

487
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,240
it doesn't matter if somebody can hack

488
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,310
your server they can replace it with

489
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,670
another hash but if you use something

490
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,899
like PGP organ<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPG you can actually you</font>

491
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,460
know download<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public key in your</font>

492
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust store and then you're secure going</font>

493
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">future they're going into the future so</font>

494
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,899
long as you actually you know have the

495
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,899
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your system it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also makes it very</font>

496
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,440
difficult to forge a signature the next

497
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:27,300
one is reproducible builds a lot of

498
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,110
Debian projects are actually moving

499
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,100
towards this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm basically if you build</font>

500
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,689
it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source you should get the</font>

501
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,520
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they're providing with you</font>

502
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,570
you know providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with sometimes</font>

503
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,400
you'll have things that differ like

504
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,350
build timestamps you really can't help

505
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,150
that but in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fewest things</font>

506
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,070
that differ the easier it is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

507
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,570
the code or trust the deliverable

508
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,800
because you can look at the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see</font>

509
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,939
what it does and then you can look at

510
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,700
the deliverable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say okay it does the</font>

511
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,350
same thing and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the more</font>

512
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,690
interesting one here user base

513
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,760
consistency verification making sure

514
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that every user gets the same thing in a</font>

515
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that's mathematically provable um</font>

516
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:09,230
this actually isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trivial to</font>

517
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,640
solve so the reason this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is considered</font>

518
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,010
part of the triangle<font color="#CCCCCC"> securecode delivery</font>

519
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,170
is that if the NSA were to hack let's

520
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,520
say get composer org and say if your IP

521
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,810
address comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saudi Arabia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

522
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,120
going to give you a different payload

523
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,440
they could do targeted attacks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

524
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,060
you have a way to verify that everybody

525
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,920
has the same exact piece of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

526
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,480
they're getting you suddenly took that

527
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,140
equation out you took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

528
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,430
equation and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point good luck at</font>

529
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,410
hacking it if you have cryptographic

530
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,090
signatures your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill is reproducible</font>

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,360
implied by recruit reproducible builds

533
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,340
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify everybody's getting</font>

534
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,020
the same package in order to attack

535
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,580
anybody you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack everybody and</font>

536
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,750
retort order to attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody you</font>

537
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,399
have to announce your<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence it</font>

538
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,410
becomes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to would do a stealth</font>

539
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,330
attack with that and if you have

540
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,610
somebody who's doing a signing that has

541
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,129
discipline that air gaps their machines

542
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:59,360
properly and doesn't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just i'm</font>

543
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:01,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use PGP for win I don't see how</font>

544
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,580
you would actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to trivially</font>

545
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,379
get into a system like that so these

546
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,090
three properties in mind can we build a

547
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:14,150
system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> offers secure code delivery</font>

securely allows you to securely acquire

an update your packages uses

security and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that</font>

580
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,720
everybody anybody who had who uses

581
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,679
Asgard to run their own that notary

582
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:43,290
server so each block is signed with a

583
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:46,220
well each leaf in a tree is signed by a

584
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:49,110
private key that we maintain<font color="#CCCCCC"> on each</font>

585
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,380
block is a miracle tree based on the

586
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,570
blake to be hash everything we publishes

587
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,550
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the distributed ledger private</font>

588
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,870
packages are available if you have a

589
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,980
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want a private package</font>

590
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,280
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do is that will give you a</font>

591
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:06,420
license key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curve to</font>

592
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,010
5519 key pair and will actually encrypt

593
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,360
it with your public key and send it to

594
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,830
use only you can decrypt it and publish

595
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,330
it in the ledger so you get the same

596
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,080
consistency verification but nobody

597
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows the details your privacy software</font>

598
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,710
notaries must agree before anything is

599
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,120
installed that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fail-safe so</font>

600
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have people thrown in a</font>

601
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,659
bunch of civil attacks oh we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51</font>

602
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,100
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network we can attack it</font>

603
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,850
and convince people that you know this

604
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:32,969
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong um every notary has its own</font>

605
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,649
signing key using a head to 5519<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

607
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,730
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signature expires so</font>

608
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,110
replay attacks don't work and the key is

609
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,520
pinned so when you add a notary it

610
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,409
actually pins it to where no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

611
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,000
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that or nobody can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

612
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,080
substitute it like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had you know</font>

613
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,359
like a ssl certificate

614
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,379
when we add a package to Asgard<font color="#E5E5E5"> we give</font>

615
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,460
it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> detailed audit the first time</font>

616
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,658
through we look for any obvious

617
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,759
vulnerabilities we look for anything

618
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:58,039
that jumps out at us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go through with</font>

619
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,539
a fine-tooth comb essentially anything

620
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,340
we find is of course we maintain to the

621
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:05,269
vulnerability or to the maintainer

622
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,100
because we don't hoard zero days um both

623
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,139
the initial ease and every update will

624
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,359
be looked over by us<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we sign off</font>

625
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:13,248
on anything if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the originals</font>

626
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,408
pretty swell then the subsequent ones

627
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:16,850
won't be looked at to carefully but if

628
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,440
we see anything that's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

629
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,168
somebody put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back door in here we're</font>

630
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,779
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to prove it one of the things</font>

631
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for is</font>

632
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:26,809
reproducible builds because as I

633
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,249
mentioned if you can reproduce the

634
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:29,149
software from the source code you can

635
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:33,350
guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the right</font>

636
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:36,049
thing if the build script is different

637
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,699
we market is it produces a zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte if</font>

638
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,739
we market<font color="#E5E5E5"> it executable if there's</font>

639
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,989
anything wrong even a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp by even</font>

640
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:44,350
a second we mark it as non reproducible

641
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:49,389
and we also will make comments about it

642
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,389
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show you real quick</font>

643
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Asgard in motion along</font>

644
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,030
so can anybody see that

645
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:11,320
let me see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can increase the font</font>

646
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:11,320
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> your book where's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my mouse</font>

647
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,140
well

648
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,139
ok

649
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:39,749
there's

650
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,309
we're small size

651
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel oh there we go</font>

652
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,970
sorry it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to see if the</font>

653
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">single</font>

654
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:18,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better yeah cool so I'm just going</font>

655
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get composure so what assuming this</font>

656
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,970
it's actually synchronizing from Allah

657
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,750
notary did I have set up hoping the

658
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,750
internet doesn't kill this

659
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,070
maybe you did

660
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:51,229
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. Palmer</font>

661
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,230
oh there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

662
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,140
mmm so I probably shouldn't show you the

663
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,590
director for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand but if you look at the</font>

664
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">timestamp it grabbed composer verified</font>

665
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,870
it did all the stuff in the background

666
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:11,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just it in motion it's really</font>

667
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you right now what it</font>

668
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,110
actually does under the hood without

669
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:18,990
creping through a sequel light database

670
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:22,580
but that's the project in essence now

671
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me see where it was in the slideshow</font>

672
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,350
oh there we go

673
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so let's look at a comparison on</font>

674
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,540
how to attack these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> co delivery</font>

methods with<font color="#CCCCCC"> composure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise gift</font>

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,580
compromise our air gap machine that we

mostly in the theoretical realm there's
