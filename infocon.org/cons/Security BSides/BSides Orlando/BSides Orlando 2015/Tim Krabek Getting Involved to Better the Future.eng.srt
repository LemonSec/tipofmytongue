7
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:29,259
our community and more specifically I've

8
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,210
been doing a lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,750
cavalry over the past couple years who's

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,809
heard of the eye of the cavalry movement

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">no okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am the cavalry basically</font>

12
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,010
came about when a group of guys were

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,590
staying at a conference drinking and

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,750
having fun and they realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,750
is going to send the cavalry in for us

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,840
and solve art and for all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our info</font>

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,570
SEC problems we have to do it we have to

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,750
help other industries we have to help

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">people solve these problems ourselves so</font>

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,690
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own cavalry so as</font>

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,690
I am the cavalry

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,829
so the problem statement know where the

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,180
slide came from this is weird because

24
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,699
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I'm seeing down below</font>

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,860
which is nice but our society is

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,289
adopting connected technology faster

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,390
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're able to secure it you know</font>

28
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:28,789
who's heard about that little buzzword

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,990
cool my thermostat was connected so I

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,640
could do it over my phone what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my</font>

34

00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,799
alarm goes off and whatever else it

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,390
tells the toaster<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start toasting</font>

toast in there until it catches on fire

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:06,119
I don't know so the mission statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,758
I am the cavalry that's right here you

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,489
guys can read it we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> focused a lot on</font>

medical automotive<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connected home</font>

and the public infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical is</font>

49
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,480
easy it's the medical devices all the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,200
stuff related to hospitals it's easy to

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:29,130
describe hard to secure automobile is a

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,018
lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensors the wireless</font>

basically connects everything together

55
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,769
and the connected home is about all the

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,389
IOT that everyone just throws in her

57

house and doesn't care what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

58
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:47,670
with it who's heard about the synology

vez que des the ICS systems the you know

68
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,090
the cameras at tried the traffic lights

69
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,589
not the cameras of the traffic laws

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,580
because the traffic lights themselves in

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,260
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places they may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

diagnostic or walk up a little hand

thing and control them from there so you

79
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,899
can't cause habit with that either one

here so if you're a car company you say

about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of a skyscraper in a</font>

00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:08,769
cool they've got in the newer combines

229
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:14,379
and stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use to process all</font>

230
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:15,879
the brain fart vegetables and corn

231
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,589

automatically pulling that over

233
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:24,129
analyzing the quality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font>

234
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:26,379
field determining is this you know three

dollar a bushel corn for animals is it

236
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,660
$12 bushel corn for people what have you

237
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,790
now imagine if you knew this information

238
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,049
before the stuff got off the field so

239
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,748
you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through and say</font>

240
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:42,519
great as a farmer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is awesome I want</font>

241
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:44,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run two or three trucks out here I</font>

242
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,419
get into lower grade corn I'm gonna pull

243
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,459
in one hopper they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take this</font>

244
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,749
or affair that over to you know three

245
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,669
dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bushel they're gonna feed it to</font>

246
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:54,100
the animals I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more expensive</font>

247
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:56,350
stuff over there I pull another loader

248
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,730
in there we take that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it over</font>

249
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,309
to the people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get twelve dollars a</font>

250
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,829
bushel now a little bit affairs I say

251
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:05,649
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I think a nine dollar</font>

252
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,529
spread would be worth me going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

253
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:12,669
buying some of this so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

254
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:14,589
inject on the radio hear that uh-oh to

255
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:17,289
look at this corn coming off its not

256
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:19,359
that good for people you know what it

257
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:21,639
might not even be that good for analyst

258
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:23,619
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we'll still take it</font>

259
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing ethanol because we</font>

260
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:27,850
can produce it that way we'll buy it

261
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:31,689
even cheaper now we get it back to our

262
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,609
lab and we reevaluate and go this

263
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:35,709
quality is nowhere near as low as we

264
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:38,499
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this is fit for</font>

265
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,979
consumption by people now I can take

266
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,500
that

267
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,149
maybe I bought it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about $52 of</font>

268
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,029
motion and now i'm selling it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 10 or</font>

269
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,100
12 because my lab has verified<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's now</font>

270
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,290
good wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> as crappy as i told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

271
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,930
farmers equipment it was and bought it

272
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,420
for really cheap so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

273
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,849
stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming computerized but</font>

274
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,399
if you think nefariously you can get in

275
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,829
and make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do things that not</font>

276
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:10,269
necessarily kill people but benefit you

277
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:12,939

284
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,620
on TV and spent all sorts of really

argue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attorney okay are you an</font>

what they're talking about but they

350
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,269

down and you can get frustrated and say

352

the wrong thing at the wrong time

353
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,540

critical vulnerability in the HR system

572
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,729
that you know we kind of need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch</font>

573
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:19,719

576
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:25,749
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure that her</font>

the accounts here we call and notify all

579
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,559
the banks and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this other stuff</font>

580

this is a real problem right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here right</font>

to log into the system and during our

accounts that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

586
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:51,309
important than the ntp reflection that

587
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:53,589
may affect us but probably will affect

really great job of coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and going</font>

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information there but that's</font>

608
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,070
part of the media training I think you

609
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:05,409
know when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got people out there</font>

look if you've got anything on

612
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,360
technology I'll be glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

against that

619
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,120
do you have a hackerspace really give a

afraid of computers that kind of stuff

629
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the type of community involvement</font>
