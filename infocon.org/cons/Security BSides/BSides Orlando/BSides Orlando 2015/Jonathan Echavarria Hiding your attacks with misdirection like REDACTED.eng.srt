doing is we're gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a look at</font>

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,559
techniques and methodologies applied by

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,590
advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent threat groups and</font>

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,160
then how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as penetration testers</font>

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,350
hackers and whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are Ken</font>

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,550
utilizes methodologies to you know

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,280
basically become more effective and have

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,569
your campaign be more effective so some

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,780
of these groups you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may know</font>

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,890
the you may heard of the NSA you may

heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ the PLA electronic warfare</font>

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,400
division those kinds of groups and we're

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,869
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a quick look at what they</font>

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,259
do so if you are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a good</font>

29
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:25,799
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not it but let's get</font>

a little wave right off the bat let's

55
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,500
talk about government capabilities and

56
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,299
capabilities of these apt groups I don't

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,830
care who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the government is going</font>

58
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,630
to have more money than you they're

<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly hope to get and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font>

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot more leverage and you</font>

62
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,569
could ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly hope to get so don't</font>

64
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as good as then because</font>

65
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,599
unless you're rich and really really

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,470
really really really rich which you're

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,410

other hand advanced persistent threat

69
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,519
groups don't necessarily have to be tied

70
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,130
to government um you know by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,930
standard definition advanced persistent

72
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:18,920
threats or just hackers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are better</font>

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:23,400
than your regular script kiddies so yeah

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a little forewarning I'm</font>

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,950
gonna we're gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to school</font>

76
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,280
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you a little</font>

77
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">history on these you know advanced apt</font>

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
groups or whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call them</font>

79
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,660
just bear with me but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,670
what we're doing this kind of take note

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,350
of you know the evolution of their

82
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,208
methodologies and their tactics and how

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,530
it's changed over time starting in

84
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,380
nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight we'll take a look</font>

85
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,690
at this campaign called moonlight maze

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,000
basically what happened was the US was

87
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,609
parsing logs whatever and they found

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice some electronic probing of you</font>

89
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,230
know

90
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pentagon systems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DOD systems department</font>

91
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,600
of energy and other like research labs

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,910
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and something to</font>

93
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,340
take note of is that humans are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,020
weakest link security we all notice we

95
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an intrinsic flaw built into our</font>

96
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,760
systems and basically we love routine

97
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,070
and we hate change because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this fact</font>

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,140
that enables blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> teens to leverage</font>

99
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,750
things like pattern analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

100
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,090
help collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> better intelligence against</font>

101
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,740
people so with moonlight maze you know

102
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,570
some of the log patterns that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,350
were that hey these people are working

104
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">in an office that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of matches up in</font>

105
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,110
you know that all the activity that

106
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're seeing is between eight to five</font>

107
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,720
moscow time now we're chasing these logs

108
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:48,489
and we trace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back to a server in</font>

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Moscow I wonder who did that in 2003</font>

110
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,840
there was another campaign called Titan

111
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:57,550
ring these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on defense</font>

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,830
contractors and DOD and the attack

113
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,930
vectors for these was social engineering

114
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,520
emails it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight the</font>

115
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,290
fact this fact because they did an

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,590
extensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of reconnaissance</font>

117
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,540
before performing their initial attacks

118
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,020
recon is key to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the success of these</font>

119
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,660
campaigns better recon leads to better

120
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,430
social engineering attacks all the

121
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,580
all the communications actually ended up

122
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,050
getting traced back to China now that

123
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,789
wasn't the chats not say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a</font>

124
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,710
Chinese<font color="#E5E5E5"> government but it got traced</font>

125
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,380
back to China in 2006 there was psyche

126
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">pas this was a really really</font>

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,659
sophisticated campaign that targeted key

128
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,310
us industries such as telecommunications

129
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">harbor manufacturers defense contractors</font>

130
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,870
and aerospace organizations unlike a lot

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,460
of bots at the time psyche block clients

132
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,040
didn't talk back to the command control

133
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,870
server at regular intervals so it was a

134
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,340
lot difficult especially for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools</font>

135
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist at a time to notice that</font>

136
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,260
initially you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most botnets</font>

137
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,820
they'll communicate every 30 minutes

138
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,210
back to the C&C server just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

139
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,250
check back if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say hey check in</font>

140
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,159
15 minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then next check in 30</font>

141
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,850
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the next check in 32 min</font>

142
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really throws off and just manual</font>

143
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,700
analysis at humans there because you're

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for patterns right there was</font>

145
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,219
some other really interesting

146
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,340
characteristics from the malware

147
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,050

<font color="#CCCCCC">their DLLs that they use for</font>

149
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,330
exploitation as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft dll's that's</font>

150
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,820
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy stuff to do take a</font>

151
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,960
resource editor right flick say hey

152
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,560
let's change it from saying oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god I</font>

153
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,130
run an evil corporation LLC to microsoft

154
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,800
corporation that actually hides a lot

155
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,540
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you think that mean you may</font>

156
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,890
consider exactly exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it also had</font>

157
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,800
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other characteristics that would</font>

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,630

160
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,340
for like time patterns it kind of hides

161
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,400
itself and then it's at this really

162
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool technique to perform</font>

163
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,200
persistence which was kind of cutting

164
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:16,500
edge at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually you</font>

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:19,020
know see the actual the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

166
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what it does is it deletes its</font>

167
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,000

remove any traces of resistance<font color="#E5E5E5"> e1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram</font>

170
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,799
so when you when you put up the computer

171
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,260
you can't see it being when it's

172
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,820
executed a new thread is created that

173
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,150
detects the ending of a window session

174
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,919
only when<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows exits does it relocate</font>

175
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,919
itself to the startup folder to survive

176
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,289
reboot since it only exists in startup

177
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,840
folder when required live analysis

178
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,120
techniques probably miss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> when startup</font>

179
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,950
entries are inspected and again you know

180
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of analysts that</font>

185
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,580
in 2009 there was a campaign named ghost

186
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,710
am very very extensive and it's

187
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,590
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of tell</font>

188
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,960
a lot about you know the Mauer operators

189
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,060
about who's controlling and who's

190
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,460
performing these campaigns by their

191
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,470
targets you'll see here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's had a</font>

going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intrinsic flaw of</font>

security and how humans are stupid let's

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,719
do a google search for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this motto and</font>

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:04,030
ooh you come up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new blog title the</font>

board soldiers blog space at this point

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,079
you know assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're the same</font>

evidence to you I must say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

233
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,970
activated my check

234
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,320
basically the fact of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter is it's</font>

235
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,810
somehow these two personas share the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,529
same motto the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> birthplace in the</font>

same<font color="#E5E5E5"> birth place of residence I mean</font>

238
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:48,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of indicates that they're</font>

239
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:50,290
probably the same person but in all

240
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,110
seriousness don't cross contaminate your

241
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,630
handles you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a public handle you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can have a private handle make new</font>

243
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:05,320
handles for each campaign be random ops

<font color="#E5E5E5">X key but not enough apparently in 2010</font>

245
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,120
there was another one called Operation

246
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,350
Aurora now this one was kind of

247
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,300
interesting just because of who they

248
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,279
were targeting right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

249
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,709

250
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,430

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,540
one of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were targeted and</font>

253
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,730
whenever they realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey these</font>

254
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,529
people were probably Chinese they

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Chinese market because</font>

256
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:34,949
of it ultimately the goal of this miss

257
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,170
campaign was to put malicious code in

258
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:41,380
pro in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code base of solutions before</font>

259
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,990
they even left the market you're

260
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,519
downloading trusted programs and now

261
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,920
they're packed with mauer that no one

262
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">even knows about that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ultimate win</font>

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,939
at that point um the commander control

264
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,980
servers were also hosted on rackspace

265
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,829
accounts so they could post these up

266
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,390
anywhere and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder to you</font>

267
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,430
know determine where these were coming

<font color="#E5E5E5">from although looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the source of</font>

host and intelligence facility huh

273
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,160
and then there's 2010 with one of my

274
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,920
favorite campaigns<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuxnet these</font>

275
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,379
targeted the Iranians and their nuclear

276
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,479
control facilities it was amazing it's a

277
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:28,350
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated campaign that</font>

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,870
supposedly<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some origins of American</font>

279
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:35,399
and/or Israeli you know characteristics

280
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,100
it's a self-cleaning malware and by

281
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,860
exploiting 40 days it would cause really

282
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,019
it would cause I you know nuclear

283
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,809
centrifuges to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend really really fast</font>

284
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,839
and pretty much explode it had three

285
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">modules one that was the worm that</font>

execute the propagated copies of the

290
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,329
for hiding malicious files and processes

291

293
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,930
about this is that scared the bejesus

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">out ever going was the fact that it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that scared a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and you know</font>

301
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,870
initially most people thought the

303
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,420
they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guy that had access to a</font>

304
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,779
USB and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to drop us be in</font>

305
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,319
there what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't normally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

306

essentially these guys also the Iranians

they all are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space so you</font>

each other and when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a foot hole</font>

335
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,620
in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that really really helps</font>

336
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,970
the amount of reconnaissance that you

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,650
can do and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to collect much</font>

afterwards it hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cal electric who's</font>

345
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,860
as to how all this happen you know

346
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,689
they're good they're going to send a

380
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,690
you know any passerby so if these are

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,639
hosted on VPS or you know like Rackspace

382

to say oh this server seems to be doing

threatening this was likely done to

394
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:14,189
deceive those guys in 2013 there was

another<font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign called rain awesome</font>

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:18,120
really really incredibly sophisticated

malware ever get a chance read the

398
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,520
analysis paper on it because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

399
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,589
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know very highly modular uses</font>

400
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,790
the same technique to mimic Microsoft

401
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,110
drivers and it had a pretty wide target

402
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,240
specifically a lot of those targets just

403
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,580
happen to be in telecommunications so

404
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,750
you're kind of attacking infrastructure

405
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:42,090
at that point it employed a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

406
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of antique forensics and it</font>

407
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,129
also used a custom-built virtual file

408
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,929
system and even alternative encryption

409
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,880
just encryption types that weren't

410
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:52,820
commonly used or just slightly modified

411
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,010
the encryption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being used</font>

412
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,870
another key thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at is the fact</font>

413
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,090
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> used multiple means of protocols</font>

414
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,370
talk back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CNC server so it's not</font>

415
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">just talking back over IRC or PGP or</font>

416
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,360
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's using ICMP cookies IRC p2p</font>

417
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just using a multitude of protocols</font>

418
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,570
so that it's a lot harder to figure out

419
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,570
how data is feeding exfiltrated

420
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,949
it remained undetected for a long time

421
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,650
because of you know they try to hide it

422
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,390
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they cook we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

423
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,890
a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention to the belt rom hack</font>

424
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:33,490
2013 that was unofficially done by GCHQ

425
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,640
um they're using a little bit more

426
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,530
interesting attack vector basically what

427
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,060
happened is they can't assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

428
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,430
compromised the backbone of the internet

right or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of Bel jicama</font>

430
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,500
they pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much just man in the middle</font>

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I see you're going to LinkedIn before</font>

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you go to LinkedIn I'm going to

435
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,680
intersect your request upload a little

436
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,420
bit of you know execute code that's

437
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,070
going to execute and then pass you

438
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,130
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LinkedIn oh and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I have a</font>

439
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,320
shell in your box sorry um you can

440
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,210
literally inject code in transit

441
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,350
transparently by intercepting the

442
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,460
requests and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to do is</font>

443
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,870
control network infrastructure another

444
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,030
key point is the fact that they

445
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,060
performed really really extensive

446
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:24,120
reconnaissance reconnaissance leads to

447
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:30,280
success that's a fact use reconnaissance

448
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,679
yeah all right history lessons done you

449
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,510
guys can wake up now let's take a quick

450
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,580
peek at some of the methodologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

451
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,040
just properties of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

452
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,490
attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then how we can use them to</font>

453
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,980
hack all the things rule number one<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

454
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> location have you seen see to server</font>

455
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,620
don't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it where you're attacking from</font>

456
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,560
that's retarded you know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

457
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,649
using junk boxes and but I'm my<font color="#E5E5E5"> see two</font>

458
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,760
servers right next to me in Florida is

459
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,380
that really the smartest thing to do

460
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine if the u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> launched</font>

461
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,510
their attacks from an IP address located

462
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fort meade gee I wonder who did that</font>

463
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,330
so for penetration testers that means

464
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,270
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call don't use the host name of</font>

465
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,970
your botnet as<font color="#CCCCCC"> c2 dot your company name</font>

466
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,330
com that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very smart and for</font>

467
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,940
governments<font color="#E5E5E5"> host that out of the country</font>

468
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:28,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple partners why don't you</font>

469
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,190
host your attack from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sweden or host</font>

470
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,560
your attack from I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a server</font>

471
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,900
you probably owned in China and for

472
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:40,129
malware operators you guys are black

473
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:43,100
hats hack people China many many

474
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,320
vulnerable systems own them and use them

475
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,949
VPS operators have been doing this for

476
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,710
years takings from them for extra kudos

477
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really cool you guys can</font>

480
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,600
technique that they it's called a fourth

481

party collection called the pliant

482
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,340
warrior and essentially they penetrate

483
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,730
while you penetrate while you're getting

484
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,530
penetrator right they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at</font>

485
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,460
existing botnet servers and see two

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,930
servers you know there's plenty out

493
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,220
somehow it gets discovered there's

already someone else running another

495

obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data is being communicated</font>

500
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,940
back to you you must be be at fault that

501
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,770
will really really hinder the

502
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,630
investigation process don't get me wrong

503
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,250
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ee service associated with this</font>

504
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,500
technique like the fact that your

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,950

click me and you're good to go the more

beginning and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay spearfishing is</font>

530
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,730
done now will launch an attack when you

531
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,889
own a box start performing recon at that

532

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that vantage point start performing</font>

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">just really build a solid database of</font>

attacks much more effectively another

537
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,590
key characteristic of these campaigns

538
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,850
has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> patience let's look at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sucks net group they waited an entire</font>

and it wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> from viagra slow and</font>

546
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,480
methodical movements tend to be much

547
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,710
more pleasurable for an attacker in the

548
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,710
long run so tread lightly

549
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,510
and anti forensics one of my favorites

550
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,980
so there's some common anti forensic

551
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,080
techniques shared across all of these

552
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:50,130
you know different different campaigns

553
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,289
they utilize secure secure delete shred

554
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,889
overwrite a file with<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and it's</font>

555
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:58,769
suddenly nearly impossible to recover

556
00:23:54,889 --> 00:24:00,899
for the rain see two servers the way

557
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,760
that they were discovered they were at

558
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:05,070
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able to recover an</font>

560
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,750
hosting from the you know VPS provider

561
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,190
because they were like hey we noticed

562
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these were being used in a malware</font>

563

campaign can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide us with an</font>

image of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boss and they said sure</font>

565
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,449
what the sea two operators actually

566
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:19,980
ended up doing initially was they

567
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,620
disabled all the logs including web

568
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,590
server logs so there was no logs

569
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,029
whatsoever located on the box you know

570
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,320
you might think but they have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

571
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:31,080
and they can sink hole de campagne

572
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,178
whatever that won't give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a history</font>

573
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,928
of previous clients so say for example

574
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,850
you deleted you know pots that you

575
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,049
compromised there earlier you're not

576
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,699
going to be able to trace that<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

577
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:45,299

could obviously outside of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

splits off and sends the data to to the

and always use the bright protocol for

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,908
administrator during a penetration test

723
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,459
by sending him a<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

724
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:05,409
keyboard that had a keylogger hidden

725
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,849
inside of it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

726
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,409
state-of-the-art<font color="#CCCCCC"> logitech once Ellison</font>

727
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:11,769
mechanical keyboard thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

728
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:13,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">a valued logitech customer as as a we've</font>

729
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,149
decided to send you this gift as a

730
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:18,039
promotion soon administrators everyone

731
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:19,928
loves free stuff they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

732
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">use of it take advantage of it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

733
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:27,039
all his key strokes are being sent out

734
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,149
that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilize that another key</font>

735
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,200
characteristic of these government

736
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:32,349
groups is that they're intercepting

737
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,389
routers and delivery to tart locations

738
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:39,840
and in planning mauer before they arrive

739
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:47,859
nope tampering<font color="#E5E5E5"> with mail is illegal but</font>

740
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:51,129
who cares also aim lower firmware based

741
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:53,499
attacks hard drive attacks rootkits

742
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:55,269
their way harder to do but they're

743
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:59,169
really incredibly awesome and they allow

744
00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:02,559
for much much longer persistence so we

745
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:04,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a program like NSA's i r8</font>

746
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,029
monk<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's used by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their tailored access</font>

747
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:09,158
operations groups and it you know

748
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,249
provides application persistence by

749
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:15,460
targeting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MBR at that point even if</font>

750
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:22,239
you wipe the OS it doesn't matter it the

751
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">computers still owned so the next key</font>

752
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:27,549
point is to throw the trail on your tail

753
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,229
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of power and based</font>

754
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:33,759
analysis that goes into you know

755
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:36,340
identifying who an operator is writing

756
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,929
style gives a lot away there's an

757
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,609
application called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the if you go to the</font>

758
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,889
Hemingway<font color="#E5E5E5"> Act where you can do is you</font>

759
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:43,840
can take a block<font color="#E5E5E5"> of text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pasted into it</font>

760
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:47,469
and it'll say you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably change</font>

761
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,539
these it essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> hemingway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out looks</font>

762
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,759
at your writing style and says this is

763
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:53,799
way too advanced for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5th graders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

764
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,599
dump<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sentence down eliminate the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun</font>

765
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,158
and stun this down done this down change

766
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,799
that around and suddenly it doesn't look

767
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you wrote it anymore change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

768
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,389
identity use multiple handles for

769
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:06,369
multiple campaigns don't use your<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

770
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:07,909
handle for everything that can be traced

771
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:11,780
back to you

772
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:14,030
it's easy fake name generator calm click

773
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,280
generate click randomized and now you're

774
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:20,690
a whole new person and don't cross

775
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,250
contaminate your handles if you can have

776
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,170
a public handle that you do for IT

777
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,940
research right to security research

778
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,610
whatever you know hey you'll release

779
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,180
your your advisories that you discover

780
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">over that but if you're hacking stuff on</font>

781
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">your night job don't use the same handle</font>

782
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:41,209
for that so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have any</font>

783
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,449
questions I there's the best place

784
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,190
contact me or over jabber or Twitter um

785
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:53,030
you know it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the top but</font>

786
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:55,490
you guys have any questions now I will

787
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,760
put that on my blog but that's a great

788
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,760
point

789
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,010
because they post think that that's like

790
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">a huge red flag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dns server result</font>

791
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:19,750
even better be dns server so because

792
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,668
that's rarely ever detected even better

793
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,699
even better that that goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

794
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:26,139
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was saying expand your targets</font>

795
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:38,889
control infrastructure and you control

796
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:41,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything right questions even there so</font>

797
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:45,359
yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sending my top and this</font>

798
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,360
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been enjoy b-sides</font>

799
