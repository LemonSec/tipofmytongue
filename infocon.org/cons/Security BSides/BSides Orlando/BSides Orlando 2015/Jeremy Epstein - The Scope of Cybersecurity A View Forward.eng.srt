00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,689
something that eventually does go away

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,390
it was driven home to me a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,230
time was the premiere place to work and

49

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,730

job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days at Bell Labs</font>

59
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:35,500
people were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what they</font>

called convergence and what they meant

by convergence in 1980

62
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:46,310
182 was we're gonna get telephones and

data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the same thing it's like huh</font>

64
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,299
what are you talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,890
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense it was really far-fetched</font>

66
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,269
and so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ideas i'm going</font>

67
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,458
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about here today maybe they're</font>

68
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,030
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that far-fetched but when we talk</font>

69
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,650
about convergence today some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

70
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,620
things we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> already and some of</font>

71
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,209
them are coming so environmental sensing

72
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,670
we can have sensors for all sorts of

73
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that are all connected to our</font>

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,540
computing networks we know this is true

75
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,579
we have emergency response<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font>

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,709
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about quadcopters being</font>

77
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:37,170
demoed here today I hope there's an FAA

78
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:41,250
license for doing this it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font>

79
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,958
together which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really good smart</font>

80

devices health devices and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you wear fitbit's or similar things not</font>

82
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,840
very good I'm kind of surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wear</font>

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,250
one it motivates me to actually walk

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,919
more instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking the elevators</font>

85
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,190
people who have insulin pumps I was a

86
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,510
meeting a couple days ago in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley</font>

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,250
with a

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,739
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that he is a type 1</font>

89
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,480
diabetic and used to have an insulin

90
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,810
pump but then he looked at the security

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,578
ramifications and stopped using this on

92
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,589
pumping now manually injects himself

93
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,329
with insulin because he's just scared of

94
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,130
someone hacked in his insulin pump and

95
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,550
this is a guy who actually understands

96
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,460
he's not he's not just paranoid I said

97
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">gesture he is paranoid I don't think</font>

98
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,409
anyone really is up to get him but it's

99
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">not an unreasonable question how many of</font>

100
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,940
you heard about Vice President Dick

101

Cheney in and his implanted

102
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,710

103
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,520
pacemaker I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was anyway um may</font>

104
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">have heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had his is not the</font>

106
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:59,340
off the remote programming capability

107
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,220
because he had seen some research<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

that someone could remotely reprogram

present case the Vice President<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dick</font>

been a bad thing but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,469
so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs our thermostats how many of</font>

121
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:34,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about the samsung TV case</font>

122
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:35,990
recently so so someone tell me just real

123
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,029
quick well this is sunday morning

124
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,159
everyone's tired everyone would rather

125
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:44,870
be in bed what was the essence of the

126
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:47,449
samsung TV problem it listens to you so

127
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,069
when you turn on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

128
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,509
it on and background<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's listening to</font>

129
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:54,080
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's uploading everything you</font>

130
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,120
say into a cloud system somewhere to

131
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,279
interpret it where you say turn on CNN

132
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,080
or turn on whatever Nickelodeon or

133
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,969
whatever or turn the volume up or down

134
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,818
but it's also capturing whatever random

135
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:10,819
stuff is going on in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that</font>

136
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,569
freaks a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but what if</font>

137
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:18,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">your light bulb is listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you that</font>

138
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:21,740
ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> no do our white bulb smart</font>

139
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,800
yeah there was a case a few months ago

140
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:30,919
where someone figured out how to break

141
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:33,229
into home networks via light bulbs huh

142
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,599
it turns out there's there's enough in

143
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,580
some of the smart LED based light bulbs

144
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,959
there's enough encryption technology

145
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,270
that they communicate the light bulbs

146
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,830
talk to each other to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm burning</font>

147
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,109
out or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say I don't know</font>

148
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,520
what they say um and there was enough

149
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,680
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> weakness in there that you</font>

150
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,779
could jump through the light bulb

151
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,949
metaphorically<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> onto a</font>

152
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:57,229
home network so all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

153
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,439
coming together and the threats are

154
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:04,550
coming together<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and as the threats</font>

155
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:08,089
come together is harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape them</font>

156
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,190
unless you do as a colleague of mine did

157
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:13,890
and you live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tent in</font>

158
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:18,300
it's the middle of Missouri he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

159
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:23,099
I'm sorry Missouri excuse me apologize

160
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,800
for my pronunciation he does go into

161
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">town and get on facebook though which I</font>

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,250
haven't quite figured out if he really

163
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,930
wants to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much off the grid that</font>

164
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,500
he lives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tent in the middle of</font>

165
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,850
Missouri why does he go into town and

166
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,930
he's not doing it because money he's

167
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,540
doing it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he really wants to be</font>

168
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,270
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the grid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm quite good all of</font>

169
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,140
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are coming together how</font>

170
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:50,789
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use Facebook or similar oh</font>

171
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">come on don't lie everyone there's a lot</font>

172
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">more that's coming together the facebook</font>

173
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,370
can figure out by integrating your data

174
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,070
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from all these other</font>

175
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:07,800
sources and so as we put all these

176
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:11,909
technologies together we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,600
about how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we prevent misuse how do we</font>

178
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:19,560
democratize and scale what happens in in

179
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,630
in repressive countries have things like

180
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,570
Facebook been used for good in

181
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,860
repressive countries sure the Arab

182
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:33,120
Spring had a huge was hugely impacted

183
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:37,250
and enabled by Facebook but they also

184
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">been used to repress people absolutely</font>

185
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,900
repressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments are monitoring</font>

186
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,450
social media and using them against

187
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,990
people and as we integrate all these

188
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:52,800
technologies together the opportunities

189
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,260
for both good and evil expand we're

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build workforce capacity</font>

191
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,240
through these technologies we're going

192
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,400
to enable fairness and opportunity so

193
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,260
let me give you an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,549
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good study that we</font>

195
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,429
funded

196
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:11,608
out of my program at NSF by<font color="#E5E5E5"> alessandro</font>

198
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:15,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what they did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they made up some</font>

199
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,039
fake identities this is a technique

200
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's well understood in social science</font>

201
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:25,929
circles they made up fake identities on

202
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:28,299
a social network sites one more

203
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,919
typically social networking and one

204
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:32,319
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more professional social</font>

205
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,259
networking you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

206
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:36,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are but he never said but you</font>

207
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:40,379
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can figure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

208
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:46,679
what what he did is he created two

209
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:51,159
resumes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional one that</font>

210
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:54,249
differed only in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of factors and</font>

211
00:09:51,159 --> 00:10:01,149
then they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit and matching</font>

212
00:09:54,249 --> 00:10:03,459
social networking pages that that match

213
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,799
the two and they use names that were

214
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:08,469
unmistakable that there were no other

215
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,379
name so there wasn't John Smith or Mary

216
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,409
Smith it was names that only one person

217
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:16,209
in the entire world if he googled him

218
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,709
only one person<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

219
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,738
won't tell me what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are because he</font>

220
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,779
doesn't want me to accidentally use the

221
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:25,929
hand that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> break their system and</font>

222
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:28,659
so the team the neighbor gene variations

223
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:33,269
and on one of the social network pages

224
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,269
it would show a person holding

225
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,060
bottled beer and on the other one would

226
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,189
show them holding a can of soda with

227
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,829
their friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one of them it</font>

228
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,529
would show them hugging a person of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

229
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,200
opposite gender and the other page

230
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:53,290
hugginson of the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> gender & 1 the</font>

231
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,270
person would be white on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other would</font>

232
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,599
be african-american on one it would be

233
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone expressing their interest in</font>

234
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,860
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a christian church and on the</font>

235
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,980
other it would be expressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

236
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,510
interest in going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mosque and so he</font>

237
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,120
measure and then they said they

238
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,660
submitted the same resumes to real job

239
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,540
openings and they measured what the

240
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,520
results were who got called who would be

241
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,410
state people got called for interviews

242
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,730
was really kind of interesting they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

243
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:30,400
got the registrar's office to agree to

244
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">have fake transcripts that if anyone</font>

245
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">called up to check references to check</font>

246
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,410
is this really nice to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin what's</font>

247
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,630
in transit so they had the same tape

248
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,040
transcripts just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty amazingly they</font>

249
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,240
got there and then they measured what

250
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,110
happened and the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

251
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,050
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad as we thought the bad news was</font>

252
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,420
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where in a country the jobs</font>

253
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,699
were there was still real discrimination

254
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,400
and again the more we integrate all

255
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,710
these technologies together the more

256
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:04,390
there's the opportunity to discriminate

257
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:06,400
among people we have to change we have

258
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:12,040
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our societal expectations and</font>

259
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,199
cultural norms so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me go into well</font>

260
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,020
and protocol stack clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> extends into</font>

261
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,800
social space and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

262
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,410
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we prevent patching relying</font>

263
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,870
entirely on catching because we can't

264
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">patch some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these problems we're gonna</font>

265
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to re-engineer redesign things so</font>

266
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,990
let me mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan pay</font>

267
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,840
who's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pioneers in the</font>

268
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,490
computer science field who said the best

269
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,060
way to predict the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to invent</font>

270
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,560
it he was a was or is I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

271
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,300
if he's still alive fellow of the

272
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,790
american academy of arts and sciences

273
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,449
national academy of engineering royal

274
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,319
ciebie parts etc etc and he's played a

275
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:59,430
key role at NSF in providing our

276
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:03,870
oversight for many years so our goal at

277
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:06,209
NSF is to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invent the future we</font>

278
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:10,050
say what does a government agency have

279
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,390
to do with inventing the future so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

280
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the projects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that NSF funded what I</font>

281
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,980
didn't have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this the</font>

282
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">final report the people who get NSF</font>

283
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,070
money have to submit annual reports and

284
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:25,350
final reports and the the story and it's

285
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,590
probably apocryphal is that the final

286
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:33,260
report say we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company's doing</font>

287
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:37,070

290
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,500
a lot of the inventions we take for

291
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,349
granted are in fact things that grew out

292
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,380
of NSF all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them do quite as well as</font>

293
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,769
Google but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them too and that's</font>

294
00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:03,570
our goal is to invent the future so our

295
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:07,589
goal is to invest in science this is was

296
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,540
that founded NSF established the mission

297
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,130
to promote the progress of science to

298
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,230
advance the national health prosperity

299
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> welfare and to secure the national</font>

300
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense so this is what when we look at</font>

301
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:23,160
research proposals this is our goal is

302
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to help America and the world over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

303
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,260
long term not to we're not trying to

304
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,209
build products we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

305
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,069
research that's going to enable products

306
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,810
to transform the frontiers of science

307
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">and engineering stimulate innovation</font>

308
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,089
address societal needs to research and

309
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:41,939
education and excel as a federal science

310
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,040
agency so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this translate into</font>

311
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world so how many of you are</font>

312
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,750
computer science majors or faculty or

313
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,689
things like that must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be what other</font>

314
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,620
majors are ever in here I'm sorry

315
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,700
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering okay what else</font>

316
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,089
digital forensics is that a separate for

317
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,089
partner here

318
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:05,640
okay okay what else anything outside

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science and engineering civil</font>

engineer civil engineer

321
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:16,389
so mathematics<font color="#CCCCCC"> or science is fun</font>

322
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,980
seventy-six percent of basic research in

323
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,620
the United States that's a pretty huge

324
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,319
percentage the program that I lead I

325
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,540
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percentage but it's the</font>

326
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:30,329
single biggest computer security

327
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:33,699
research program in the world we have

328
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:36,729
670 active research grants we have over

329
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,199
a thousand faculty members<font color="#CCCCCC"> in over 2,000</font>

330
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,240
graduate students<font color="#CCCCCC"> G in computer security</font>

331
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:47,500
research that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of research</font>

332
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:48,689
going on so oops so how do we do it and

333
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,189
I'm just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

334
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:54,339
about how is that makes decisions

335
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:56,110
because it's always black magic to

336
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,199
people who have never been on the inside

337
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,660
do it without these things we call

338
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,359
solicitation solicitations is a nice way

339
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,519
of saying here's a broad topic we're

340
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,550
interested in in the case of my program

341
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

342
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:15,370
to build me a widget that does this it's

343
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,889
not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you might I've heard of is</font>

344
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,660
RFPs request for proposals we give a

345
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,300
broad topic we say we're interesting

346
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,439
stuff in this area and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two get</font>

347
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,969
proposals and they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

348
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:29,349
comparable one to another because you

349
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:34,480
have an ID and someone else has an idea

350
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:37,360
is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different fifty thousand</font>

351
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,649
proposals annually of those about 900

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,699
coming to my program<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

354
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,599
transparent review process what this

355
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,569
means is we bring in peer reviews people

356
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,759
like you those newer faculty members

357
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,910
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are like you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

358
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,470
for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are students now</font>

359
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,319
doesn't not all for me not all from

360
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,759
academia people from industry as well we

361
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,880
bring those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we ask their</font>

362
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:08,140
opinions and they dress their opinions

363
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:12,169
and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> party area local signs</font>

364
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,789
appear and the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on society</font>

365
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:20,720
yeah 40,000 reviews a year of which

366
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:24,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shindo number of 500 or 600 our library</font>

367
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">alone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have review panels the existing</font>

368
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:30,289
and everything goes to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> program officer</font>

369
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,450
or program directors line so what

370
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,440
listens to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have to say and the</font>

371
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,370
size

372
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:47,659
and then we usually do with the faxes

373
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:51,000
not always about 10,000 words per year

374
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:54,149
about 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of my</font>

375
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,740
program about 75 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 million dollars a</font>

376
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,899
year out of my program about eight

377
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:04,049
billion dollars out of NSF every year

378
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:06,570
that goes into new research so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

379
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,679
tell you just a little bit about NSF and

380
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,899
cybersecurity we've been doing

381
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,149
cybersecurity research or in funding

382
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity research at NSF since</font>

383
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:22,529
about the year 2000<font color="#E5E5E5"> um when I got into</font>

384
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:25,549
cyber security in 1988 my mother asked

385
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,549
me whether there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

386
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:35,980
was it clear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little clearer now okay</font>

387
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,559
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> y2k a lot of you younger folks</font>

388
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,870
don't remember it the concern was that

389
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,120
when the clock struck January first two

390
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,549
thousand every computer in the world was

391
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,439
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop our electricity was going</font>

392
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,760
to go out the airplanes would be stopped

393
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,970
etc and they put the realities that

394
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,230
nothing happened everything was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

395
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,299
pretty much there are a few minor

396
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,640
countries why he doesn't go wrong

397
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,129
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> in government and private</font>

398
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,750
industry boat in embarked on a crash

program to solve to fix all the problems

400
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,880
before they occur we haven't done that

all sorts of rearguard actions and

403
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,980
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually something going on</font>

404
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:23,799
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the news if you read</font>

405
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,220
there's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate between should</font>

406
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:31,120
encryption be regulated to allow law

407
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,149
enforcement to catch bad guys or should

408
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,500
it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to allow companies and</font>

409
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:40,059
individuals to protect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

410
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,809
there's not a right and a wrong it's

411
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,809
waiting things

412
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,470
arm so

413
00:19:50,170 --> 00:20:01,450
over the past 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started out by</font>

414
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:08,690
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure our systems new dress</font>

415
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:11,150
policy is usability<font color="#CCCCCC"> work force etc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

416
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,920
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> UCF a scholarship for service</font>

417
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:18,590
program if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> none other</font>

418
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,179
so one of the things that for those of

419
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go on to graduate school somewhere</font>

420
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,540
else might consider is there's a

421
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,830
sinkhole scholarship for service which

422
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,629
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like ROTC from military</font>

423
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,340
scholarship for service the idea is the

424
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,490
government pays your tuition and pays

425
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,500
you money to live on and in return you

426
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">promised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you graduate you will</font>

427
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,820
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same amount of time work at</font>

428
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:45,919
least that amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time working for</font>

429
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:48,649
the government as a paid employee in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

430
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,299
cyber security job and then after you

431
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,419
met your minimum you can either stay or

432
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:55,190
leave and so that's that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of related</font>

433
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,669
to this is helping to educate the

434
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,669
workforce

435
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:10,269
so as we moved along in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we've got</font>

436
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,269
more interdisciplinary and more and more

437
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:20,179
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interested in trying to provide</font>

438
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,730
mechanisms to transition the technology

439
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,769
into practice so the biggest changes

440
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,899
over the past few years have been to

441
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:27,950
integrate the social sciences and nobody

442
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,989
mentioned that they were social

443
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,710
scientists<font color="#E5E5E5"> a psychologist and economist</font>

446
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,669
it's increasingly important i'll give

447
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,779
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of examples that over the</font>

448
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:46,549
next few slides because we have to

449
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:49,639
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these different factors</font>

450
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:53,059
it's not just technical we have to

451
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:58,580
redefine what it means to be secure so

452
00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:00,529
the scope of the taxi program secure and

453
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,809

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">psychology there's a program</font>

481
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,990

competition which is a general

485
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,960
programming competition there's also

486
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,399
cybersecurity competitions I don't know

487
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,890
if you have any of us here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at UCF you do</font>

488
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,500
CCDC right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so New York phone CCDC</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of Maryland which is a</font>

494
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:16,790
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool competition and there's a</font>

495
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care one yeah also harder</font>

496
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:22,399
security software all sorts so let me

497
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about a few things where some of</font>

498
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,990
these topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> are coming together in</font>

499
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:33,830
cyber physical systems social<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavioral</font>

500
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:36,350
and economic etc um<font color="#CCCCCC"> skip that ok</font>

501
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:42,830
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> went on to</font>

502
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:46,399
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was at a workshop at Berkeley among</font>

503
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:49,600
other things ethical hacking and and

504
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,830
what hacking means hacking means

505
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,039
changing things learning about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

506
00:24:51,830 --> 00:25:00,610
and so a lot of hacking is about just

507
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:05,360
understanding the term originated at MIT

508
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:07,580
back in the 70s<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe even the 60s so</font>

509
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,889
you have to hack things in order to

510
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,289
learn about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they work so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

511
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,059
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a few projects that we</font>

512
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:17,210
fund at NSF in some of these areas

513
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:19,760
obviously with 670 research projects I

514
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,740
can't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all of them but let me</font>

515
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,520
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few transportation related</font>

516
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:30,710
projects so how do computers fit into

517
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:35,750
transportation well there's another term

518
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:40,010
for a modern car any of you heard a car

519
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:42,890
is a networked computer that happens to

520
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,140
have wheels in an engine that's that's I

521
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,630
mean their various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to phrase it but</font>

522
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,690
think about it how many computers do you

523
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,700
think there are in a modern car and I'm

524
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,559
not talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real low end car but</font>

525
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,370
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mid-range to up range car any</font>

526
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,370
of you and ideas yet

527
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,710
I'm sorry how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't heard a</font>

528
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,480
number that high but but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe you I</font>

529
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:14,380
mean is there data to you have some

530
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:16,690
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm certainly</font>

531
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,330
not going to disagree with you it is it

532
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,710
is certainly in the hundreds what the

533
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,379
exact number is is going to depend on

534
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the specific car even your remote</font>

535
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,770
control door entry is at least one

536
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,240
computer and there's many many many

537
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:35,020
computers and they're all networked

538
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:39,580
together increasingly we're talking

539
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:42,040
about smart roads I'm moving the

540
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,949
Washington DC area we have a legendary

541
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,379
traffic people are proud of how bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

542
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,880
traffic is you show up we wait to a

543
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,530
meeting you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to explain it you</font>

544
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,760
just say traffic and everybody

545
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">understands you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to say oh</font>

546
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,970
there was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> accident here to say</font>

547
00:26:53,290 --> 00:27:01,330
traffic if the cars can communicate with

548
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:04,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other then we could keep all the</font>

549
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,610
cars moving faster because they wouldn't

550
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,920
keep hitting the brakes and accelerating

551
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,590
you can keep a steady flow and we'd get

552
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,470
a lot more cars through sounds great

553
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:18,280
what's the bad guy going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do when they</font>

554
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:22,090
have that cause cars crash into each

555
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,860
other maybe what I want to do I don't

556
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to cause cars crash into each other</font>

557
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,840
that slows everything down what I want

558
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:31,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is if I have two highways running</font>

559
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,449
parallel to each other I want to tell

560
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,270
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cars I'll call them highway a</font>

561
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,210
and highway be I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell air all</font>

562
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:43,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other cars highway a is a mess this</font>

563
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning go get on highway being and then</font>

564
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,159
I'll take highway n

565
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,928
because there's no one there that's a

566
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,870
lot more fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> than crashing cars into</font>

567
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,870
each other well maybe maybe not

568
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,139
can I do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I have impact on</font>

569
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,480
other forms of transportation trains

570
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:12,679
planes certainly they're bad things that

571
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,679
you can make happen um but there may be

572
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,780
bad weather that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cause them to</font>

573
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">raptor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> claims the long way to burn more</font>

574
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,920
fuel and cause them to be late which

575
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,799
causes passengers not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like that</font>

576
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,960
anymore sure we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a lot</font>

577
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,030
of scenarios so there's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty</font>

629
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,379
their goal was you could identify any

00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,970
vehicle it could be where a vehicle

631
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,640
could be thrown it could be a car

632
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,770
whatever and how do you build one of

633
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,669
these vehicles so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

some of it came out of hakam's so all

640
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:31,810
this stuff is connected together and so

641
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they were building cars could it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

642
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,220
hacked and you saw their little video of

that's was the most computerized car is

658
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:31,639
they upgrade their car by software

659
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,350
downloads they fix bugs with software

660
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,820
downloads and they were the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

661
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,100
that would it tell senator market what

airfield and they reprogram the brakes

673
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,980
and so that they can remotely cause the

674
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,350
brakes go on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and of course they</font>

675
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,340
only do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a closed course and the</font>

684
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:37,569

697
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,580
some of this stuff in positive ways it's

698
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:35,030
not just privacy infringing it's not

699
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just for causing your car to crash we</font>

700
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,590
can also use some of these things to

701
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,440
investigate of the underground economy

702
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:47,840
um how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> occasionally get spam</font>

703
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,130
yeah occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a lot better</font>

704
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,940
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you in a second</font>

705
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,210
why it got better a few years ago spam

706
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:01,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually an amazingly complex</font>

707
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:05,630
ecosystem and it all runs in the dark

708
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:09,590
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberspace and what it turns out</font>

709
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,920
that spam is an integrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply chain</font>

710
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:18,150
because of you

711
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:22,380
I mean when you buy a chair the chair

712
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:25,079
did come all from one place the plastic

713
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,720
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from plastic factory clock the</font>

714
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,400
clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> factory the designers had to</font>

715
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,990
design it somewhere had to be assembled

716
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">st shipped all these different things</font>

717
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,069
that all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things how all those</font>

718
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:38,040
pieces fit together is a supply chain in

719
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:40,619
just the same way now we're in things

720
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,029
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have a supply chain you have</font>

721
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,130
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to distribute the</font>

722
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:48,140
malware and the malware is going to

723
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,829
cause computers to become servers

724
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:54,598
community kind of scam generators and

725
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:57,540
someone else has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve on</font>

726

addresses to span to send Stan to to the

735
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,660
internet they have to support the

00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:36,750
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> jindo the spammers and</font>

737
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:39,240
those sorts of lowlifes have a better

738
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,430
idea support and almost any software

739
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,118
company you have they have a real

740
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,950
financial incentive to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

741
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,210
happy they are the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> people at</font>

742
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,210
customer service um

743
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:58,410
and so there's there's real hard science

744
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">far sighs there's a very cool science</font>

745
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,710
studying this sort of stuff figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

746
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:08,490
how the bad guys work on and and how

747
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,500
they how the money gets processed and

748
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:17,490
and the way well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

749
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:19,410
address this so since we are the

750
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:24,180
National Science Foundation we do have

751
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:26,720
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stan a lot of it is social</font>

752
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:34,620
sciences economics and things like that

753
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:39,089
sociology so money is the driver like

754
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:40,770
that allowing people to do things on the

755
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,470
Internet allows scaling up in a way

756
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:48,720
that's never been possible before if you

757
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:50,790
want to do pickpocketing pickpocketing

758
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,529
is pretty easy but the chances of being

759
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:56,070
caught are pretty high and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

760
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:58,320
so many pockets you can pick a day but

761
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,510
if you do it online you can automate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

762
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,570
pickpocketing and that's what's

763
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:05,310
happening it allows monetization at a

764
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:09,200
scale it's never been possible before

765
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:13,350
and so what we see is this worldwide

766
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,098
mapping so there are users in the United

767
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">States</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rising is going to the English wars in</font>

771
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:34,739
to affiliate programs in Russia

772
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks and so on with all these</font>

773
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,410
different countries and this also makes

774
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,118
an all-out partner to prosecute because

775
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,828
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just one country where you're</font>

776
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,859
going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad guys it's a</font>

777
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:56,950
worldwide thing so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is how</font>

778
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:59,500
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you break this and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

779
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,328
you break it and see if they can get the

780
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,890
store if you break it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> figuring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

781
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:05,170
the weak spot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think i have a</font>

782
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,410
sound on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can turn</font>

783
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,410
it on

784
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,250
this isn't my computer well<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually no</font>

785
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,620
it's not going to work which I didn't

786
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">put the sound card into it I mean</font>

787
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:25,529
exploited keep teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> louder</font>

788
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:45,080
no i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't sorry but let's not worry</font>

789
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,970
about it if you're interested in your

790
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,029
interesting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can look upset and</font>

791
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:56,509
savage at UC San Diego and he does a

792
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:58,580
great talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they found the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weak</font>

793
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,170
point in the spammers network which

794
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,960
turns out to be how they process credit

795
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:06,350
cards and there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a few places</font>

796
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,060
few bags the process almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

797
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:12,940
credit card transactions for all the

798
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,940
spammers in the world and then when the

799
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,770
was but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies</font>

800
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,530
saw the paper read about it did some

801
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:25,240
investigations and and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think was</font>

802
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:29,630
actually a Visa Visa credit card

803
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:33,799
oversight organization put pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

804
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:37,750
those banks to stop processing on spam

805
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,210
transactions and once that happened then

806
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,920
the amount of spam went down<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm</font>

807
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:49,270
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do skip through these next</font>

808
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">few so we're trying to do um get a</font>

809
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,759
computer scientists and Social Sciences

810
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,250
to work together but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

811
00:41:52,760 --> 00:42:00,190
about so this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is kind of</font>

812
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">fly so</font>

813
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:08,380
this part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this one did not come</font>

814
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a fun one how many of you have a</font>

815
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">little device in your car that tracks</font>

816
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,839
how fast you go you get better insurance

817
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:19,690
rates any of you do that they get

818
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,509
advertised on TV you have one you think

819
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:27,130
it's a good risk to get better insurance

820
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,170
rates I'm sorry it saves a few bucks

821
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:35,980
that's for sure yeah anyone else have

822
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:37,900
one so what this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Rutgers</font>

823
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,270
University New Jersey did is they said

824
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,460
what what this device does is it

825
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,410
captures your speed and they pointing

826
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,810
all it does is capture HD doesn't

827
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,910
capture where you go so what's the

828
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,339
privacy risk with that so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is</font>

829
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,560
they use this technology this technique

830
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:55,359
called elastic path thing they said if

831
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,980
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you started and we assume</font>

832
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you started at home and the insurance</font>

833
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,079
company knows where your home is because

834
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,359
that's where they send a bill and they

835
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,800
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how fast you went and when you</font>

836
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:07,740
started when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you stop and things like</font>

837
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,690
that can they figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where your wet</font>

838
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,430
and it turns out the short version is

839
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,980
yeah most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can figure</font>

840
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,270
out where you enter million they don't

841
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,150
know where you turn to<font color="#CCCCCC"> life when you</font>

842
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn it right in our GPS and just know</font>

843
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:24,759
how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

844
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:27,670
but because of house streets are laid

845
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:29,680
out and they know where that is they can

846
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:32,650
figure out where you win is that a

847
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,879
privacy risk well maybe not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

848
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,250
all you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is commuting back and</font>

849
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,640
forth between<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and work put if</font>

850
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,109
you're going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and then you're</font>

851
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,740
going to the bar and then you're going

852
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:48,490
to work or your mind to home and then to

853
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,868
work and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bar and to your</font>

854
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,549
girlfriend's house and then to your

855
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:58,210
boyfriend's house and then you're going

856
00:43:51,549 --> 00:44:00,460
home maybe there is a privacy so it's

857
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,970
some interesting results you know we

858
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,130
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of way how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an issue</font>

859
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,828
this is and each one of us is going to

860
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:12,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">make decisions some people and in fact</font>

861
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:14,170
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will say it's worth it how</font>

862
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of you saw the study a few years</font>

863
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:22,450
ago where they were offering candy bars

864
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:26,410
you gave her password most people you

<font color="#E5E5E5">bar you know if that's not</font>

872
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,630

verses engineering censorship so this is

883
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">a study</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that looked at how the Chinese</font>

884
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:26,620
government does censorship and what they

885

allow and what they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it turns</font>

out it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not as black and white</font>

887
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,510
as you might think there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of real</font>

888
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:36,160
intelligence to the censorship and how

892
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,040
censorship

893
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:52,920
you need yeah any other countries

894
00:45:53,490 --> 00:46:01,950
throttling certainly counts Xfinity here

895
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:06,070
in the US yeah any others<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia India</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Iran okay okay I want to challenge you</font>

897
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:13,030
how about a western country a democratic

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US as well</font>

901
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:27,490
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening and we can</font>

902
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:29,910
measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact is it the right thing</font>

903
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,680
to do with the wrong thing to do well

904
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:36,100
you hear the director of the FBI saying

905
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:40,180
we shouldn't have tour because tour is

906
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:44,200
used primarily for child porn I don't

907
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:47,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's actually true but it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

908
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,480
form of censorship do we want that form

909
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,520
of censorship that's a policy decision

910
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,800
you can have we need to understand the

911
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,870
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows it and the time</font>

912
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,870
and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will respond to that</font>

913
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:01,390
technology we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> observe large-scale</font>

914
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:04,049
internet outages these happen

915
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,049
periodically

916
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,339
and so this monitor of all places the

917
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:15,150
school called Kyra at University of

918
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:16,920
California San Diego that has sensors

919
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,800
are basically

920
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,440
things retro actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see</font>

921
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,790
really interesting results after we find

922
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,860
out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks then we retracted into</font>

923
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:31,130
if he had only known to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look we could</font>

924
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:34,170
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it happening six months ago</font>

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:36,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up karate is the Libyan Alex</font>

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:42,390
during the during the regular there

<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a Syrian haven't recently but</font>

928
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,629
there been a number of these where we're

929
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:49,650
a country just sort of drops off the

930
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:53,700
internet suddenly I want to talk about

931
00:47:49,650 --> 00:48:02,010
medical devices there's not an awful lot

932
00:47:53,700 --> 00:48:03,629
of this so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did mention okay so if</font>

933
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:07,920
I mentioned the thing about the dick

934
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:11,610
cheney<font color="#CCCCCC"> so interesting was this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

935
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of life imitating art imitating science</font>

936
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:18,810
so it originated with the science the

937
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kevin foo and his team at the University</font>

938
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,700
of Massachusetts Amherst showed you the

00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,259
Houma and TV show picked it up and

941
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,870
turned in

942
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:35,140
aliment and then dick cheney or white

943
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:37,779
house picked it up and they thought was

944
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,549
flirty thing but actually he was TV

945
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,140
thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents origins of science</font>

946
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,570
which is kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because TV</font>

947
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't usually quite and reality aren't</font>

948
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:49,830
quite so much based on science so what

949
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:53,350
they had done was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual look of</font>

950
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:56,140
pacemakers and measure whether you could

<font color="#CCCCCC">love today I wonder crack was an</font>

occasional authorized person here is

953
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:06,029
proper software programmer what sort of

954
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,029
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be due to my comb</font>

955
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,590
earlier this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said he has the</font>

956
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,560
largest collection of pacemakers in the

957
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,390
world in his lab and they measure all

958
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,420
sorts of stuff one of the hard things

959
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:22,240
about measuring the security risks of a

960
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,580
pacemaker is you have to compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

961
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,520
how it behaves inside the human body and

962
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:30,009
they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like they were</font>

963
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,440
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pacemakers inside a bag of</font>

964
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,070
hamburger meat and things like that and

965
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,570
how to measure the attenuating

966
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,800
influences of the human body and it

967
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:43,630
turns out when they finally got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance</font>

968
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:46,180
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people who are doctors and do</font>

969
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:48,640
research in the physical aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

970
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,620
actually a scientific standard for for

971
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:59,950
what you use and it's not hamburger meat

972
00:49:50,620 --> 00:50:01,540
but so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started saw</font>

973
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:06,379
that I had a couple copies of control

974
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:10,490
wall attack here this is a card game

975
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:13,010
our product had high school students

976
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:16,879
interested in the security field and

977
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:19,430
understanding what what it means to work

978
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,020
in the security field two copies of the

979
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,799
game here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will give them to the</font>

980
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:29,090
two people who asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it first you</font>

981
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,890
get one when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the other and if</font>

982
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,320
you're really interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the special</font>

983
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,960
if you're a faculty member send me an

984
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,520
email and I can get you one I don't have

985
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,170
a lot of them i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i don't have</font>

986
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,810
hundreds of them giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> away about a</font>

987
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,640
thousand but i do have a few more and i

988
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:49,690
encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play these and show</font>

989
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:55,640
them to high school she fractured flag

990
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:58,160
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually running I think this</font>

991
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,330
week because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font>

992
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,950
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at the meeting I was out</font>

993
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,799
at Berkeley wasn't there he was running

994
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,710
running this program so i neva know

995
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,120
anybody played well who knows what a

996
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,250
capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flag day means insecure to</font>

997
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,500
help it so about half of you so the idea

998
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">is there's a computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

999
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,870
some data on it or or a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1000
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:21,230
whatever and the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in and</font>

1001
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:23,150
and get that data and show that you've

1002
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">got and some of them you can attack</font>

1003
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,890
other people and steal the data back and

1004
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some you can attack others if</font>

1005
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,600
there's all sorts of variations

1006
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,810
dr. Isaacs yeah maybe running this for

1007
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:42,110
about 10 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's a fun thing it's</font>

1008
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:44,290
a trendy thing there are some nurse to

1009
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,750
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things here</font>

1010
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:49,759
people have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think</font>

1011
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:53,570
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do i also have</font>

1012
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,640
a problem with it a lot of these sorts

1013
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:59,210
of games tend to turn things very macho

1014
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:02,870
and when you turn things really macho it

1015
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:05,840
has a tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discourage female</font>

1016
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:08,839
participants and we have a real shortage

1017
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,550
in this field of female participants

1018
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:15,110
we're losing half of our potential

1019
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:18,590
scientists and so I have a real problem

1020
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:20,770
with with anything that further reduces

1021
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:23,810
that so I'm really ambivalent about it

1022
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:26,810
but there are a lot of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1023
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,160
who like them and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people learn</font>

1024
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,690
a lot but it's something just sort of

1025
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,549
keep in mind if you're thinking of

1026
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,800
inventing one is how do you invent

1027
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,710
something like this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

1028
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:43,700
off participants it doesn't turn into a

1029
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:45,020
macho via so me so I have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

1030
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,560

vast majority of them do go to academics

1035

encourage it but it's not prohibited so

1042

if you got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and it's a really</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">University um they pretty much set the</font>

weather their faculty own it who they

00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,290
license it to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really get</font>

1085
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,880
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that because it's funded</font>

1086
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:10,529
with government money the government

1087
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,580
ends up with what's called government

1088
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:17,940
purpose rights which means we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use it</font>

1089
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:20,100
ourselves but that practically doesn't

1090
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,390
have any impact for research because the

1091
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,950
research isn't far enough along

1092
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:27,089
government doesn't want to buy research

1093
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:29,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">he wants to buy products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it</font>

1094
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:33,570
doesn't have any practical<font color="#CCCCCC"> text so we</font>

1095
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:37,260
sort of punt and leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up to the to</font>

1096
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:41,340
the universities to figure out we do in

1097
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:43,020
some cases have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> strangers</font>

1098
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:45,780
associated with our research like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1099
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,910
have a transition to practice option in

1100
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,830
my program and if you take money from

1101
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:53,549
that you have to agree to make any

1102
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:56,880
software open source but that's that's

1103
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the case for most awards that's</font>

1104
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,560
that's just for an actor

1105
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:05,190
area so it's a good question it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we</font>

1106
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,570
largely prime time hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else no</font>

1107
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:10,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's another top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command somewhere</font>

1108
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:10,490
else thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your time</font>
