1
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:32,800
all right good morning sir so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking today about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we serve</font>

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,800
our boxing resource management anyone to

4
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,780
back you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're good awesome</font>

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so my name is Vikram i'm a</font>

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,190
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also work in the barn</font>

7
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,230
dramatics live right upstairs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do a</font>

8
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,940
lot of tech stuff and this was our

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,190
research they got funded by the National

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,959
Science Foundation on doing some crazy

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,640
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually surprised at</font>

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,589
how sane so the research focuses on

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,120
decentralized resource management so you

14
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:03,339
know on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of laptops and</font>

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,740
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> TF but as you see the whole</font>

16
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,900
control all belief<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to task manager</font>

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,449
you see resource management we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,820
to apply something like that to a much

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,700
broader context where we can see what's

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on where devices that are not</font>

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,590
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one another in the same</font>

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:24,640
physical place<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications</font>

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,680
are but I people to start off<font color="#CCCCCC"> by saying</font>

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,940
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to John and Jeff for like having</font>

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,680
me around and the awkward program yup

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,820
we're actually gonna just really really

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,860
teaches you how to commercialize

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,789
research so that just ended yesterday

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:42,980
that was a good 10 11 weeks of solid

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:47,510
colors it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy obviously not</font>

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,030
visa for having duck here so let's see

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,840
so here's how the talk is structured

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,090
initially but is that watching and if I

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,040
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here these are going to short I</font>

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,550
don't want to spend too much time on

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,560
them is the opportunities in bak chair

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,090
and that's not just opportunities for

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,920
technology lets opportunities for

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,259
application and commercialization half

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,530
the girls after that I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> launch</font>

41
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">an application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start and finally the my</font>

42
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,810
contribution they depended logical

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,270
access units<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

44
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,620
make a point here but what I'm not going

45
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,710
to cover this probably more productive

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,600
because bitcoin is way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you brah I'm</font>

47
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,690
not gonna cover my name I can get a

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,890
whole talk on mining but I chose not to

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,750
you know my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very kind of</font>

50
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,420
exhaustive day and I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,210
cover kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a whole trip to political</font>

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,660
landscape of at all that it's very

53
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,780
heated and unproductive and finally I'm

54
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,090
not going to cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the really</font>

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,550
technical aspects like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking's what goes on at that time how</font>

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,610
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pick the longest elective chain</font>

58
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,890
I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover those topics cuz</font>

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,000
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting very kind of</font>

60
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">technically this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything is going</font>

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get there too but in kind of</font>

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,520
difference low so what do I want you

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,140
guys to kind of kick out of this no

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,220
that's kind of why I chose this time so

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,980
there are kind of three main takeaways

66
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are one and probably the most</font>

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,220
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is that the corn may or</font>

68
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,800
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 60 70 years down</font>

69
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,300
the line philomena the CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ever know</font>

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,280
he likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say build companies that</font>

71
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,600
last 100 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so can you build a</font>

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,700
product company that last that long

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin may or may not be around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,739
blockchain will definitely by far be

75
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,780
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of subtle she's funny</font>

76
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,880
seeing what will make the soy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

77
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,890
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get into that in a</font>

78
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,570
quick moment um the secondly so in early

79
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:48,260
1900's there was a guy he broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

80
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> win so naturally right embracing</font>

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,649
life and there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I didn't</font>

82
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,000
get interested today<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked like you know</font>

83
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,709
why did you break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bank is that</font>

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty miracle money</font>

85
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,990
right so you go where the money is and

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,390
investors right now are looking really

87
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,830
really really carefully I mean I'm

88
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,208
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about big firms like inducing</font>

89
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Horowitz who will throw a library a</font>

90
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,910
couple of hundred thousand like<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

91
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">five hundred thousand six hundred</font>

92
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,560
thousand and seed money to dust into

93
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin and block chain based artist and</font>

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,399
I'll talk about that environment in a

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,450
moment kind of weird you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> believing</font>

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">that between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the</font>

97
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,969
importance of the talk and so on and so

98
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,890
lastly the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

99
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,790
about is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the logical units</font>

100
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,680
so um if you guys know the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner I</font>

101
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,600
see research is<font color="#CCCCCC"> constructions in</font>

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">architecture for the processors the way</font>

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,160
they started off ages ago was those

104
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,320
vacuum tubes itself in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vacuum tubes</font>

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,220
one of the things they could do was very

106
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,310
basic but definitive logical operations

107
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,440
so in a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to the roots</font>

108
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,720
are computing I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my research</font>

109
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,640
mostly focused on how can we do the same

110
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,150
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was done ages ago with vacuum</font>

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,860
tubes bring me to the blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

112
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get started</font>

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:07,719
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the deep option huh as you</font>

114
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:10,869
guys already marvelous<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin has a</font>

115
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:12,520
public letter public ledger public

116
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:14,559
registrar anything it's called a block

117
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,909
chaining basically the public record at

118
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:19,209
all the transactions that are taking

119
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:21,959
place over the time it does a few things

120
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,879
very very very well and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those is</font>

121
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,879
verification so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people graphics</font>

122
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,909
schemes focus on the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being able</font>

123
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,819
to verify one one thing works at another

124
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:36,759
XO public and private keys in PGP kind

125
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,009
of follow that um blockchain it doesn't

126
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,039
do PGP per se but a lot of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

127
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,509
ideas per se still translate over which

128
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,459
is you have a lot of nodes that

129
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,110
independently verify transactions and

130
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,759
that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

131
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,909
hitting a huge advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

132
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,559
blockchain over so you can't do what's

133
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,839
called double spin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

134
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:57,339
shortly because I that's a kind of a

135
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical part of what I'm going to talk</font>

136
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:04,719
about any bit um watch it is so is

137
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,809
nothing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a recording tool and</font>

138
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,159
that's my angle you know kind of my

139
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:13,319
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the restore exterior the</font>

140
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,319
picture you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here kind of really</font>

141
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,640
more than box really strung together in

142
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,740
a sequential order so one going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

144
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,130
one after and they're done in a very

145
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,240
much manage so let me click any block

146
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,980
and I can verify up and that I can

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,040
verify which one which kinds actually

148
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,050
happened on and this has allowed in the

149
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,390
Bitcoin blockchain kind of stores

150
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,670
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to imagine it gets very very</font>

151
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,159
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good in every to be here that's</font>

152
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,080
accessing here needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all of it</font>

153
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,450
downloaded you're talking about almost

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">gigabytes of data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build up but you know</font>

155
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,909
there's especially in Bitcoin there's

156
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,260
other pick up mike wallace so like

157
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,970
electronic i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of a kind</font>

158
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,140
of like a man named now which is a light

159
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,660
wallet so it doesn't actually require

160
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,669
the entire block chain requires some n

161
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,320
number of operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do on</font>

162
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the blocks and like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verified uh I'm</font>

163
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,340
a big delivery came on the original

164
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,340
units philosophies that came out

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,009
one very very popular kind and the idea

166
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that you make one tool that does one</font>

167
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,780
thing right that's it so if you're kind

168
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,460
of like on mailing lists and stuff your

169
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,650
problem using and he may look like like

170
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,479
much it does one thing and it allows you

171
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,698
to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> email but my god it's so</font>

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,930
expensive there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many options so</font>

173
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,090
many things you can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

174
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,610
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something really really well</font>

175
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,090
only because it is true to that original

176
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,909
philosophy which is one tool at one time

177
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,008
um eventually we want to do is you want

178
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,509
to string them together so one tool does

179
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,330
one thing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put it another one</font>

180
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,800
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> proc map so folders another one</font>

181
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,270
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the mail sorter and you've got</font>

182
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pretty nice million system then you</font>

183
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,150
can use with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those conectes up</font>

184
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,448
going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the launch in it I try to</font>

185
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,150
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you give kind of one</font>

186
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,039
tool one job right kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> functionality</font>

187
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a blockchain it's difficult we could</font>

188
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,639
watch changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of things but like</font>

189
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,440
if you kind of go back even if you strip

190
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,259
away everything that's not essential the

191
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,779
block chain in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end gives you a tool</font>

192
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:24,659
to record and that's kind of cool power

193
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:27,029
a feature more than power<font color="#CCCCCC"> w exploit this</font>

194
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,699
takes us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada core idea can admire</font>

195
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:32,760
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just I tried to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

196
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:36,510
that could we use the blockchain to

197
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,120
record events on you speedily and so the

198
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,399
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have transactions</font>

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,899
see the advantages if there's money

200
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,329
involved people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to do that</font>

201
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product you can just inherent you</font>

202
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,390
cannot bank on that because if there's

203
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,729
money involved there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

204
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are capitalizing on it as a result</font>

205
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to</font>

206
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">tools that are more reliable so we can</font>

207
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,410
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well I can use up to my right I</font>

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,850
can I can kind of blindly<font color="#E5E5E5"> revise the</font>

209
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">blockchain to be one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing right and</font>

210
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,319
that's undisputedly tell me which events

211
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,610
are happening and by the address been a

212
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:11,699
transaction I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the more</font>

213
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:14,610
generalized assumptions later on um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in neutral or 14 but I'll vary due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

215
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,230
mixing something so one thing that's

216
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,389
really really really powerful what the

217
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,310
block chain is error correction so when

218
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,290
it transaction happens the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interactive</font>

219
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you kind of run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

220
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">unsorted entries and make sure is</font>

221
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,060
anything not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful if they are</font>

222
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,649
you will say no this is already expect

223
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,479
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have hundred bucks a nice</font>

224
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,430
counter and then before the tins

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,759
actually can i get to clarify i spend up

226
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,680
again because you can do that and the

227
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,449
budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no like you'll be</font>

228
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,189
spending money you're done you're

229
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,310
spending an extra hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

230
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:53,969
a basic idea of the double spending

231
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:56,250
power we're all that actually and it's

232
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,800
actually airport to in the broader sense

233
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,600
where it will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of build</font>

234
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,240
applications on top and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

235
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,399
weird

236
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,060
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> correct the part of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason the</font>

237
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,380
answer liked our idea was just because

238
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,589
we were doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this that</font>

239
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,950
hasn't kind of been done before oh so

240
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,529
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> going back to UM algorithms data</font>

241
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,330
structures per se you can view the

242
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,890
blockchain if you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the awana</font>

243
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,279
just mentioned earlier which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font>

244
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,529
idea one to one job<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here you have a</font>

245
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,750
recording tool so you can kind of view

246
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,939
this recording as a data structure I'm

247
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,980
very complicated one but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silla data</font>

248
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,480
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can record things in a</font>

249
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,520
way that you want once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

250
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,959
kind of mindset what you can do is you

251
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,689
take an instructor and you can kind of

252
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,149
build layers upon layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application</font>

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,890
and an even access level applications

254
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:49,660
all that I ask the person that can you

255
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,939
take transactions which is what

256
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,540
generally happens on the Bitcoin

257
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,089
blockchain can you generalize that two

258
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,439
events so transaction documents but it

259
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,290
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me more general they're not</font>

those ideas over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent by your</font>

roughly give or<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on on this idea so</font>

281
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,120
let me take a step back and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

282
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,890
blogging for watching why why is this

even there you know why do we just need

284
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,689
to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up inside internet money myself</font>

285
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,550
near email if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at gmail now it's</font>

286
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,530
got a little doll but my father you can

287
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,120
send money to each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

288
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,800
to know how to affect it they have

289
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,770
worked or not but you know what I do

290
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,329
that whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> there-there things that</font>

291
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,590
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> debauchery is coming that was</font>

292
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,320
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the three Byzantine</font>

293
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:20,640
problem it's the picture shows very

294
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,340
narrow dinner one general for two and

295
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,340
three other sources vary so

296
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:34,180
the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service team</font>

297
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,259
appears next one but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

298
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,870
generals we're going to attack a

299
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,220
territory the problem is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't trust</font>

300
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,750
what I generals because<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitors are</font>

301
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,939
pretty so he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send it</font>

302
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,610
corrupted message or take message to one

303
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,829
of the girls go attack and the enemies

304
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,470
already you prepare for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target he's</font>

305
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,149
crushed so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still do the</font>

306
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,060
whole passing the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> across from</font>

307
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,949
each other and remove the trust that is

308
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,290
kind of what so fundamentally important

309
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,399
up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin the reason you could</font>

310
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,620
experimental different from the

311
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,500
currencies like you know fear is that

312
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,600
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no inherent need for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

313
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally in hand until the block in</font>

314
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,949
a manner that like almost zero trust is

315
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,980
required in the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process because</font>

316
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:17,620
you can get public birthday so it solves

317
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,420
the core problem in the basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">generals which is it doesn't matter</font>

321
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,719
a lot of public<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes are identifying</font>

322
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:30,370
which messages are wrong in kind of mix

323
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,709
and match that this was kind of probably

324
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the biggest problems this has</font>

325
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,638
been an open problem for about 30-40

326
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,990
years before so till she came around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

327
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,449
put the tools together to solve it

328
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,550
that's kind of why this is his huge

329
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:45,910
legacy going back to a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

330
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,810
history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why so half this has been</font>

331
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:53,660
around actually

332
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:55,160
19 496 when these order<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haff factors</font>

333
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,219
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to kind of work with a</font>

334
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">standby then came the idea of proof of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">work that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also part of Hashcash</font>

336
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,060
which is also again for sparing out

337
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,070
lastly there is a teacher knows it was a

338
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">very open no no problem in distributing</font>

339
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,610
message passing so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

340
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,219
team verticals or you can pass messages

341
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,380
from one class to another on a processor

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,890
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not something like completely</font>

345

350
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,950
I'll talk about in da<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy a really</font>

cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas but initially we all had kind</font>

of been the work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> designing they've</font>

353
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,600
been around 94 96 and then eventually

354
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,400
reach out of one these were all very

355
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> known believers that's what makes</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relation</font>

359
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,520
decentralized consensus and that's the

360
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,160
idea of having independent verifiable

361
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,730
notes which can connect and verified one

community yes but these nodes can

364
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,080
obviously taking some time verify all

is trying to be currency because the

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,960
reason believe there's but there's a lot

371
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy but one of the fundamental reasons</font>

372
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,010
we need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because there needs to</font>

be acceptable authority that can be

dispute in case transactions go wrong

375
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,490
but while very generalized but it's one

376
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the reasons we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them the block</font>

384
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,240
very sluggish that came out of this

385
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is a whole idea of Bitcoin to</font>

386
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,730
point where you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be</font>

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,890
money anymore you're stronger

transferred assets and in these assets

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about those assets kind of</font>

390
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,930
are at least now in like another 25 /

391
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,440
here but that's a very very part time

392
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,650
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like 30 years ago 20</font>

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,260
years ago you could not ever think about

394
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,870
transferring money from one place to

395
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,280
another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having it done in you</font>

396
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,050
know five minutes what is it the

397
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,740
transaction verification times about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

minutes 5 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 maybe yeah so you</font>

399
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:41,330
couldn't have it generac it in that time

400
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:45,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">period especially it being verified and</font>

401
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,360
made a bell so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just learning</font>

initially learn a mushroom told me this

405
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">is never gonna work I'm not gonna buy</font>

406
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,130
this that was good like I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

407
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,010
thousand or five big<font color="#E5E5E5"> points for ten</font>

408
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,470
bucks or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> super cheap and I</font>

409
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:08,359
regret that I would probably be hella me

410
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:10,430
right now not good so my friends told me

411
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,629
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about if there's a kinase and</font>

412
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,660
remote village in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has</font>

413
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,390
internet access they have like a an ATM

414
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,010
to record their kind of common now

415
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,420
camera from what I've here but you can

416
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,520
transfer money that kind of almost

417
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,110
instantaneously 5-10 minutes the other

418
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,440
person in that kind of a remote place

419
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,449
has that money taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> step further when</font>

420
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,250
you transfer assets now you're talking

421
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:37,670
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parachute wow you</font>

422
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:44,860
know gets up gets us excited um kind of

423
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:47,990
going to the further tell the

424
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,830
interfacing hub so started thinking

425
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,230
about the blockchain as as confident

426
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,779
to which multiple devices connect right

427
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,390
so you have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sits</font>

428
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:01,299
somewhere virtually and millions of

429
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,250
devices interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in keep in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

430
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,658
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited to just computers I could</font>

431
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,669
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in a block chain transfer</font>

432
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:10,090
money from my laptop I can do it from my

433
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:11,980
phone that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the best things</font>

434
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,678
are you can charge money<font color="#E5E5E5"> very off your</font>

435
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,299
phone to the box shape so millions of

436
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,970
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are connected and the</font>

437
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:22,750
block she kind of evolves from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font>

438
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:26,799
idea of just the way to transfer money

439
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:29,080
to avoid to interface device it's very

440
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,090
very tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

441
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,490
in the room kind of make a living doing

442
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,139
this is connecting like pink their

443
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,570
features i have online desktop at home

444
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:39,580
to this laptop and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to this</font>

445
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,230
device it's inherently tough doing that

446
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,699
right so enjoyed you can transfer step

447
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:51,549
off your<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocker to the android for a</font>

448
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty easily anybody yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so dog</font>

449
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,490
chain is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving in that</font>

450
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,059
direction now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font>

451
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,129
really use you

452
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,408
the features are they already built into

453
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget right so I'm not making</font>

454
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:04,919
anything to connect my laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

455
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,539
block chain or connect my wallet to the

456
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,120
block chain the ladders allow the

457
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,230
interface that what has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been done is</font>

458
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,600
kind of take it to the next level

459
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,549
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well can we take the</font>

460
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,168
interfacing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep invalid if the</font>

461
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,139
devices are connected can be kind of

462
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,669
push to next one we're so devices to

463
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,379
block chain to be chemical to reverse

464
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,370
that if you could do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

465
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:27,570
we're looking at something quite

466
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,459
powerful um seamless integration is

467
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,439
having a huge deal lately especially

468
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,899
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzz words between to another</font>

469
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,399
place you can get everywhere millions

470
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">and millions of dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in imported by</font>

471
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:40,350
companies like Heidi and so on what is

472
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">it coming back we don't know to to about</font>

473
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,178
this game so the whole kind of funding

474
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,399
cycle takes about eight to ten years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

475
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:51,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten your report card Katy Gallagher all</font>

476
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:53,969
the money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> irt bigger garbage</font>

477
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,649
another huge buzz word intended you can

478
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,869
evaluate how well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform below</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

479
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:00,029
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm a you know last time that</font>

480
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:01,709
happened we just was called plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

481
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:05,340
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us kind of money money</font>

482
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,929
nothing about huge successor but we hope

483
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:12,049
that doesn't happen here because I

484
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably custom outdoors oh yes so</font>

485
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,820
mobile also be a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> solar has one</font>

486
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,908
I think

487
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,700
whether all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> coins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also have mobile</font>

488
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:24,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">odds mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locks kind of first started</font>

489
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,799
taking a step further where you can do

490
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,570
the whole seamless integration so very

491
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">briefly and I'll come back to this my</font>

492
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,649
research focused on how to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

493
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:36,320
enterprise-level cloud for a blockchain

494
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,029
that an organization can use amongst

495
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,549
themselves to create a whole internet

496
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,559
stays sober relying on just deploying

497
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:44,330
kind of a cloud container with the block

498
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,190
chain and you can interface back and

499
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:51,049
forth for a lot of devices so moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

500
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,590
from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to kind of take a</font>

501
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,820
short detour of why do we really you

502
00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:03,309
know really care and we're really

503
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">excited about Bitcoin this is a brief am</font>

504
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:11,480
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can see of the virtual</font>

505
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:15,019

about 45 million minute and only 15

507
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,120
deals so that means venture cap match

511
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,379
that just think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much what each</font>

512
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,539
deal does it huge sum of money that

513
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:35,029
they've got coindesk one of the plumbing

514
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,529
best like sort of recordings and stuff

515
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,149
they got a huge chunk of money from

516

inducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're actually only</font>

basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is going to become a</font>

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,330
occurrences in he'll take basically

stream data off kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a decentralized</font>

535
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,129
I could have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

536
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,380
of your you have documents basically

537
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">file storage tanks but it also allows</font>

538
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,990
music streaming videos and all that and

539
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,970
it does everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've had it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look the</font>

540
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,320
blockchain idea and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about why</font>

541
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,740
do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this to block chain</font>

542
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,810
manager supervisor so what kind of gives

543
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you advice what are the basic reasons</font>

544
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,129
you can do that is because it allows for

545
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,409
smart contracts and that's been a huge

546
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,420
huge deal that we took advantage of as

547
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:01,380
well smart contracts basically allowing

548
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,270
to do to kind of automate a task so if

549
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,580
you use an application called if this

550
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,889
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's kind of a shame on you</font>

551
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:12,689
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart contract that executes at one</font>

552
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:15,290
time doing one thing I hear the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum of</font>

553
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asset I was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier on</font>

554
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:21,840
what is the Star Trek so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of kind</font>

555
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,159
of companies are starting off it may or

556
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,090
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bad tactic but they're kind</font>

557
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,640
of started off with an idea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

558
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,050
huge you know made strides in this

559
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,300
direction where they've started off

560
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,889
selling a couple of million worth of a

561
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,470
turning point and obviously they're

562
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,510
doing some really amazing things so

563
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,690
kudos to them but a lot of competition

564
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:46,320
sorry most stars of the currency is uh

565
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:50,340
is one of them and lastly

566
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,539

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about so this is</font>

607
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,600
something Satoshi had considered if you

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,610
look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email archives but I Tyrion</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">complete bust</font>

613

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,990
is is the way products especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

against the traditional thinking he's

626

like no I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to incorporate blood</font>

628
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,550
basically means is you have logical

629
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,160
access to the blockchain so you can

630
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:10,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually create a program like a skirt</font>

631
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,650
that runs whatever you actually the

632
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">script on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blockchain so using the</font>

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,940
blocks the transaction the transaction

634
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,680
entities as a function can you create a

635
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,360
strip that integrates<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in a</font>

636
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,220
meaningful way to do something and

637
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,229
that's the whole idea of smart contracts

638
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,480
where you can integrate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocks to</font>

639
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,220
integrate transactions place of origin

all those kind of things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Creator</font>

641
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,510
like a really cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> new smart contract</font>

642
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,240
that uniquely identifies you as the

643
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,980
person pushing the contract or culture

644
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the contract</font>

645
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,510
then getting a service as a result of

646
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,880
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really poor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea the reason</font>

647
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,919
Satoshi didn't consider was because this

648
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,630
was not scriptural everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally</font>

649
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,669
done server security you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

650
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,020
like when it is stripped<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in and</font>

651
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you don't want to</font>

652
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,668
do I mean you're looking at like a lot

653
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,980
of crappy gotta clean up afterwards so

654
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,049
totally did not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even touch this</font>

655
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,790
topic simply because I'm talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

656
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,080
blocked you to get too bloated and more

657
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,940
importantly the blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have</font>

658
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,879
too many issues it would get sluggish

659
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,679
with it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just sluggish it is</font>

660
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,840
security issues come up which are huge

661
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good job it</font>

662
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,649
actually more secure that HIPAA which is

663
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,090
the compliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like medical records</font>

664
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,650
which is kind of awesome and this is

665
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,168
open source and hit but require you did

666
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,620
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bucks I don't know huge</font>

667
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,120
interconnect can overhead out<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs but</font>

668
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,830
this will actually open up kind of a

669
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,989
whole endorse box that you don't

670
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,659
necessarily what because<font color="#CCCCCC"> skip something</font>

671
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,260
everywhere running<font color="#CCCCCC"> walls but definitely</font>

672
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,260
no no

673
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:44,139
these are two Swan started what was

674
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,760
absolutely incredible which incorrectly

675
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,010
so companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing money do</font>

676
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,750
something where they give up part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

677
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,010
their company so in the hope that their

678
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,470
company will be part of millions of

679
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they say to an investor here</font>

680
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,450
take ten percent of our company and give

681
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,670
us a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

682
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,860
start building this company right smart

683
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that to</font>

684
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,330
cryptocurrencies so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kickstarter when</font>

685
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,220
you give someone money all you're

686
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,110
getting ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy a ball in return</font>

687
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,700
now you're actually maybe still hungry

688
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,260
so if your company becomes a

689
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,660
multi-billion dollar company one day

690
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,129
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a decentralized</font>

691
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,660
if you invest it in that time

692
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,710
interestingly if you follow the Kendrick

693
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,410
White House<font color="#CCCCCC"> landscape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on</font>

694
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,600
there the jobs are I kept asking 2012 is

695
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,179
going to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to do that with</font>

696
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,879
fear and we are like incredibly excited

697
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,530
because I think in the second quarter of

698
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">2015 you might announce like what's</font>

699
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come out so people would kind</font>

of certain income level and level<font color="#E5E5E5"> acid</font>

equity and the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea being Jobs Act</font>

703
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,510
was kind of put startups back on the

scene<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of either bring them up w</font>

did not get it but only<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seven teams</font>

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,700
out of 200 something got the customer

710
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:09,130
all so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too surprised but their</font>

711
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,510
proposal when all their transition to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

712
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">research by contributions to the work</font>

713
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,870
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on postal open up of</font>

714
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:18,809
things they wanted to create the whole

715
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,969
Internet of Things idea and then when

716
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:23,950
people to work on protocols we were one

717
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:28,420
of the only proposals that are talking

718
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:32,880
about a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud up</font>

719
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and here I'm going to go a little slow</font>

720
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,160
but the whole idea behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

721
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:44,889
different logical access is that you can

722
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:46,300
do a set of things right and you need

723
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,220
them so like that like you can in

724
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,490
tomorrow another side here but i'll

725
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,620
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you basically you're you're</font>

726
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,940
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of properties that are</font>

727
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:00,250
inherent to a data structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin as</font>

728
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,440
a recruiting tool does one thing very

729
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,720
very well it will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you double</font>

730
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending and the whole idea is with</font>

731
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,670
double spending if i have x amount of

732
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,860
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spend X amount of oil in the</font>

733
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,200
time that is being verified I can use a

734
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:17,629
specially crafted let you know script or

735
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,340
code to spend a hundred hours a day

736
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,990
because they haven't been verified so

737
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've really haven't been taken out of</font>

738
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,180
my account so to speak but if I spend

739
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,250
them again so you know I sent twice as

740
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:30,200
double spending the block chain will

741
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,390
reject the second transaction because it

742
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,140
can figure out that like that it's not

743
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:38,360
working my proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was well why don't</font>

744
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take advantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this why don't we</font>

745
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,620
force a connected device to double<font color="#E5E5E5"> span</font>

746
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,429
which we know is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get rejected</font>

747
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and use that as a basis to do yes or no</font>

748
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:54,260
operations so I'm streaming a video all

749
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:57,409
right and I have paper access which is

750
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,840
not painful to you for four minutes I'm

751
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like my smart contracts</font>

752
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,060
that my money is going to keep going

753
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">down when 12 minutes you going on but I</font>

754
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,240
indication that much the mighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> muscles</font>

755
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna say okay here amor well I don't</font>

756
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any more money but we're going to</font>

757
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,330
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> her to spend money in there we do</font>

758
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,040
that because this kind of simplify the

759
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,080
development side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font>

760
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,870
something that you know for a fact that

761
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">blockchains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna turn in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their contract</font>

762
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:27,590
it is the function identify the yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

763
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,990
no answers that you can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

764
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,159
this resort like this is kind of your

765
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,530
distinct money you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

766
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">resourced so i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t show you in the</font>

767
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,670
next 12 minutes or next whatever setting

768
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,260
we took advantage of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i try to build</font>

769
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,060
an enterprise cloud out there and i'll

770
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,980
walk into in a walk you guys through

771
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:49,049
that so the approach

772
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,880
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear across is that the way</font>

773
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,610
this can accept the way I approached it

774
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,790
if you find problems that are resolved

775
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,100
and use them as a basis to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

776
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,780
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> so going back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the whole out</font>

777
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,178
of unity<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say instruction set</font>

778
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,799
architecture you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a few cable you</font>

779
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,169
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well which is add</font>

780
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,720
subtract divide X or and all those

781
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:12,540
logical gate functions you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a very</font>

782
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,160
small set of time to think about keeping

783
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,480
them but it could be them variable and

784
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,220
you know that the answer is always going

785
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be flogged the probably the block she</font>

786
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,390
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you're afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the answer</font>

787
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,620
might not be reliable if you use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

788
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,150
do something kind of enterprise grade

789
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,918
right it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work out the way you</font>

790
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,900
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so you want to run other</font>

791
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,350
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of work</font>

792
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,750
out very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> never spending we know</font>

793
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,309
it's going to always give us enough no

794
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter what question I put if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I double</font>

795
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,360
spin in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that question I'm</font>

796
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,340
always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a no as an answer so</font>

797
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,559
we use that as a basis to build logical

798
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,970
operations on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> T so if I know I'm</font>

799
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,770
always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it no can I forget</font>

800
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,720
the question such that the question is

801
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,809
meaningful so then the no extra means

802
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,380
something in terms of my application so

803
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:58,500
we're screaming no

804
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,090
that doesn't make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense right your</font>

805
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:07,150
screen forever but you asked the

806
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:09,159
question is my contractor update your

807
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,610
monday babies running out by the time

808
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">you kick in and you start to pee but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

809
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really have the money for well you</font>

810
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:20,230
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to terminate so basically</font>

811
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,360
you can kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> an upper limit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

812
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,970
you can never<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cross using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

813
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,399
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> in offer but why that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

814
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,490
matters down the line here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bitcoin</font>

815
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,290
applications time in five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

816
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,360
is kind of going to be what will be

817
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,909
happening out of most good coin startup

818
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,310
companies because the whole idea of a

819
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,050
full stack startup is that you don't

820
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,060
just go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> powder when you build the</font>

821
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,700
services around the product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that give up</font>

822
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,159
experience the move the way for the

823
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,800
future is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concept of</font>

824
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,140
experience experience economies where

825
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:57,850
people are actually paying for the

826
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:02,620
experience so there's a college impact

827
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,110
anybody here is it so it can recently

828
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,909
came out and they got funding from

829
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,130
another box instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> accelerated year</font>

830
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,080
the idea is they're not doing anything

831
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:14,650
you well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is creating</font>

832
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,360
these kind of gym places the call

833
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,860
studios you can just go there with

834
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,930
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile app that</font>

835
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,640
kind of links all you with one pack and

836
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,199
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and rescan your attorney</font>

837
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,330
and unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

838
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want so nobody tells you</font>

839
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,210
what you need to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

840
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,730
idea is that are capitalizing in the

841
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,030
fact that you can have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

842
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,889
all four of you from

843
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,240
or whatever go to the same place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

844
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,299
thought that's what they're capitalizing

845
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,989
on and that's when I wear good clothes I

846
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">too so that we won't hear a bottom up</font>

847
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:48,779
into the other share here that's kind of

848
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:51,690
very very fundamental access for

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,970
everyone dials to block chain on how is

850
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,040
the block chain itself think so good

855
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,799
that's kind of a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notes so</font>

858
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,490
here at work on this is the layer that

859
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,290
share all the data across all those

860
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,950
computers that are connected to the

allows rules to get passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so the</font>

whole idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> double standing always</font>

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,220
giving no answer is a rule that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

866
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,810
almost always certainly believe it so

00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,939
taxing there are two notable

868
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,520
applications is going to be curse or

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,990
separate from from the data which

870
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,990
connects the block chain together

871
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,190
this any interpret currency so I kind of

872
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:52,339
put them as you know k<font color="#E5E5E5"> one group but it</font>

873
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,410
could literally anything there on the

commercial idea to kind of do street

screaming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting using a blockchain</font>

880
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see growing up the ladder you're</font>

881
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,399
reaching already the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shooting protocol</font>

882
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,990
there there's mostly does the last clear

883
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,519
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out very very soon</font>

884
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,919
he's actually being able to be

885
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:25,339
operations on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> block chain so if you</font>

886
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,859
use like empty amazon release that thing

887
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:29,869
it's gotta do<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy or that but I'm use</font>

888
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">presses you can order one thing and</font>

889
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,339
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order in their game</font>

890
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,869
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea basically reduce one</font>

891
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:37,788
function to just kind of pressing the

892
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,829
button right so surely that we're going

893
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:41,720
to see the blockchain we're gonna see

894
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:44,559
Apple the issue is created on top of the

895
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,169
block block chain using four elements

896
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,599
first one is the transactions second one

897
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,609
is it blocks struggle together in an

898
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,180
order the third one is detectors actions

899
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:57,950
and last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the amount so to speak</font>

900
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,750
it could be token or whatever but the

901
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,549
amount being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transport so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

902
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,680
to see those four components people are

903
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:05,538
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really creative commander</font>

904
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
in an interesting manner to make

905
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,340
applications

906
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,759
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think about like in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> app</font>

907
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,520
games so what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did to gimme block</font>

908
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,220
cheese or the apps you can I do to the

909
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,840
Bitcoin block chain and by the way I

910
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,459
should really mention here it's not the

911
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,860
Bitcoin block chain / say at this point

912
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,900
it could be a blockchain because they

913
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:28,280
generalize infrastructure is present

914
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,280
across almost every cryptocurrency

915
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,980
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the whole idea behind</font>

916
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,290
different about relaxes is you have

917
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,060
certain known fundamental truths truth

918
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,890
is more philosophical but really the

919
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,590
same idea then you can build something

920
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,609
on top but so so do you know that

921
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,560
something is always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a</font>

922
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,630
certain way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Kevin take advantage of</font>

923
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,100
it and exploit it to build higher level

924
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,780
functions and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about for</font>

925
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,420
entire countries in a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

926
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,790
probably more understandable idea is the

927
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,220
idea of preemption and that's when you

928
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,250
know on the processor church a task so

929
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,470
in in creation perhaps give a test it on

930
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,630
the run queue so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like</font>

931
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,160
processes running on the processor

932
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,170
itself until then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword is</font>

933
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,850
going to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the processor but the</font>

934
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,400
processor<font color="#E5E5E5"> determines something else</font>

935
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:20,040
order for take it off put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the wake</font>

936
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,420
you something he doesn't go on this

937
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,100
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> room full of task is called</font>

938
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,470
friendship the scandal we're trying to

939
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,230
do where it go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the example of</font>

940
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,149
streaming right so something stops that

941
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,100
so if one device was screaming for its

942
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 minutes that device texting enough</font>

943
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,420
not another<font color="#E5E5E5"> device get put out there so</font>

944
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,190
imagine someone watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

945
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,400

946
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have access to X a moderate so one</font>

947
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,110
when that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is done their</font>

948
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,460
advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> loses act and someone else gets</font>

axis which is who's Gary box or

950
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:56,130
something like that um so this is kind

951
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:58,380
of a move<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Club this is</font>

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,630
get he finally called young

<font color="#E5E5E5">handler kind of the enterprise cloud</font>

956
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,109
that we proposed to create a spa the

957
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,359
first one is obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server so</font>

958
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:19,710
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the idea of blockchain</font>

959
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,650
running for everybody to close it off

960
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:25,800
and blockchain running just for my

961
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:28,230
organization not now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Davi attitude this</font>

962
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,060
is that the organization has their

963
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,130
infrastructure and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a kind</font>

964
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,680
of private block chain which really was

965
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the initial intended use right so so</font>

966
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,100
totally didn't envision that down the

967
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">line people would start to use boxing</font>

968
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,040
for assets he thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would</font>

969
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,560
really be

970
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,320
way to get a hit across below with money

971
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,259
but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 servers so you have</font>

972
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,850
to have your own servers to run it

973
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,800
started obviously which is the induction

974
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,589
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting your story storage</font>

975
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,900
component you guys and these are

976
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,760
not just events per se like you're

977
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,560
recording the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the events</font>

978
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,230
are you stored elsewhere all your

979
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,890
recording is metadata on top of it would

980
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,200
say X event have in relation to why that

981
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,670
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole idea of contextual</font>

982
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,129
knowledge which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really going to be</font>

983
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:17,360
pushed forward by a lot of leaders in

984
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">superior or images you don't need</font>

985
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,030
introducing about an event that's

986
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,610
happening in the next cement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

987
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,750
happening what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need is the</font>

988
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,030
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how these relate</font>

989
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,410
future so a thousand events<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen but</font>

990
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,330
like you really need a thousand events

991
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,220
know they can probably go store in any

992
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,080
hair is what it need more importantly

993
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,730
right now is how those other effects

994
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,410
related to figure out what's important

995
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,530
so in the context we really figure out

996
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:42,020
some things so the nodes are obviously

997
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:45,200
kind of a few you know publicly verified

998
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,790
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font>

999
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,270
they'll have to be private servers that

1000
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:51,620
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of that um and so</font>

1001
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:54,100
moving on I don't want to spend like too

1002
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:57,970
much time on your will be proposed but

1003
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,970
so are you

1004
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,210
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of novel about about this is</font>

1005
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,740
that we can take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1006
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:08,519
features that are present<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1007
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:13,288
blockchain for doing your things that

1008
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:14,819
are really new in the sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> save</font>

1009
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">any vending machines right so we have</font>

1010
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:19,019
any issues all over here someone

1011
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:22,049
actually has to come by fire calls it

1012
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">come by see like how much money this</font>

1013
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:25,349
machine you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of got taken out</font>

1014
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,220
really well and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

1015
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:31,259
imagine kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> paint network that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1016
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,078
use vending machines to get kind of

1017
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:36,960
property<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lasts so this machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1018
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,269
have access to this area for X number of

1019
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,549
time when that one's out that machine

1020
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:44,279
needs you cannot pay to kind of be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

1021
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:45,930
to let the place there you're talking

1022
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:49,710
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the implementation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of smart</font>

1023
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:53,009
contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> but logical operations where</font>

1024
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,140
you can cut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the air at the</font>

1025
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:58,540
most basic level this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the idea of</font>

1026
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,609
taking a theorems Turing completeness

1027
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,520
and breaking it down into problems that

1028
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:06,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already on departure so instead of</font>

1029
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">me proud to say okay well during the</font>

1030
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">disc let me but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one who's that little a</font>

1031
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,790
block<font color="#CCCCCC"> chain I am targeting more</font>

1032
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,560
fundamentally can we do something that

1033
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is already present on the block check</font>

1034
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,759
and he built logical operation is not

1035
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,319
talkative right so imagine imitating

1036
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,350
someone would just use the scripting

1037
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,460
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> inviting application in arguing</font>

1038
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,400
work you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scripting language</font>

1039
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,990
all your reaction ended up doing is

1040
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,900
framing your problem in framing your

1041
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,629
whole idea in sequence of problems to

1042
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,890
all of which the answer's no until you

1043
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:44,560
reach the stage where you know is the

1044
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:46,480
right answer I think I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about most</font>

1045
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,310
of this I apologize last one cut off<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1046
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:54,550
i already mentioned that the streaming

1047
00:42:48,310 --> 00:43:01,060
stops when the contract is nullified so

1048
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:03,340
um yeah here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with different</font>

1049
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">logical axis will you but it works on</font>

1050
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,710
your next I'll take my work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is sort</font>

1051
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,240
of property<font color="#CCCCCC"> in resource</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allocation where</font>

1052
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,820
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we defend</font>

1053
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,368
like this prop this asset can be

1054
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,980
allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this entity for X amount of</font>

1055
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:20,650
time and you can kind of do autonomous

1056
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,230
property allocation and then turning it

1057
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,520
back on track like all automatically

1058
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,310
there's going for a person to do this

1059
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:31,960
and this could apply to carry you know

1060
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:34,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're screening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I he's</font>

1061
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,260
gonna fly to<font color="#CCCCCC"> random</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machines which is</font>

1062
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,790
kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting example because</font>

1063
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:44,050
that's not so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them actually</font>

1064
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:45,940
obviously Ivan just because I agree so

1065
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:50,050
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I learn it there was a lot that</font>

1066
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,310
when I in the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> event I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1067
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I was running and is kind of really</font>

1068
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,540
putting a proposal together I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1069
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,880
about 55 60 hours a week so it's gonna

1070
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:00,610
kind of tough but uh yeah he's probably

1071
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,619
hard to do it logical logical access to

1072
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,300
particular doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so I had committed</font>

1073
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,760
the ATM folks were really creating

1074
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,580
something so powerful that allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1075
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot more than just logical level axis</font>

1076
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:16,480
so they do a lot more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i</font>

1077
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:20,170
propose to this of next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> is things</font>

1078
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,960
like darker enterprise cloud deployment

1079
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:26,050
software is really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard get up</font>

1080
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,040
top five years

1081
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to learn those technologies and another</font>

1082
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,600
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just I guess kinda</font>

1083
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,880
obvious retrospect is a block<font color="#CCCCCC"> chin is</font>

1084
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,529
amazing for recording device it can do

1085
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,300
that I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we really pushed it to</font>

1086
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,070
its limit reveal yourself just how

1087
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,320
amazing it got like I could do the whole

1088
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:46,630
streaming example on my phone you know

1089
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,220
indeed kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did and it was</font>

1090
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">really amazing like a blockchain could</font>

1091
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,230
record against especially what I mention

1092
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:55,529
area which is relational so it could

1093
00:44:53,230 --> 00:45:03,670
record contextual information in

1094
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolute phenomenon that that's it thank</font>

1095
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,060
you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>
