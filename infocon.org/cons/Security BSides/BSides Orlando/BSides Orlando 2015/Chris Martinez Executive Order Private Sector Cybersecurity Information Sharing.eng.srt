<font color="#CCCCCC">that i mean the the way that this field</font>

of how it changes in our society

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:19,299
so fix this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so introducing the</font>

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,269
executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> order on promoting private</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sector cybersecurity information sharing</font>

50
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,680
the purpose of presenting this topic is

51
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,210
to bring awareness to everyone that what

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,460
is going on in our society especially

53
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,370
with our field and community of the

54
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security that also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> includes</font>

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and politically so we as</font>

56
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,820
a cyber security community are going to

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,340
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> confronted with proposed changes</font>

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,340
whether we like it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not thanks a lot</font>

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,070
so however<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is our responsibility to</font>

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,090
identify what is going on analyze the

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,370
effects and also respond appropriately

62
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,290
so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive work the</font>

63
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,750
executive order<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a framework that</font>

and protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against cyber threats the</font>

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,760
framework contains four key points

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,000
encouraging private sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,180
collaboration improve private public

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,220
information sharing provide strong

73
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,050
privacy and civil liberties protections

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,450
and pave the way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> future legislation</font>

75
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,210
now rapid information sharing is an

76
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">essential component for effective cyber</font>

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,440
security protection it enables us

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,419
companies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work together to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respond to</font>

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,420
threats rather than operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a loan</font>

80
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,920
so how does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect us well for the</font>

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time in history we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

security information with third-parties

84
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,340
and also the government as we know what

85
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,660
the NSA that<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's still very touchy</font>

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,549
topic for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people because</font>

87
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,190
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is privacy we've been taught</font>

88
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been rolling with</font>

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,650
Congress<font color="#E5E5E5"> in recent years has attempted</font>

92
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,720
to pass legislation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font>

95
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,680
have been shot down by the concern over

101
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,260
information sharing is one of the few

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,710
ways organizations can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> proactive in</font>

103
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,230
dealing with cyber attacks now that is

104
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,330
huge especially as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security company he</font>

105
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,230
is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> look we need to be proactive</font>

106
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,330
and this is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it so now that</font>

107
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">we know what it is and how it affects us</font>

108
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,000
will drill into how it works so the

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,560
executive order encourages the

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,170
development of information sharing and

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,070

points for cybersecurity information

sharing and collaboration within the

encouraging the creation of is a RS the

communities that share information

121
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,900
across a region or in response to a

<font color="#E5E5E5">specific emerging threat in an industry</font>

among its customers or partners so

127
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,490
that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a upcoming business idea for</font>

128
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,919
a lot of companies is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become that non</font>

for profit company for any threats that

130
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,260
they are receiving either through honey

131
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:00,070
pots or any other means we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

132
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,740
see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of these come up very soon</font>

133
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:06,860
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the 2015 Cisco annual</font>

security report<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of high urgency CDEs</font>

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:15,889
were actively exploited now that is that

136
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:18,830
is where the that is where is AO is

137
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:26,210
common to play so with that one percent

138
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:28,460
of high urgencies well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very kind</font>

139
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:33,760
also similar to like ice axe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

140
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:37,760
do questions after nice so<font color="#E5E5E5"> haha</font>

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:42,710
according to Cisco abs<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright according</font>

142
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,990
to cisco's 2015 report so one percent of

143
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,760
higher Juicy CDs were exploited however

144
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that means that more companies need to</font>

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,479
be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> proactive and also that these</font>

146
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:56,630
threats need to be shared more quickly

147
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,370
so collaborating with is a owes via the

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:34,769
OS so one more thing was the to fund the

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,720
creation of a nonprofit organization to

210

215
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,160
here is to keep data private while also

being functional to share to other

will go into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more detail in</font>

261
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:45,059
just a moment but that has also gone

cyber threat data with the government

352
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,180
now this does bring up a lot of

353
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions I see some eyebrows being</font>

354
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:39,040
raised in the crowd so you know we're so

355
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,260
used to the privacy so used to being

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,310
this year and being taught time after

358
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">time again that sharing is not great</font>

359
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,979
especially with third parties on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,930
government how much are they surveilling

361
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,350
well I want you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that this is</font>

362
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,420
not meant to be surveillance on anybody

363
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,890
but this is simply meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

364
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,630
companies with the United States from

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,910
you know protect companies in the United

366
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,160
States from breaches such as the big

367
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,659
Sony breach that happened that was

368
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big driving factors</font>

369
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,820
of this executive order was the Sony

370
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,339
breach and other other breaches that

371
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:18,399
come along way and big companies such as

372
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,809
HP like we talked about and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

373
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,449
being proactive

374
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:25,499
that the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share this</font>

375
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,749
information rapidly is going far beyond

376
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:31,740
software security solutions and also

377
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:36,399
services such as that now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down</font>

378
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:40,179
to us being proficient in our processes

379
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:45,820
and procedures so with that it is time

380
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:48,700
even actually even on HP just I just

381
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep going forward but I at the HP</font>

382
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,769
software summon HP had also said that

383
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:57,009
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Securities even as a</font>

385
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:03,100
agree with the processes and people that

386
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:06,039
are involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the companies need to</font>

388
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:12,158
own processes procedures so with that

389
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,759
said this executive order does bring up

390
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:18,909
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bills or a lot of bills coming</font>

391
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,350
into play<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially with a you'll</font>

392
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,749
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you guys have ever heard</font>

393
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,369
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new bill that's coming out</font>

394
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:27,309
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be seizing</font>

395
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:31,600
assets for anybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cyber threat</font>

396
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:35,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">to US companies so with that that could</font>

397
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be its own top again itself however that</font>

398
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">is also going to be a big one that this</font>

399
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to pave legislation and those</font>

400
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:46,539
common set of voluntary standards that

401
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,909
will affect the bills<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come so now are</font>

402
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,799
there any questions i kinda ran through

403
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:56,940
this pretty quickly

404
00:18:51,799 --> 00:19:02,658
so any questions yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

405
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:09,119
this rain is a voluntary standards to

406
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:11,549
protect the information yes correct

407
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:16,879
presumably they will be identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

408
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:19,529
they make exactly okay and the next

409
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:21,629
legislation we're expecting is a build

410
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:25,169
its going to grant liabilities companies

411
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:27,809
who share information which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a oh</font>

412
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,639
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're going to share all</font>

413
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,989
the information because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISA of us</font>

414
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,639
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that under their</font>

415
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:34,830
volunteers they're going to analyze it

416
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,020
protect it right without<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this</font>

417
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,320
is a way to

418
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,440
by companies against releasing public

419
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,970
information that can then be made

420
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,820
available not only to intelligence

421
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,790
agencies but potentially to the general

422
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:58,129
public right<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm potentially to the</font>

423
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:59,450
general public not so much well and see

424
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,830
there are going to be a lot of questions

425
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with this bill in this</font>

426
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,689
executive order that even even in the

427
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,620
bill itself in its current state is not

428
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,710
clear to a full extent however we also

429
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:17,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask the question of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable is data</font>

430
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,970
now so with having that insurance of you

431
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,560
know or getting that liability taken off

432
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,450
of companies just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sharing their</font>

433
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,550
cybersecurity information it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really goes</font>

434
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show how valuable that will be to our</font>

435
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">own government and to the industries and</font>

436
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,310
also to everybody else in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world so</font>

437
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,260
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of questions and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font>

438
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,780
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to state that this topic and</font>

439
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,740
presentation is meant to be informative

440
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,000
and not influential so as a community

441
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,530
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

442
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,270
ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would love to hear these</font>

ahead look glad to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

447
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:59,519
just in executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> order that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

448
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,919
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wink is executive order of</font>

449
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,929
promoting private sector cybersecurity

450
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,989
information sharing its ongoing right

451
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:10,279
now it is in in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just got passed</font>

452
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:13,859
in the house of leave with a 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one</font>

453
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:24,899
pass so it will be moving on is going on

454
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:28,199
is active right now all traffic good

455
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:31,949
point which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ingenious move so</font>

456
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">theoretically passwords and stuff could</font>

457
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:43,120
be shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> through I guess</font>

458
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:46,120
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things in what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prove</font>

459
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">then if they're all be indemnified you</font>

460
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,250
know it there's no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of saying hey you</font>

461
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,250
know what you guys up your

462
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,870
response and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty of the</font>

463
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,310
evolution of information security

464
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,889
there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be something</font>

465
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's coming up or a possibility or a</font>

466
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,990
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaching this data and</font>

467
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,610
especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

468
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">procedures those will have to also</font>

469
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,300
evolve and possibly even this case be

470
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,990
built up to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best security</font>

471
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,490
against you know man-in-middle-attacks

472
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,410
because that was actually one of the

473
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,020
thoughts i was thinking in this bill as

474
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">well or in this executive order and just</font>

475
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole framework that's being laid</font>

476
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,590
out so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question and that's</font>

477
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we're going to also have</font>

478
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,330
to look into and find out

479
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,450
the executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> order is more aimed for</font>

480
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,250
the process and the procedure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the</font>

481
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,950
executive order<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself calming obviously</font>

482
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from the administration of you</font>

483
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,070
know not from the technical side but

484
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,659
more of the executive side this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

485
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,179
definitely just going for the process

486
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:19,200
and procedure as far as the technical

487
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,790
standpoint as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed over here in this</font>

488
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,940
guy and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

489
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,670
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information this was very high</font>

490
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,980
level over here but the idea yes you get

491
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,540
that thread exchange database or you're

492
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,760
just a threat exchange centralized

493
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,570
location to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push out to other</font>

494
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,450
industries so integrating sins and ids

495
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:42,929
IPS tools and any other security tools

496
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:46,110
is definitely obviously it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

497
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:48,810
done but this executive order in itself

498
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,969
does not detail any you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when it</font>

499
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to how it's going to read that how</font>

500
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,180
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redact information or how</font>

501
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,180
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even transfer oh</font>

502
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:09,320
the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is no as far as</font>

503
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:11,500
the executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> order goes correct all</font>

504
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,500
right

505
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:25,310
ah that's actually a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good one so</font>

506
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,310
as far as international companies go if

507
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,230
the if the company is not bred in the

508
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">United States but it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> located in</font>

509
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,310
the United States it does not go out to

510
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,810
an international<font color="#E5E5E5"> company however if it</font>

511
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,060
does belong to United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States but it's</font>

512
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,790
branched out somewhere else then it is

513
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,389
it's acceptable it's it's a trusted

514
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,409
source at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point can you repeat your</font>

515
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,410
second part of the question

516
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,830
see

517
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,740
right

518
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,420
well as this framework stands that's all

519
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on how the organization</font>

520
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,510
goes out with those processes so we were

521
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,850
the way that this executive order are

522
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:38,060
standing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they do not have a</font>

523
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,580
set standard for that in fact they

524
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,830
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even go in depth that much which</font>

525
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,600
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very surprising was one of</font>

526
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,040
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I didn't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

527
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,750
executive order when reading it however

528
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,960
when it comes to being susceptible to

529
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,670
being you know starting to become

530
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,960
monitored by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA or whatever the</font>

531
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:01,580
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that aspect that that's</font>

532
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,490
an entirely different subject when it

533
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,520
comes to as far as what's neck what's

534
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that boundary that was not</font>

535
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear in the executive order and that's</font>

536
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,590
again that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a</font>

537
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">community we definitely should look into</font>

538
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,770
green shirt

539
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:30,100
this exactly

540
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:33,549
and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely right is a OS will</font>

541
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,219
be a huge target and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably one of</font>

542
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:38,408
the biggest targets ever as as they

543
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,840
become more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more popular especially</font>

544
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:46,029
the smaller ones yeah if as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

545
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">information security that's needed any</font>

546
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,840
tools and process of procedures that are

547
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:51,629
needed for is a OS those are really

548
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be extremely strong and</font>

549
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:56,678
coming back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the NSA on that I mean</font>

550
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,850
when we have any type of monitoring

551
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,639
especially from the federal government

552
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,619
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with those information sharing</font>

553
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:06,008
and analysis organizations that actually

554
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:08,999
helps them so with that aspect it's

555
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:12,129
having another eye on what's going on so

556
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:16,629
there's really a lot that goes on with

557
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:18,699
that idea as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so i would also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

558
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:21,039
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to agree and say that is a 0</font>

559
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,749
is will be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge target when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

560
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,220
to when it comes time when these are

561
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:26,529
more implemented they already are

562
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,139
implemented but when these become more

563
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:31,139
and more popular leave a hand

564
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,700
well that's an entirely different bill

565
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,439
itself that's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this month yeah</font>

566
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,630
that's going to be this month it's

567
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,070
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just came out I saw I was</font>

568
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:03,490
reading up on the articles about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font>

569
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:09,460
the other day it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just popped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dial and</font>

570
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:11,730
seeing that's also another idea so what

571
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,730
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

572
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:24,080
Wow and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the read into the</font>

573
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,710
bill to see how to what extent it goes

574
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,419
through but also to respond back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

575
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,820
you know it's not sharing all

576
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,280
information but really cyber threat data

577
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,169
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font>

578
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,230
guys were to get compromised or we did

579
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:41,150
see you note any type of any type of

580
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,860
threat that came in maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CNC</font>

581
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,980
connection or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be</font>

582
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,570
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets shared with the</font>

583
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,210
government not necessarily every

584
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,110
information not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Social Security numbers</font>

585
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,110
of people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

586
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,020
losses

587
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:16,469
and it also depends on to what extent

588
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,860

628
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,149
topic when it comes to the changes that

629
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,460
are coming into play<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this with the other build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was briefly</font>

635
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,830
and it's actually most likely going to

636
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,910
affect the bug bounties more than

637
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody else so I am also interested to</font>

639
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:44,629
point and that's for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next bill to</font>

644
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">already has</font>

645
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,750
so it was really

646
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,330
different

647
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:27,770
different bill but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean a word</font>

648
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,750
that we're definitely having some very

649
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:33,600
different bills coming up that affect us

650
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:38,550
bug bounties and other entities that are

651
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">also doing doing things like that simply</font>

652
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,760
put so take us on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand right</font>

653
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,760
here yeah

654
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,870
discovered

655
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:06,879
I when it comes to with high trust I

656
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,848
don't know by the time that actually

657
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,250
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know film when the</font>

658
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ioc's got out but however when the IOC's</font>

659
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,889
dig it out and that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the the</font>

660
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,750
information sharing and analysis

661
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,760
organizations come into play that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

662
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,820
speed up the process of you know

663
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:36,820
detection and then analyzing and then

664
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:39,070
sharing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was reading up about that</font>

665
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,129
and these are shared through sticks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

666
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,899
taxi so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two different</font>

667
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:46,089
protocols for sharing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

668
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:49,540
government sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the government</font>

669
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:53,230
information as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that however as</font>

670
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:56,800
far as more strict protocols that I am

671
00:34:53,230 --> 00:35:00,010
not aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of right now so</font>

672
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,080
any other questions or comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

673
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,490
the purpose of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know the</font>

674
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,040
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little bit shorter</font>

675

people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get have been pretty</font>

678
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,560
opinionated on this from the ones I

679
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,360
brought up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and so really</font>
