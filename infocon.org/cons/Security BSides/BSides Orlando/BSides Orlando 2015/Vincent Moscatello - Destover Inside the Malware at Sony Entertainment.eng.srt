1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,930
Sony's machines so to the analysis so

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,250
the very first it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important when</font>

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,080
you're doing malware analysis to be

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,969
pretty methodical when you're analyzing

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,559
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> at work all right that is doing</font>

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">some bookkeeping in the beginning so</font>

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,000
like collecting hashes what are the

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,090
names of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware samples and that</font>

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
sort of thing um and also another a

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,170
fairly important thing is to Ghani

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,909
against like some existing antivirus see

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,470
if this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an already known our</font>

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,359
sample or something completely new

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,480
dropped on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a honey pot or something</font>

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,219
right so the malware analysis that

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,910
you'll I mean the malware simple you'll

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,290
find in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the like the reports why the FBI</font>

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,800
in stock it has this hash here this is

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,870
the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> from virustotal basically</font>

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,099
you upload your<font color="#E5E5E5"> power sample to</font>

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,099
virustotal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it against a</font>

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,780
whole bunch of anti viruses here's also

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,520
an option for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh is this a</font>

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,440
good memory stamp is this actually a

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,420
real good piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software or is it</font>

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,399
actually a piece of malware so 32 people

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,530
said this is a bad piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software and</font>

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,390
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are probably gonna have a</font>

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,820
very bad um the malware sample is

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,070
actually a different variant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,110
analyzed it actually has this hash my

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,298
phone virus here you can definitely

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">still find them our sample that has this</font>

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,320
hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is the first one i came</font>

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,150
across and three people said it was I

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,270
guess this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of shame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,299
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the antivirus</font>

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,970
that said this wasn't an hour samples of

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,450
view of Agra slides at 47 out of 57

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,179
antivirus said that this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad evil</font>

41
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,250
in our example right these are the tin

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,990
that said it was fine which is a little

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprising these you know you recognize</font>

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,020
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> names</font>

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,330
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just be as the time that got</font>

46
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,000
uploaded and analyzed but it was pretty

47
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:58,570
recent like three weeks and three days

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,580
since when I made<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide so also</font>

49
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,139
when you're running it I'm not where

50
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,520
sample you usually don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it</font>

51
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like on your regular computer views</font>

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,039
that's bad you don't want to run you

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,810
don't infect your own machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an</font>

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,670
hour right so you normally run it inside

55
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,430
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I use</font>

56
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,720
VMware Workstation 11 it's pretty

57
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,730
effective so nice thing about running

58
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,680
malware samples and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of</font>

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,090
virtual environments like<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware is you</font>

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,420
can also set up like virtual networks

61
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,610
and stuff so you can monitor like the

62
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,130
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic do packet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> captions and</font>

63
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,340
stuff with wireshark so vmware is very

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,590
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for that so right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

65
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">after uploading at the virus total one</font>

66
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,120
thing I like to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,890
well right-click the executable and run

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,870
it as an administrator to see if there's

69
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,019
something obviously inside the retro

70
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,640
night right just to see what does ah so

71
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,880
when i right clicked and ran this

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,390
malware sample as an administrator um it

73
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,200
wasn't a little anti-climactic it just

74
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,760
produced another execute on the desktop

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,589
yeah a little disappointing creek for a

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,899
meal our sample called white ball we're

77
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,820
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> alike destroy like right the very</font>

78
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,310
cool environment it just made another

79
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,579
executable so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a letdown</font>

80
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right we need to do more so another</font>

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,109
thing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

82
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,849
guess this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of falls more the</font>

83
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,769
bookkeeping is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there just runny and</font>

84
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,390
as an administrator and seeing what

85
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,319
happens let's stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into an</font>

86
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,849
environment that has a bunch of

87
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,280
monitoring tools on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see what it</font>

88
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,170
does inside of like a sandbox so a

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,810
sandbox will produce kind of like a

90
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:32,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">general kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an hour overview report</font>

91
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:35,689
that you can kind of look at so i

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,870
uploaded the sample to malware calm in a

93
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:44,579
lwr calm and it runs it inside the

94
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,579
sandbox called<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuckoo so it didn't</font>

95
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,349
exactly do it I was expecting it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

96
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,909
it didn't contact any host it didn't

97
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,399
compact any domains which is little

98
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,959
suspicious there's some useful

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,120
information like that it might contain

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,459
some encrypted or compressed data that's

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,799
useful information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it has been</font>

102
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,939
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> by at least one antivirus on</font>

103
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:10,379
anti virus total so and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only produces</font>

104
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:12,510
some ICMP traffic which there's no drop

105
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,440
files so what's going on we have we

106
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,719
clicked at ourselves and drop this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gfx</font>

107
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,829
whatever binary so even the sandbox

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,820
didn't pick up on that which I thought

109
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:29,220
was a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit um yeah so yeah we see</font>

110
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,780
the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> GFX trade yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XD x ESO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes</font>

111
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,979
aren't always one hundred percent

112
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,229
reliable so doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it our like doing</font>

113
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,780
actually having an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts look at</font>

114
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,479
our samples you get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

115
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">information out of that so one tool</font>

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,930
that's really useful when doing malware

117
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,880
analysis is this tool called cff explore

118
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,440
if you're not familiar with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,669
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to get some general</font>

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,190
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the binary you're</font>

121
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,609
analyzing you can also like flip a few

122
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,740
bits too just like change some things

123
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make analysis a lot easier and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

124
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,039
actually came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> really handy how many</font>

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you here raised by show of hands how</font>

126
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,590
many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a CTF before or</font>

127
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">cdf challenges all right yeah</font>

128
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,520
good number of you so I really really

129
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,010
popular CTF is ghost in the shell code

130
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,049
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fun you essentially</font>

131
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,960
get that hack of a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> game and give</font>

132
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,430
yourself like super speed super jump in

133
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,159
you try to solve all these challenges

134
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are hacking deleted so yeah one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

135
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,800
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

136
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,170
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do for example is</font>

137
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,290
disabled the randomization address of

138
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,900
like a dll and all the game logic in the

139
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,420
CTF was like captain the side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dll</font>

140
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,190
so when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving it from like Ida</font>

141
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,370
or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Tolly it can be useful</font>

142
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,350
like disabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> I randomization right so</font>

143
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used it for the sony malware</font>

144
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,960
sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of get a general</font>

145
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview see you get the hashes you can</font>

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,250
tell some more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

147
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,140
executable like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example it was</font>

148
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,350
compiled using microsoft visual c++

149
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,789
compiler right that's pretty useful

150
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,500
another a little suspicious thing there

151
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,750
right we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the portable</font>

152
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,780
executable size was 56 kilobytes and

153
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,390
then the file size was 430 point 3 8

154
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:18,469
kilobytes so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this was a part</font>

155
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:20,090
of the executable there we go um so yeah

156
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,860
if you compare this to something like

157
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,590
putty which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like an ssh client</font>

158
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,260
you see like the file size is 472 built

159
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,030
lights in the portable executable sizes

160
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">472 kilobytes so something might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

161
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,479
little bit off there right another

162
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,830
really useful tool is called PE view

163
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,990
this actually gives some pretty

164
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,030
significant information like when

165
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,430
exactly was this malware sample compiled

166
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,979
and this date here circled in green is a

167
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,700
little suspicious right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> November</font>

168
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,910
22nd 2014 there's tax on sony

169
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,880
entertainment<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened the 23rd or 24th</font>

170
00:06:52,910 --> 00:07:00,180
right yeah so

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,560
hmm interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so another</font>

172
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,750
thing you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask yourself when</font>

173
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,140
analyzing them our sample is is this

174
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,820
malware sample packed in our sample is

175
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,750
packed it makes it significantly more

176
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,280
difficult to reverse engineer there are

177
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,400
legitimate reasons to pack a program

178
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,229
like maybe you want to use implement

179
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,169
that as kind of a form of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DRM make your</font>

180
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,760
program harder to crack and also the

181
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,120
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of packing a program is to</font>

182
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,200
make the executable size smaller yeah

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the size of your</font>

184
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,250
executable in general what happens

185
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">during a pack when our samples packed is</font>

186
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically decompresses and becomes</font>

187
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,270
larger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory so why would an hour</font>

188
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,099
analysts actually want the pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

189
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,010
program well you can up to skate a lot

190
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,810
of strings and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it makes it</font>

191
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,460
harder for someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like looking</font>

192
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,020
at your malware sample to reverse

193
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,549
engineering yes how people

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,070
reverse-engineer your mother simple pad

195
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,410
so yeah just asking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

196
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:59,849
metal where sample packed and pretty

197
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,890
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer was no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p.i.p eid is a</font>

198
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,500
great tool for kind of identifying

199
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,510
whether or not this rather not a mount

200
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,830
where sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> is packed so it wasn't and</font>

201
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can also look at some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

202
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,969
histograms which give you an overview of

203
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,770
entropy the text segment of the

204
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,110
executable didn't really indicate that

205
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,820
it was packed<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you also have the rest</font>

206
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,310
of the program which was weird because

207
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,880
that wasn't part of a segment and it was

208
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty high in entropy so this file as</font>

209
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,870
you'll find out this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> our sample it</font>

210
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,950
kind of drops all their executables and

211
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:35,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of modular and runs</font>

212
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,880
components right so back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see FF</font>

213
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,500
explore you see here one of the things

214
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do to tell if a malware samples</font>

215
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">packed is if the virtual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs the</font>

216
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:49,670
executable is much better is much larger

217
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,230
than the raw size so we say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the raw</font>

218
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,240
sighs it's like the actual size<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

219
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">file in virtual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> size is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the size of</font>

220
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,520
memory so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so you can only</font>

221
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so far with just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic tools</font>

222
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,790
that give you a general review of like

223
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,660
the like a static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis of a program</font>

224
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,449
so one of the things you'll have to do

225
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,890
is kind of do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> code analysis so we</font>

226
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,140
say code analysis is actually kind of

227
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,310
looking at the assembly language looking

228
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,350
at the Assembly of them our sample so

229
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,670
unfortunately malware authors aren't

230
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,500
real keen on giving you giving you the

231
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,790
source code to their programs right yeah

232
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,670
they probably don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

233
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that um so how do you get static</font>

234
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,709
analysis you take I<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cats and you read</font>

235
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,870
the move<font color="#E5E5E5"> against</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malware balloons ah so</font>

236
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,700
my general idea here is that you get

237
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,800
static electricity but as I found out

238
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my vice present Daniel normal people</font>

239
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,589
don't rub balloons off the Kings cats I

240
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,449
don't advise it yeah you could use any

241
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:54,770
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fare to get static electricity</font>

242
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,750
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the tool I use to do</font>

243
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,960
static analysis on this binary is called

244
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,060
Ida I used I to free it pretty much

245
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,700
suits the purposes of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

246
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,500
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze it Ida pro obviously has</font>

247
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,320
a lot of really really useful features

248
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,820
for example a x-rays decompiler can kind

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,010
of give you almost like the source code

250
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,320
of program but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know just the free</font>

251
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,610
version of IDA disassembler you're

252
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,870
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to get a simply</font>

253
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,240
language you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of look at</font>

254
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,370
that well so yeah as I talked about

255
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">before um this malware sample drops</font>

256
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,060
different components so just looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

257
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,100
our original executable which had that

258
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,560
long hash which I kind of need dest over

259
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">exe it dropped that you can't really get</font>

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,640
a full analysis of the malware sample

261
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,930
without also<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the smaller</font>

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,510
components like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gfx</font>

263
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,089
ray<font color="#CCCCCC"> exe executable so you have to look</font>

264
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,670
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> both things they do different stuff</font>

265
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:47,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">um yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

266
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,589
modulated line so yeah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

267
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the Mauer sample does if you look</font>

268
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the assembly is that it</font>

269
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,339
installs itself as a service so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

270
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,290
the reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mauer might want to</font>

271
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,589
install itself as a service is to become

272
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,180
persistent so they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey maybe the</font>

273
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,250
computer reboots and you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

274
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">running you want your mouse able to keep</font>

275
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,089
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> me well yes install it as a</font>

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,620
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can also hide me from</font>

277
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,860
the process list by installing as a

278
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,600
service to that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so just</font>

279
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,760
an overview kind of like so we all kind

280
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of understand like what this assembly</font>

281
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,970
kind of looks like and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is</font>

282
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,149
so you have this function called fluffy

283
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,649
and it has a parameter called sheep well

284
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:30,450
this is like an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a picture of</font>

285
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,830
what the stack looks like so the first

286
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing you do is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of push the</font>

287
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,230
parameters of the function until the

288
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,540
stack then you push the return address

289
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,920
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you exit the function then you</font>

290
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:48,810
save your old base pointer and then you

291
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:50,969
move the fit you boo ESP and the EBP to

292
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,380
create like a new stack frame but the

293
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,600
most important thing here to take away

294
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,430
is that you push the parameters of the

295
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,339
function on to the stack first before

296
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,380
you call the function right so taking a

297
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,600
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this we see that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

298
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,339
function create service a that the

299
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,740
malware sample uses and all these things

300
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,650
above it that are like pushes those are

301
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,390
the parameters the function<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we see</font>

302
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,740
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting things for example now</font>

303
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,410
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the name of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

304
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,360
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> not them our sample in salt so</font>

305
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:23,750
it calls itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> win schedule management</font>

306
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,750
service we also see some interesting

307
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:30,868
some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> variables to we see</font>

308
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:35,069
that service it gives it the service

309
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">autostart flag leg right it also xor's</font>

310
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:39,868
some other flags to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

311
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">little a kind of an annoying thing about</font>

312
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:46,079
Ida<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right click on</font>

313
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,899
these numbers and like select which what

314
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:52,589
the name of it is normally you'll just

315
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,819
get kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a number there yeah all</font>

316
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,790
I good luck is a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

317
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:59,790
like predicting what the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

318
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,529
variables are another thing is when it's

319
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,329
running commands in general the Maori

320
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,399
sample actually creates a service real

321
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,079
quick it calls whatever it needs to do

322
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,399
and it deletes the service shortly after

323
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,160
so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that just kind of</font>

324
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,600
hide itself inside of the hide itself

325
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,269
from the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so I</font>

326
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting</font>

327
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,819
alright so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mallory sample is</font>

328
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,290
actually an outward form which if you're

329
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:25,589
a system administrator it probably looks

330
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,019
a little more like this something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

331
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:32,669
like doom rather than Shelby from

332
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:35,189
adventure time see ya so how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how</font>

333
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:38,160
does this worm work actually uses a

334
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,299
pretty primitive method<font color="#E5E5E5"> propagating</font>

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,910
across the network it actually uses

336
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,209
windows file sharing right that's a

337
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:49,069
pretty old pretty old attacked right

338
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:53,998
yeah it creatures but I guess the most

339
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:56,939
significant of these is actually copying

340
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,949
the binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the new machine right so</font>

341
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:02,849
you see here before we call this

342
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:05,579
function sub 40 to 60 70 we get the

343
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,330
username username and the password and

344
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we passed that to do I wmic</font>

345
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,740
are you but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about IDs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extra and i</font>

346
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,540
just love sheep so that picture doesn't

347
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:24,520
have much to do with presentation um

348
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:26,959
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um what other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IE fxj is</font>

349
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,650
when we were in that executable before

350
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,690
all did was kind of just drop that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gfx</font>

351
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,970
tray and then it kind of just SAT it

352
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,620
right the reason why it was just sitting

353
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,750
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there was extremely</font>

354
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,600
long delays between when the malware

355
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,090
sample was kind of executed like started

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,210
going into its next stages so if you

357
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,920
kind of in in a ladybug you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

358
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,110
all like the sleep command you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

359
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the references to the windows sleep</font>

360
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,550
command you see here that somebody is

361
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,320
sleeping for like three hundred thousand

362
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,120
milliseconds and that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font>

363
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,330
so when you kind of like stick it inside

364
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,070
of like a sandbox or whatever um the

365
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,300
sandbox is<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz it's gonna run for a</font>

366
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,680
certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time but it's not</font>

367
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,800
going to run forever inside that

368
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,410
environment and maybe the Mauer didn't

369
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,589
do anything interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> until this clock</font>

370
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,339
finally counted down so one of the

371
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,740
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is you can patch the</font>

372
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,470
binary and actually change some of these

373
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:30,440
weights to like much smaller times so

374
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did was I plugged in 200,000 like</font>

375
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,940
two thousand two thousand milliseconds

376
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,890
and replaced some of these very large

377
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,020
values which are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> three hundred</font>

378
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,720
thousand milliseconds that<font color="#CCCCCC"> joins it to</font>

379
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,760
like two seconds and stuff so much

380
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">shorter time and what do you find what</font>

381
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,640
it does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough we're</font>

382
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,230
in a worse situation now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gfx</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> J what it</font>

383
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,630
does is it creates three copies of

384
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,300
itself and places it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desktop so</font>

385
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,490
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not only do we have 1i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GFX</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> J we</font>

386
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,769
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at with three I GFX</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JS we</font>

387
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to look at so exciting fortunately</font>

388
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,579
these I gfx<font color="#E5E5E5"> JS all have the same hash so</font>

389
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:11,319
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only have to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

390
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:14,769
them but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will find is that each</font>

391
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,259
of these IDF x-ray executables um they

392
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,670
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started from like using the CMD</font>

393
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:23,559
command but they all get started with a

394
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:27,099
different flag yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what my</font>

395
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,139
desktop looked like before I ran them

396
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,179
our sample this new patch malware sample

397
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:34,689
and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it looked like</font>

398
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,850
afterwards this is why is this stuff

399
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,149
started getting deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah even the</font>

400
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,980
desktop background started to disappear

401
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you run this inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Windows XP</font>

402
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,709
I guess the background gets rendered a

403
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:49,119
little differently yeah it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously</font>

404
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:53,319
looks like something from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie</font>

405
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:57,540
hacker this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheesy um yeah you</font>

406
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:59,738
soon do you see this a hacked by GOP so

407
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,118
as it turns out it doesn't stand for

408
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:05,319
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican fighting it stands</font>

409
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:08,829
for guardians of peace which yeah

410
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:12,129
betrayed me yeah they're worth commence

411
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so doing some Network</font>

412
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,299
forensics of this executable as it goes

413
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,130
through its different stages is really

414
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,408
helpful to get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of like what kind</font>

415
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,639
of host does this malware contact what

416
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:25,649
kind of ways does it use the kind of

417
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:30,428
propagate so who can guess what this is

418
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:33,699
yeah so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I shouldn't really useful</font>

419
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,889
tool for taking a look at licking a look

420
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,360
at like packing half years is Wireshark

421
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:41,168
you get a great overview of what the

422
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">network data looks like so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

423
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,700
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dust over exe as you can see</font>

424
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,240
it makes lots and lots of connections to

425
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,490
port 445 and 139 like logs just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

426
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,460
filled up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really really crazy loud</font>

427
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,049
and noisy actually so this these

428
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,739
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> are netbios in SMB</font>

429
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:02,418
so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we have a</font>

430
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:06,619
warm here that spreads using Windows

431
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:09,049
File Sharing um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the IP addresses</font>

432
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,879
that it tries the contact and stuff you

433
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,470
can there in plain text it's really

434
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:15,369
really easy to see like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

435
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,720
strings on the binary so like just like

436
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,029
forensics like 101 run strings on your

437
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,009
binary these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just plain text</font>

438
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:27,379
very easy to find hard coded IP

439
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:30,499
addresses and as you find that each<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

440
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:35,029
I GF x ray it tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call home a few</font>

441
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:36,590
times on port 8080 it does that to each

442
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:40,159
of those IP addresses which was

443
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:45,399
statically coded it does that to each IP

444
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:47,090
address three times so yeah

445
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,738
unfortunately these are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

446
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:54,619
request I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the other end of</font>

447
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:58,039
the capture but yeah so final thoughts

448
00:18:54,619 --> 00:19:01,459
um this power sample wasn't really

449
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,289
anything that complicated especially for

450
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,850
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was like written by like</font>

451
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,230
I guess like a government<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

452
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,869
something new is there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

453
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,489
surprising that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was this easy</font>

454
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:11,720
normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladies like take a look at like</font>

455
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:13,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Stuxnet which is</font>

456
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,779
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of line of code and super</font>

457
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,179
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was really really</font>

458
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:19,039
really simple to analyze and I guess the

459
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,470
next thing is yeah the news will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

460
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,059
news it's got like a huge amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hype</font>

461
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,999
and when you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for information</font>

462
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,070
about them our sample you'll see like

463
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:31,070
people describing this as like a super

464
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,928
complex thing that's scary and wiping

465
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,779
things but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it actually</font>

466
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:40,519
works pretty simple it's pretty it

467
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:42,739
operates in a really simple way yeah

468
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,450
someone like with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> freshman but</font>

469
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:46,279
probably like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a freshman who has like</font>

470
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,019
computer programming one experience

471
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,399
probably could have been something

472
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,379
similar right so I guess that's most of

473
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,389
my slides and I'll kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of open it up</font>

474
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:58,879
the questions and there's my contact

475
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:01,449
information so yeah anyone have any

476
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,449
questions for me

477
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:31,530
one thing well yeah your chair hmm well

478
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:36,930
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's hmm yeah that's a really</font>

479
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question I guess well looking fared</font>

480
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,330
like some suspicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby in running an</font>

481
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,890
intrusion detection system I would

482
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine there's rules you can pick up</font>

483
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,150
that would kind of detect when like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

484
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">single machine or whatever is producing</font>

485
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:54,990
that many connections like on using

486
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,280
windows file sharing and stuff so I'm

487
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,280
kind of surprised thinking detective

488
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:08,090
yeah i think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute forcing</font>

489
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,090
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> too yeah</font>

490
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:20,300
really a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> say right cool um I</font>

491
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,300
guess that's all I am for the talk
