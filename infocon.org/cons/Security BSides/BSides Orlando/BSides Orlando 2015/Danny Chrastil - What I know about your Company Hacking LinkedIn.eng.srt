87
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,239
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I drop web dev like a bad habit and</font>

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,500

98
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,380
which is scripting a lot of stuff which

99
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,150
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on reconnaissance so that's</font>

100
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,700
kind of been my focus for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

101
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,859
so it's been a fun thing to focus on and

102
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,690
if you were in at<font color="#CCCCCC"> jonathan's talk just</font>

104
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,710
was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> like reconnaissance is</font>

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,000

108
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,660
his statement there because it is

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,560
awesome but a lot of us if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,600
boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tedious and check marked of</font>

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,780
just what we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for our pen test</font>

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:13,820

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,660
recon is like such an awesome part

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,940
because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that step you need</font>

117
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,120
to be able to perform an even better

118
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,770
test and if you're not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then</font>

126
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,730
findings all that kind of stuff and we

127
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,770
don't pay attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um so what</font>

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,128
different types we have like business

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,469
intelligence so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

144
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,080
this is my target competitor and I want

145
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:32,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out who they're selling to</font>

146
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,169
because that's who I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to target i</font>

147
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,789
may try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal business from them you</font>

148
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,729
know there's one perspective of business

149
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,919
Intel but really figuring out what this

150
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,628
company does you know what's sensitive

151
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,128
to them what information am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,580
try to hack and what am I going to try

153
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal from them so then other things</font>

154
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,229
like okay well do these guys have like

155
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,419
uniform email formats like it's always

156
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,159
first name dot last name it said company

157
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,049
com you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all the business</font>

158
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,360
until you're going to gather then we

159
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,149
have network mapping so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

160
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> n map go learn n map that's you</font>

161
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,709
know basic for our network mapping but

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't do that unless you've</font>

163
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,879
already gotten what IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses belong</font>

164
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,709
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target right so if you don't know</font>

165
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some recon to</font>

166
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:19,019
figure out what IP space is do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

167
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,699
guys own um now DNS recon<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

168
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,219
let's see you know what domain names

169
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,749
through these guys own what kind of name

170
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:28,110
service do they own their own name

171
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:29,699
servers do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a wreck or MX</font>

172
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,439
records that are pointed like exchange

173
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,579
servers so now they're using exchange

174
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,380
email that's some dns recon and then

175
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:40,468
fingerprinting so now we have like huge

176
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">list of IP addresses we have you know</font>

177
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,740
domains all this kind of stuff what's

178
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,719
fingerprinting let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

179
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,300
applications are running on those are

180
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,100
the CMS is do they have e-commerce what

181
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,889
kind of like libraries are they using is

182
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">it jquery etc you know with our IP</font>

183
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,120
address is what what IP addresses are

184
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,480
responding in those ranges what's on

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,220
those porks what you know what software

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,310
and what versions running on those ports

187
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,829
and so forth so that's our recon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

188
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,060
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here to a few tools</font>

189
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,769
that I like um you're my video go a few

190
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,479
tools that I like and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

191
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how this tedious stuff could really</font>

192
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,649
be cool um so I ran if you haven't seen

193
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,079
this before this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your american</font>

194
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,050
registry for internet numbers basically

195
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,180
a fancy way of just logging IP addresses

196
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,279
for a public record of IP addresses for

197
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,779
companies so if I target hewlett-packard

198
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,960
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of stuff</font>

199
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could click on one</font>

200
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,100
you know they have network resources and

201
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,470
if we go into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network resource</font>

202
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,890
you'll see oh here's an IP range that

203
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,740
they own cool let's add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to our file</font>

204
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,199
for doing recon well let's do like Sony

205
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,060
you know we like to pick on Sony so

206
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,400
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some IP addresses for sony let's</font>

207
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,500
open up this customer record and network

208
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,300
resource right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got some</font>

209
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">more but the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's usually</font>

210
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,800
tons of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we don't want to</font>

211
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through each one and be like</font>

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,089
okay I got a copy that and paste it to

213
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,130
our notepad or whatever you're using so

214
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,670
how about we automate it how about I

215

219
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,110
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like Python so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

220
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,730
IP ranges which has a few arguments here

221
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,890
we have or guy d and like a pattern to

222
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,310
check it right so we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

223

ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll put in my hpi</font>

224
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,729
9233 but it doesn't matter and then

225
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">hewitt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for my pattern to match so it's</font>

228
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a huge list of all these IP</font>

229
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,930
addresses that are on the air in record

230
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,710
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are actually owned by</font>

HP so cute with some large blocks as

232
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,000
well so like now we have a whole bunch

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data what we got in a matter of</font>

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,440
seconds or a minute or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and could</font>

235
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,940
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into nmap you know throw that</font>

236
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,650
into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nessus scanner you know now</font>

237
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have some real data to start working</font>

238
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">with here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so who is</font>

239
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,220
this is basic right so we'll start<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

240
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,260
with a little who is search let's do a

241
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,240
who is on HP com and see what comes up

242
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so here's their whois record and</font>

243
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,340
they own their own name servers believe

244
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,920
it or not um so let's take their name

245
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,440
servers right and go to this cool

246
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,099
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this is G web tools and</font>

247
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,310
there's tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the place</font>

248
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,180
but this is one that I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and</font>

249
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,550
specifically they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing called</font>

250
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,420
name server spa so they have their own

251
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,269
database where they record

252
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,490
all these domains that belong to

253
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:50,790
specific name servers so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

254
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,760
search here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for NS 1 HP com let's see</font>

255
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,790
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get all right we have fifteen</font>

256
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,800
hundred and ten domains that are under

257
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:02,459
that name server and so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

258
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot in a lot of pages so 13 it</font>

259
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:09,380
just keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and I do not want to</font>

260
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,810
copy and paste the domains off of this

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,939
this tool so there's 61 pages so that's

262
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,680
where as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed and so how are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

263
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get I mean they have an API you</font>

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,000
could pay to use their API but I mean

265
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,920
we're hackers and if we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,350
every tool we use we're going to be

267
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,519
broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so let's figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

268
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:32,130
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> without so I have a another tool</font>

269
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,350
here and this is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Python so we</font>

270
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:39,269
have our G web scraper<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so all we</font>

271
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,360
have to pass in is our name server and

272
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:48,149
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many pages were in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the results so</font>

273
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:51,000
let's do this I may do NS 1 HP com I'm

274
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do name servers and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aswan by HP</font>

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,860
com and I know that the pages are 61 so

276
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,470
hit enter there we go fifteen hundred

277
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,310
and ten domain names that have at one

278
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,690
point been under the ns1 HP com name

279
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,949
server and yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

280
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,100
some few false positives in there

281
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,689
because this isn't always up to date or

282
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,540
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be old records but this is</font>

283
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,910
some great information right all right

284
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show one more and this</font>

285
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,839
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar so what if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't</font>

286
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,730
have a their own name server<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so HP</font>

287
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,769
com I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again it does</font>

288
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,060
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own name server but what</font>

289
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">other kind of informations on their</font>

290
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,599
whois record that we could use hmm how

291
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,279
about we look for well the problem is

292
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,660
say if they have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a godaddy one or</font>

293
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,920
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> rackspace or something like that</font>

294
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,959
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a whole bunch of crap</font>

295
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,579
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really want so how about their</font>

296
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,060
email address right so this is

297
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:50,349
registered with HP domains at HP com and

298
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,248
here's the phone number that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

299
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,290
registered well web or calm has a sweet

300
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,959
look up where you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up domains</font>

301
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,269
based on the registers contact name the

302
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,998
registers contact email or their phone

303
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:10,300
number so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just plug in my HP</font>

304
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:12,399
domains in HP com we get 2111 domains

305
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">now it sounds like some good recon for</font>

306
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,670
me but I again do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

307
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,709
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these pages and have to copy and</font>

308
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,670
paste or pay to use their<font color="#E5E5E5"> API to get</font>

309
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:27,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from them so we have a</font>

310
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,748
script for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and it's</font>

311
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,360
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the other ones we just</font>

312
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:35,040
want to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an idea this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so web or</font>

313
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,709
scraper and we have one argument email

314
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,519
so let's go ahead and push this through

315
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:48,489
Python web<font color="#E5E5E5"> or scraper email and HP</font>

316
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:50,170
domains at HP com but that run this

317
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't edited this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it take</font>

318
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:56,560
really actually not spam

319
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,310
oh there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's not long</font>

320
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,529
for 2111 domain names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cross that</font>

321
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,779
check out with the previous one but the

322
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:07,300
point is now with a few simple scripts

323
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,310
in a matter of minutes we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of IP</font>

324
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,170
ranges we've got tons of domain names

325
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,709
and now we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that to do some</font>

326
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,199
real stuff to look into you know what

327
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:24,040
services they have what kind of web web

328
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,390
sites are on those etc oh here we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

329
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings us to linked in</font>

330
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,519
which is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main part of our talk</font>

331
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,950
here so LinkedIn is like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> monster of</font>

332
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,990
business intelligence they have so much

333
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:40,240
data and it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you could do</font>

334
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:42,220
um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you could you get a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

335
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,769
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

336
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,390
to scrape their site LinkedIn is very

337
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,640
particular they don't they don't want to

338
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,000
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data with you so they have</font>

339
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,890
some layers of protection that they put

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really call it</font>

341
00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:00,790
protection please um but there were some

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,350
obstacles so what I did is I was doing

343
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,890
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> research on figuring out how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

344
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,029
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information off of LinkedIn and</font>

345
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,510
these were coming some of the obstacles

346
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,820
that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up one they have third-degree</font>

347
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,310
redactions that means if anybody outside

348
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,240
of your network is either a third or

349
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus 2 3rd + degree not and you just say</font>

350
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,769
do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search looking for Danny and</font>

351
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,290
HP and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not connected to me in any</font>

352
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:27,880
way my profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be redacted</font>

353
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,050
it's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very short you're just</font>

354
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,480
going to have some basic information

355
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,609
you're not going to see like a lot of my

356
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,070
past experience and my skill set those

357
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,449
kinds of things so that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of comes</font>

358
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,730
into play when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an automated</font>

359
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,260
tool to try to scrape data because you

360
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,079
most the time you're not maintaining a

361
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,120
session but that is something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

362
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,890
so the other thing they do is our

363
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,320
traffic restrictions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

364
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,850
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you got a throttle on your</font>

365
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,670
they'll terminate your sessions and

366
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,700
they'll walk

367
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,709
your account so of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got to</font>

368
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,420
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get past these the</font>

369
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,150
third degree reduction it's actually

370
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cool they do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing if you do</font>

371
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,619
a search on their site if you do a

372
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,950
search like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did earlier for a company</font>

373
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,780
and say a sales title or something well

374
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,790
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is that behind the scenes</font>

375
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,129
they kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time</font>

376
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,990
off token for you to view that profile

377
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">make threw it in the hyperlink okay so</font>

378
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,589
that off token is what's going to allow

379
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,940
you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> view that page otherwise you</font>

380
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,369
won't be able to see these third degree

381
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,890
connections so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could capture that</font>

382
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,469
off token then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in our</font>

383
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,990
scraping<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now traffic</font>

384
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,790
restrictions throttle session

385
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,470
termination they'll randomly there isn't

386
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set pattern to it but sometimes</font>

387
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,960
they'll just terminate your session if

388
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,630
you're doing too much um so you'll see

389
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,790
later i wrote a function in there that's

390
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,650
looking for a session termination if

391
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,180
they terminate it automatically just

392
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,520
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> thick it real quick and give you a</font>

393
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,080
new session cookie so it just continues

394
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,360
its flow with that without being

395
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,240
interrupted and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one is account</font>

396
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,590
walk out now figuring out the threshold

397
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,860
for account lockout was interesting

398
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,600
because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i had my test account</font>

399
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,439
locked maybe about three or four times

400
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,240
and added send a messaging that you it's

401
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,920
not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five-minute lockout or</font>

402
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,750
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to send a</font>

403
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,610
message in and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first person wrote</font>

404
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,040
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there left you are not allowed</font>

405
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party tools to scrape data</font>

406
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,149
our site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to send in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

407
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,399
driver's license and birth certificate

408
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff I'm my god so I sent</font>

409
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,900
in another request another person

410
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,540
responds and they're like oh did you

411
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,160
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using a public computer and</font>

412
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,159
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Who am I right back to this</font>

413
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,770
person I was like yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I was at</font>

414
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,050
the library and i think i left my

415
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,870
session open and i think somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

416
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,149
took over my session no like oh don't

417
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about it that happens here's a new</font>

418
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,100

419
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,040

420
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,360
three times so it's not really there's

421
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,060
ways to get around that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you</font>

422
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,379
figure out that that point where you're

423
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">not getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account locked</font>

424
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,950
that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing you could</font>

425
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,590
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done to to avoid some of</font>

426
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,930
the traffic restrictions is uh I put a

427
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,550
list of different proxies I could use so

428
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,040
because they'll block just my IP address

429
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,470
and so if I logged into my account from

430
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,450
a different IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so like if</font>

431
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,550
you could do a list of proxies now put

432
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the script it's where it'll kind</font>

433
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cycle through them but all the proxes</font>

434
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,940
i use were like free proxies and they're

435
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow and so I was like that I'll</font>

436
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:36,380
just throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my traffic for now but</font>

437
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,900
that is fun so what I'm going to do you

438
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,450
know it's debating let's do this i'm not

439
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to do my video i'll just open up</font>

440
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,480
linkedin because i have internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

441
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if we do a search and I showed</font>

442
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,660
this at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of you</font>

443
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:55,670
who missed it you could do a search

444
00:19:50,660 --> 00:20:00,650
let's say let's look for Hewlett let's

445
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:05,720
do HP fortify on demand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we'll</font>

446
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:08,540
we'll do security people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's</font>

447
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,610
only two really much more than if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a</font>

448
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,899
search here so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give us a</font>

449
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:16,370
list I didn't type it in right it's

450
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us a list of people and</font>

451
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:25,010
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> um that if I click on them up</font>

452
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,620
here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh authentication type out</font>

453
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,450
of network and here's your auth token so

454
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,979
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the off token that we want to</font>

455
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,830
steal to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view these full</font>

456
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,810
profiles now what kind of data do we

457
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,179
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get off linkedin there's there's</font>

458
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,790
tons of data and what I targeted

459
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,040
specifically for this tool was trying to

460
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,260
extrapolate what somebody's network is

461
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,389
because LinkedIn won't tell you oh these

462
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,390
are all the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jane is</font>

463
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,960
connected to they may say you have some

464
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in common all right here um</font>

465
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I mean they have some people</font>

466
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,050
in common but they're not going to tell

467
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you who their whole network is so how</font>

468
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,560
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that because what if we were</font>

469
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,169
doing that scenario we're like let's

470
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,639
let's pick our competitor and we're

471
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,890
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> target their sales people and</font>

472
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,990
see who they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all connected to and</font>

473
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,490
they have a theme of common people

474
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,080
they're connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe that's one of</font>

475
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,420
their clients you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

476
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,760
extrapolate data like that well how can

477
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,340
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well there's a little feature</font>

478
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,610
linkedin<font color="#E5E5E5"> add it in a while ago which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

479
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,350
awesome skills endorsements right so you

480
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,990
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> list skills and people can endorse</font>

481
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,389
you so yeah person has that skill well

482
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,120
now only people within your network can

483
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,830
endorse you so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is data that</font>

484
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,169
is scrape above people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are within</font>

485
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,899
their network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jane has a pretty poor</font>

486
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:46,220
profile I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> junior has probably a</font>

487
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:49,700
better one hopefully oh yeah Jake jr.

488
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,330
has more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extract I</font>

489
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,800
could go scrape all these people and

490
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,080
extrapolate you know here's a network

491
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,909
that belongs to junior<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I do this</font>

492
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,250
for a hundred sales rep so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

493
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,050
have some good data to compare so we

494
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,300
went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran this tool I'm gonna</font>

495
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,629
actually i'll do a demo first so let's

496
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,600
do anybody else have oh wait let's do

497
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:16,640
something fun like like Lockheed Martin

498
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:20,110
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so let's do an advanced</font>

499
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:28,200
search Lockheed Martin as the company

500
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:32,549
current and let's say security<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

501
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,590
so we'll grab this do search<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

502
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:36,029
so here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> our results now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

503
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you the tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I may try to zoom</font>

504
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:42,120
in here so we could see it better<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hate</font>

505
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:46,168

509
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:59,519
gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the profiles we're going to</font>

559
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,360
now it's extracting all the endorsements

560
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,179
from her page so now we're getting some

561
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,669
good information so what do we do with

562
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,130

573
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,530

574
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,090
version kind of sucks um you have

575
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,760
awesome transforms which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

576
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">modules to do recon but just the mapping</font>

577
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,379
is invaluable so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go ahead</font>

578
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,409
and import the data from this linkedin

579
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:35,080
so I have a couple files and I'm going

580
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:37,790
to pull some other ones off my vm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 220hp</font>

581
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:44,629
profiles yeah i'll do i'll stick with HP

582
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:46,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do HP profiles and so</font>

583
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,500
these are all our columns<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

584
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">head assign this as a person so if</font>

585
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,760
you've used melts ego<font color="#E5E5E5"> this probably all</font>

586
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,070
makes sense if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it it you can</font>

587
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,320
map data to different kind of nodes and

588
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,950
it does different tasks based on what

589
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of note it is so this was their</font>

590
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:08,690
skill so I'll just go ahead and say this

591
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:13,340
is like there's different things we

592
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:16,520
could do person URL I'll just do an

593
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:22,970
affiliation I guess and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

594
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:25,300
another person I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them as a person</font>

595
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,280
is 10 I like doing this relations and

596
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,760
then this is their title and their

597
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:36,080
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually yeah what I'll do is</font>

598
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:37,430
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac this column I may do their</font>

599
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,899
company because I want to see who these

600
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,240
people are connected to as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

601
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:47,090
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications very expert ok</font>

602
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,410
here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies so here we go I</font>

603
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,409
will import this data

604
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:05,160
and it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> its magic we get to switch</font>

605
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,530
to bubble you all right so it makes

606
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,700
these really cool grass which even if

607
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,139
you don't get anything out of them they

608
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,800
look cool and you make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your</font>

609
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:19,260
wallpaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set but if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font>

610
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:21,840
data here so we have so the orange are

611
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,780
our original people so the orange people

612
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,699
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> fod and all the green things are the</font>

613
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that they're associated with so</font>

614
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,760
the bigger the circle the more people

615
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,670
are associated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and this is</font>

616
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:38,940
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blank by them so I usually</font>

617
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:42,630
delete that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now we could look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

618
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,710
things and say okay HP fortify on demand

619
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,170
we know that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

620
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,270
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that troubleshooting these</font>

621
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:52,470
are like different skills but I could go

622
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:54,200
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see who's all selected for</font>

623
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,010
networking so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could see under</font>

624
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,530
troubleshooting all these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

625
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,560
connected but what I'll do I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

626
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it actually without the skill data so</font>

627
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:10,100
import this again HP profiles I may do

628
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:22,379
a person and their affiliation as their

629
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:22,379
skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

630
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,360
you do endless combinations i'm just

631
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,399
showing a few here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want to</font>

632
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">get an idea of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stuff we</font>

633
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,470
have out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now this is</font>

634
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,480
skill sets<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now we have people</font>

635
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,640
who work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fortify on demand and their</font>

636
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,470
skill sets they have in common<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

637
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,690
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this one testing so we know</font>

638
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,610
those people of testing these people

639
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:49,600
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> management well what if one of</font>

640
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,760
these said like burp suite which one of

641
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,129
them may well now we could see you know

642
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well HP fortify on-demand uses burp</font>

643
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,790
suite for their testing which isn't

644
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:01,240
really that unheard of but let's say we

645
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,100
did the tech company for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lockheed Martin</font>

646
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,740
and they have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> barracuda firewalls</font>

647
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well maybe all these security IT</font>

648
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,370
people are working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls at</font>

649
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,440
Lockheed Martin are from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barracuda you</font>

650
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,750
know we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that kind of data well</font>

651
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,040
let's do this i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to import one</font>

657
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,740
it's probably done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so we have</font>

658
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:49,980
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lockheed martin let me pull that</font>

661
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead and import a lockheed martin</font>

662
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:11,039
profiles so here's all of our we did I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font>

663
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:13,760
is that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I we did sales ok but</font>

664
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll still do</font>

665
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,050
fish

666
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:35,170
ok so we're different crafts here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

667
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:38,439
get rid of our blank record here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

668
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:39,820
so let's look at this data here we have

669
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,730
there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of overlap between</font>

670
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,970
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people surprisingly we have one</font>

671
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,340
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very exciting so Joyce is</font>

672
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,560
connected to to these other people which

673
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,449
unfortunately that wasn't as excited as

674
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:57,690
I really want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be but let's see</font>

675
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,690
here

676
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,620
ok then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give this</font>

677
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:11,880
welcome Martin we have a person all

678
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,880
right we'll grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

679
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:19,039
it is and then

680
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,620
yeah we'll do this one

681
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:39,889
okay so now we see a little bit more

682
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:42,500
trends here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our sale these</font>

683
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:45,710
are tech people from Lockheed Martin and

684
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,510
the different skills that they have in

685
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,670
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> so another way we could look at</font>

686
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,980
this is we could sort by wait to see

687
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:55,880
which ones have the most if you guys

688
00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:01,840
still see this or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

689
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,840
let's zoom in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little or incoming</font>

690
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here we go here's all the skills</font>

691
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,990
that they have the most most common

692
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,710
together so they have network security

693
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:19,480
information security miss etc and so we

694
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,740
basically got their<font color="#CCCCCC"> skill set from their</font>

695
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,350
profile and that's what i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

696
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,400
here so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we'd see like okay</font>

697
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,370
well if they have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common</font>

698
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,740
look they all have vmware experience

699
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,540
again that's not a big given or that's

700
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,610
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big surprise but let's say you</font>

701
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,500
know we could say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of security</font>

702
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,149
people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> lockheed martin using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vmware</font>

703
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,680
now you could use their imagination to

704
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,960
see how that could lead to more and more

705
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,700
information that you get and we only got

706
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,040
to do like six people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from lockheed</font>

707
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">martin but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we have a sales force team</font>

708
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,420
of a hundred people we download all of

709
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,399
their data all their connections and we

710
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,280
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> see who's connected to who this</font>

711
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,660
person is like we have dip you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

712
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,399
different sales people that are all

713
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:02,410
connected to you know xcel energy com

714
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,970
well okay I guess that companies most

715
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,870
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing business with Xcel Energy</font>

716
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:09,340
com so that's where a lot of this data

717
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,710
kind of comes into play and becomes

718
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,500
useful and now we've bypassed a lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">LinkedIn's protection in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain</font>

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:23,530
from their site<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really unlimited it's</font>

722
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,270
just basically what can we find and how

723
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,919
do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and in this case it</font>

724
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,320
was no extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and their skills</font>

725
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,690
but it really could be anything else so

726
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I went ahead and took the code and put</font>

727
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,220
it up on github here so if anybody is

728
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in it you could go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it it's just called linkedin gather</font>

730
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,980

732
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,168
gosh this code is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sloppy because it</font>

733
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,139
probably is um but it is a work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

739
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,320
that's the presentation any questions

740
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,009
doing automated footprint so that kind

741
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you were talking about but</font>

742
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,809
turning it into a report like here's the

firewalls your brand's ooh I see that

746
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,290
that's using the endorsements but what

747
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:46,150
other people's profiles where's like I

748
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:48,130
have experience right it's it is just a

749
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,589
matter of what you're pulling off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

750
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">LinkedIn profile right so if you get</font>

751
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:54,250
that data then yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

752
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,190
into your map and get that heat map and

753
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,250
unfortunately the data I had wasn't as

754
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,180
big as I wanted it to be because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

755
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:05,230
throttled my account right there at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

756
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,868
end but yes you can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what I do a</font>

757
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,030
little bit more further for my job is

758
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,650
doing like fingerprints of companies

759
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,260
like the steps we're talking about

760
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting IP address is getting domain</font>

761
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,730
names through DNS fingerprinting those

762
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,920
and getting all that together thrown it

763
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,020
into melty go get this huge heat map and

764
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,730
build this report for a client by<font color="#CCCCCC"> K</font>

765
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's all the stuff we found you know</font>

766
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,359
that's a very powerful you no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

767
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:31,030
could use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on top of it you could</font>

768
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,799
say here's your Salesforce and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

all this kind of information or here's

770
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,520
your IT team and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this kind of</font>

771
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,470
information and you could use that now

772
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,780
you get used a linkedin scraper to pull

773
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,279
all this date off where before it wasn't

774
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,990
so easy they've made a lot of changes to

775
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure they'll continue</font>

776
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:49,359
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it but yeah you really could</font>

777
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,780
get any information you want from those

778
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,779
profiles

779
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,650
oh yeah yeah so they answered Mary yeah

780
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,660
you could you could pull because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

781
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,270
getting an HTML response right and it

782
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,790
has a full profile and LinkedIn is very

783
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,259
nice to where they actually you don't

784
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do a lot of scraping because</font>

785
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,850
they take the whole profile and they

786
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,100
load it into JSON dump and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

787
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,589
commented out so if you view source

788
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,170
there's this like commented it out JSON

789
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,450
dump and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like oh all red X</font>

790
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,370
match that and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consumed the</font>

791
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,990
JSON object and it's all sorted in a

792
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,690
pretty object you know you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

793
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:31,529
do a lot of scraping so it's really neat

794
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,610
how they they ended up doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for us</font>

795
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,740
but yeah you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab anything you</font>

796
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:37,900
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab that whole JSON dump save it</font>

797
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then later access whatever data you</font>

798
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,160
want yeah

799
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:52,538
