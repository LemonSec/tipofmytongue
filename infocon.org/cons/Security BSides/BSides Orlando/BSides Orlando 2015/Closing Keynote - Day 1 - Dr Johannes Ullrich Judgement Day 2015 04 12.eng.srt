00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,090
first experiment security was back then

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,180
I was still doing physics and setting up

I set up a little fireball next and then

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next security experience sort of</font>

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:28,679
came up I'm getting attacked by anybody

28

chinese russian me why so one of the

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,619
questions I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer being a</font>

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,770
physicist you always want to collect

<font color="#CCCCCC">this heat shield system which</font>

00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,219
precursor of that incident store or

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,770
we'll talk about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little</font>

40
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,520
bit later into the talk what this

41
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,619
actually does and how it all works and

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,970
what thing to do but let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

43

Judgment Day so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what's the problem</font>

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:15,890
what's the premise of Judgment Day yes I

52
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:40,670
love talk about two aspects one is sort

so not in it what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of these</font>

110
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:29,670
devices smokin X cameras security be

so these things that we surround<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

122
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,219
are new threats up if you think about it

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,100
is traffic on a certain stretch of road

or not so by networking goes LED

streetlights with your traffic lights

149
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:27,070
you get another twenty thirty percent in

168
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,310
comes down to it is internet or face

169
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,419
what is it cracked it from Cisco and

170
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,640
just talk in enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it's really</font>

171
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,050
very different internet than we

172
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,049
originally designed

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:43,110
I'm back years of 70 80 to yak one big

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
computer names are using mobile

175
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,060
computing back and involves the fourth

176
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,220
left so they're hitting from today here

177
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:57,150
I'm computer on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your right now probably</font>

178
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:02,520
really matter yes tablet phone maybe

179
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:04,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch so a laptop so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

180
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,829
very much and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing we soon</font>

181
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,050
enough right now it's a three computers

182
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,970
per person is not unreasonable probably

183
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,719
for the crowd here it's more like five

184
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,820
or six per person right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now on you so in</font>

185
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:23,130
it with that maybe also to think a

186
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:25,380
little bit about different protocols the

187
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">less important it was not really</font>

188
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:33,330
designed for that many systems mobile

189
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,150
computing all that so ipv6 that's for

190

just put them in as the light bulb is

225
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,819
built<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we put the same key into</font>

00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:12,248
ways of how it works one things are you

296
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,779
driving ourselves that let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me receive</font>

297
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:16,689
something they tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it around</font>

298
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:20,410
and post something about it really fast

299
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:22,689
it's not assert or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

300
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,399
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're sure so great organization</font>

301
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:27,370
of what they do it is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a new</font>

302
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,040
vulnerability their research it and then

303
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,069
publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it published a detailed my</font>

306
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,240
knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

307
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,009
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will report back and</font>

308
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,230
tell us more about it and that's a

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit the power of it that's or how</font>

310
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,319
it works best now sometimes we sort of

311
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:53,529
have these write ups<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooler just there</font>

335
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,780
build up a better database and anyway so

336
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:02,630
how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll start let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

337
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:05,700
into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this phone call is keen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bio me</font>

338
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay weird stuff added to my you mean I</font>

339
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:17,130
heard so he was telling us that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives</font>

340
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">his router for his customers and all</font>

341
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:24,230
four seconds those linksys routers spit

342
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">out a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ton of traffic on port 80 and 88</font>

343
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,130
now he isolated to the linksys router

344
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,990
like initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> he wasn't sure is it a</font>

345
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,150
computer connected to router or

346
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,160
something like this like a one common

347
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,790
issue these days is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV got infected</font>

348
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,160
so you should turn off the computer and

349
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:44,030
traffic keeps going

350
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,240
let's probably TBS probably smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV but</font>

351
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,170
he had to disconnect everything turn off

352
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi and these routers cat on stay</font>

353
00:17:51,170 --> 00:18:00,890
on track once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> rebooted a router stop</font>

354
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again no you have is five</font>

355
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,310
all database so we went in a check and

356
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,000
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> here problem everybody's very</font>

357
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:13,070
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty all the time anyway</font>

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,010
that's really hard to sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see it see</font>

359
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:20,000
a significant uptick here in in traffic

360
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,830
on on port 80 or EA so Daddy help us too

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,140
much but I mentioned earlier we also

362
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:28,220
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> locks and never pretty neat</font>

363
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">honey pot actually is P</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Europe sends</font>

364
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,190
us all of your unused IP address

365
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,800
basically when a personal investment

366
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:39,560
unused IP address is ending up in her

367
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:45,500
honey pot and and we saw this beard

368
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:48,810
request sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> H naught 1</font>

369
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,330
it's a protocol that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is peace you is to</font>

370
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:54,090
manage routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something ellipses</font>

371
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,550
put something routers that and I see you

372
00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,120
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own money Karen remote or</font>

373
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,320
thicker their mothers Frank's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are right</font>

374
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,090
up a little bit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there were some</font>

375
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,980
old vulnerabilities in this but I've got

376
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">all those routers that what happens when</font>

377
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:16,110
u Zen is hmm 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> this router well it</font>

378
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,720
returns an XML document with all the

379
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,209
videos about a router first being used

380
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,070
but model you have at some point it also

381
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,950
to be more helpful we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass</font>

382
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:30,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">port on the router and they turned that</font>

383
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:32,910
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some reason but anyway so if you</font>

384
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,000
got crate everything is someone is

385
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,310
broadening our honey pot<font color="#E5E5E5"> or these</font>

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,180
brothers so I set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that page whenever</font>

387
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,629
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> send an H nap one it returned</font>

388
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:49,680
the page<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is one robbery at around</font>

389
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:53,600
and then just had the next thing they

390
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,530
said well they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to access this URL</font>

391
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,959
interesting

392
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on here so from updating</font>

393
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,050
or a policy okay you see this you see

394
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,510
this request only knows anything about

395
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,110
it what computed in both of us they used

396
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,620
authentication and this is based on the

397
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:16,110
case you can easily revert this password

398
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,550
it's a username admin and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex</font>

399
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:23,669
password it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means the default password</font>

400
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:28,250
before that there's some hidden password

401
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:32,310
in there for maintenance purposes now

402
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:35,160
they didn't we use the same so it was

403
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">feared to be posted it and the guide</font>

404
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">will didn't mmm just when you post</font>

405
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,469
interestingly are just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks</font>

406
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,770
ago reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> to balcony tones linksys</font>

407
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,800
now but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a problem of this PM</font>

408
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">unblock first of all it doesn't matter</font>

409
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,840
what password you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send all passwords for</font>

410
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,840
you don't have to send the password

411
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,029
suddenly

412
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,389
there's a operate code execution

413
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:07,669
vulnerability here<font color="#E5E5E5"> team on look I'm ATM</font>

414
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,110
stands for Trend Micro it's a security

415
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:13,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">feature in the router to allow you to</font>

416
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:15,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs and such so that's correct</font>

417
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:20,059
all you have to do is is if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

418
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,419
your child comments it's a post and it

419
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:27,019
will be executed and indeed that's what

420
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,669
we saw with these routers they saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

421
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's we sort of took what the</font>

422
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:34,009
Maverick card what's something we called

423
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,719
the moon born because it use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a</font>

million movie it's a bad movie but the

425
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,509
movie called moon sort of so who's

426
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,320
Arthur from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> psychology so</font>

427
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:50,179
in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> well first of all one thing we</font>

428
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,200
found looks very typical with a dinner

429
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:57,470
of things stuff these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices it's not</font>

430
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,330
as easy to do your reverse analysis as

431
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,289
it is with the windows malware you're

432
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,149
used to for windows malware club all

433
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:08,029
kinds of instrumentation you especially

434
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:10,850
configured virtual images massage there

435
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,879
that you can do use food to run an hour

436
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:20,559
see buddy does load it up debuggers all

437
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:24,759
that good stuff this one runs on our mix

438
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,259
the era just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> MIPS unique you emo</font>

439
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,289
which is sort of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> where fascination</font>

440
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:31,090
environment it does mix but then the

441
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,070
standard router firmware doesn't

442
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,749
necessarily run because it expects an

443
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,330
uncertain hardware components like

444
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wireless are without them it doesn't</font>

445
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:43,480
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> run of emulating that is a</font>

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:46,029
pain luckily the sprout is were

447
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,759
vulnerable and but this world ability

448
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:51,669
was also possible to turn on the planet

449
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:55,419
sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor our and then you could just</font>

00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:58,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">login and you just watch another running</font>

452
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:10,509
realize what the number is doing well

453
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:14,809
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> most is never doing this never was</font>

454
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:18,499
actually trying to mine bitcoin

455
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:23,570
and you'll get back to that later so

456
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:26,779
anyway what's next the next thing we saw

457
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,600
can actually some or<font color="#E5E5E5"> D shield system and</font>

458
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:32,659
so on we are big increase in the scans

459
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,259
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 thousand not for its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

461
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:40,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a number of bet based admin</font>

462
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,460
interface and such that like to listen

463
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:46,340
on port<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5000 if it didn't really know</font>

464
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,799
where does it come from because it is

465
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:52,999
anybody sees it but the den particular

466
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,570
one is people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who sent that ran in your</font>

467
00:23:52,999 --> 00:24:02,119
network scanning for<font color="#E5E5E5"> port 5001 it is</font>

468
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:05,119
what what was it DD ours in particularly

469
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,970
its are these little security camera DVR

470
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,850
so I'm not your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kibo but you probably</font>

471
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,710
see them at walmart such ease security

472
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:16,699
cameras<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put around your house and you</font>

473
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:18,740
all go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> such</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little dbr1 set</font>

474
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,759
DVR well it's a hard disk in analytic

475
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,879
system that's really what it is so in it

476
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:30,529
what does the exploit be used default

477
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:33,918
password route and one two three four

478
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:36,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">five I'm not sure this qualifies as next</font>

479
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,580
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just blow again</font>

480
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,899
and the tricky part here I got myself

481
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,510
one of those when you buy them it's a

482
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">little white box in this case and the</font>

483
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:53,799
moss and then has an on-screen keyboard

484
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:56,529
which is numeric keyboard and so really

485
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,179
you can almost owner only<font color="#E5E5E5"> entered in</font>

486
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:01,870
your numeric password I'll sure it is in

487
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:04,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">this happen but anyway once DVI was</font>

488
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:08,010
compromised again it put a Bitcoin miner

489
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got sort of standard practice but</font>

490
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:15,158
then it started scanning for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 thousand</font>

491
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,799
and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular looked for was</font>

492
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:21,520
another device if I familiar with

493
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:25,059
synology these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network this storage</font>

494
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,549
devices all of them have fun web apps

495
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:30,070
installed on them and I don't want to

496
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:34,230
just hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on synology no qnap or whatever</font>

497
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:38,110
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar problems here it just was</font>

498
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,480
explored so on a larger scale so here's

499
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:44,830
just the admin interface for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

500
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:48,460
particular DVR I just married before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

501
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:50,049
find a little yellow thingy up there if

502
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,630
you click on the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two or three</font>

503
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:55,510
you get actually in<font color="#E5E5E5"> full out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> America</font>

504
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">board but you have to sort of taking it</font>

505
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,210
out on yourself there's also at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

506
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:05,230
this version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fairer no way to</font>

507
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:07,450
turn off the telnet server and you can

508
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,330
turn off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP HBS there are all</font>

509
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,190
kinds of stuff to change ports on that

510
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,779
but you cannot turn off the telnet

511
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,580
server that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've changed</font>

512
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,919
nothing to talk to them so the newer

513
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,899
version the talent server is disabled by

514
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,620
default and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspects you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

515
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:25,989
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on if you insist on but and you</font>

516
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,668
can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your password but here strong</font>

517
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,389
passwords is for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can't do</font>

518
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:40,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the respond sir</font>

519
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:42,289
so anyway yeah so how about saying it's

520
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:45,049
still a challenge or not is a shower

521
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:52,039
that encryption stuff is it broken

522
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:54,200
anyway it's made complicated actually

523
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:56,658
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of almost funny the Bitcoin miner</font>

524
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,549
they had on this and be posted in me

525
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,039
posted i someone was setting up actually

526
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:04,668
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter account and we just hey</font>

527
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,859
it's us BR owning that with coin landed

528
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,200
it was a light corn<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy my name</font>

529
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:11,928
partner and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave us access to their</font>

530
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">back-end like how many systems they had</font>

531
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:17,509
infected before I shut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and how</font>

532
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,159
many litecoin stay mind I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I'm</font>

533
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:21,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">roughly added up i think was about two</font>

534
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,869
bucks worth

535
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,149
so that's not necessarily you know why

536
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:31,529
you run sort of a big novel operation

537
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:32,998
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after it was</font>

538
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,919
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> districts the other group because</font>

539
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:37,169
like with any vulnerable device after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

540
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,409
while and find like multiple pieces of

541
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:43,559
matter on there and sort of luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

542
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,479
luckily once you log into the device is

543
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:48,359
actually still hard to change your

544
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:51,119
password the password command usually

545
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:53,309
use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux is missing from that system</font>

546
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,970
you have to manually attacked a shadow

547
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,889
file or so told to enter a new password

548
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,679
there so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they don't make it</font>

549
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy but what is left is these kids for</font>

550
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,970
an able to change the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> so other</font>

551
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,859
people explore the standardized and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

552
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:11,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">starts and imports and knowledge</font>

553
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:14,970
assistance<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of how they</font>

554
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,939
transferred binary to the device the

555
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,849
device did not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp or HTTP client</font>

556
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,909
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there was a tftp but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

557
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:25,979
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really working very well so this</font>

558
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">sun came up with this method of echoing</font>

559
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:31,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the binary they have a little python</font>

560
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,668
script that sort of automates that and

561
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,999
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were coughing and boots</font>

562
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,030
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you get in such to that device</font>

563
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:39,220
so the middle

564
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:42,190
convert with our view there there VidCon

565
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,760
liner so remind me little bit of Kermit

566
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:49,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> such but anyway so what they were</font>

567
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,890
really after there was this analogy

568
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">lasts one thing about the security</font>

569
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:01,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">cameras many smaller medium-sized</font>

570
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:06,250

it's open up that for the file and

573
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,310
because we don't really know which port

574
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:18,929
you need to open let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up all</font>

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:21,659
that like it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so now this DVR</font>

internet but sometimes that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:40,120
but not always number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is</font>

582
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,340
there one day<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticularly expert was this</font>

586
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,670
tool for them to use sort of marriage

587
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:58,240
marriage that device and it led to a

588
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:01,360
number of interesting compromises

589
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:06,790
now these compromises they steal your

besides the training people are like

00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:23,720
this since we have no more devices we

690
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,930
need more security professionals so the

City of Orlando has like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a</font>

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,060
hire a guide for each device it's not

698
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,630
going to work a very poor job that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

system would you for all of your data is

715
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,730
it so network segmentation is a great

716
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:53,150
earlier but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to do that</font>

717
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:57,109

with your mad hops he sees another

721
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:13,279
segment with your smart devices like TVs

722
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:15,319
and such on the third segment and watch

723
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:16,999
what bricks and what kind of function on

use your phone as a remote all these

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,629
this little gadget things that we like a

728
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:35,890
create connections yes helps but not

729
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,890
necessary so it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement</font>

730
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:43,720
onboarding devices think about these

731
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:47,170
streetlights what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need right now</font>

738
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,759
a procedure how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we</font>

739
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,100
train that guy you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct or maybe</font>

740
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,930
someone else is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it before they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going out next to installing that like</font>

742
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,460
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever works here but I</font>

743
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,160
didn't hear definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to be</font>

744
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,830
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were built first before you</font>

745
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,759
actually go in and install all those

746
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,029
three guys because once they're out

747
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,610
there fixing stuff later that's what no

748
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it means if you're any worse where but</font>

749
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:42,680
anyway how do you catch devices

750
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,200
if you have in those that give a<font color="#CCCCCC"> unix</font>

751
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:49,040
network you have systems that do

752
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,439
patching 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> Val if your business updates</font>

753
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,570
servers in sajan you can bark which pass

754
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,580
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> install and set all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

755
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,160
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are used to working with but for this</font>

756
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,980
devices but typically don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

757
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,859
systems yet and we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

758
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:08,930
sort of passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> and figure out if</font>

759
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:13,070
they're out of there so anyway how do

760
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:15,830
you deal with logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one good piece</font>

761
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,710
of news when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to devices they</font>

762
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:22,600
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't create blocks so they</font>

763
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:28,370
won't overload your logging system but

764
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:31,779
don't want blocks about failures or

765
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:34,580
failure of the device in the general so

766
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,930
what kind of locks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean how do you</font>

767
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,049
collect them efficiently without

768
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:41,629
overloading<font color="#E5E5E5"> our our existing</font>

769
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:44,300
infrastructure because again if you ask

770
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:48,610
nikki right now or whatever try to buy

771
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,610
one that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times as big</font>

772
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:59,540
so in it how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it don't like</font>

773
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:02,600
crap there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one spot</font>

774
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:06,440
in that process but you have that much

775
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:11,630
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> before purchase order</font>

776
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:15,350
assigned so if you're involved in a

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,810
project important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their security</font>

778
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:23,060
guys always don't be the guy that says

779
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:25,940
no because then they won't ask you but

780
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,770
before purchase that's when you may be

781
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,490
able to get some cooperation here from

782
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:34,009
the vendor to build things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like patching</font>

783
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:36,140
and to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the scripts and</font>

784
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:40,010
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually manage all</font>

785
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:43,250
that doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you credit if you miss that</font>

786
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:46,070
spot thanks pretty much over and then

787
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do in security should be to</font>

788
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:52,810
scale and such so these standards build

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> army</font>

790
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:03,670

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,670
in control

792
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:11,130
somewhat luckily sure who is control

793
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:18,600
very fast I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the machines are</font>

794
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:20,670
in control here maybe it's cool it's the

795
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,750
hacker who just pwned all of your

796
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:29,760
devices that's in control but the user

797
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:34,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually not really in people I did</font>

without the mobilized all of my back

you located Roger extension group does

00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,970
that like what this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> light bulb</font>

to the user to configure which is fine

for a home system when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have 10 light</font>

824
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:19,779
need it is something like that behind

825
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,430
Wi-Fi now where we do have some key

826
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,590
distribution mechanisms the problem is

takes power takes mine

828
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,550
it's

we

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,829
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is white why did good</font>

just negotiating retro standard they

834

so you see your top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 IP addresses if</font>

855
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on one of those IP addresses</font>

857
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,210
attacked by the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

858
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">laughter it was also a daily report</font>

859
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:47,410
which one's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spreading but yes</font>

860
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,490
so yes the question here yes you do get

861
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,490
feedback on what you're spinning

862
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:02,300
like question is how much data can I

863
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:05,110
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> the do currently get i think</font>

864
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,610
around last time i checked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

865
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:11,000
120,000 IP address of airport us every

866
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:14,150
day it's a few gigabytes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud all</font>

867
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">works but we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever before as more</font>

868
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,330
sort of deadlock submitters actually

869
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,520
right now if you have a vector force the

870
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:22,460
web server like one project you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is</font>

871
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,840
called a fluorophore project it's a

872
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,460
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dormant right now because we</font>

873
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,120
need more submitters where you basically

874
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,650
sent to us all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the logs of 404 errors</font>

875
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,380
where people try to get their page if

876
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:35,270
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> post the reason we need more</font>

877
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:38,810
submitters for that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also privacy I</font>

878
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:42,170
don't want to show users<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

website that your<font color="#CCCCCC"> honor was not found</font>

880
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:47,960
unless a good number of submitters work

881
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,550

884
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,559
a question here was what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools</font>
