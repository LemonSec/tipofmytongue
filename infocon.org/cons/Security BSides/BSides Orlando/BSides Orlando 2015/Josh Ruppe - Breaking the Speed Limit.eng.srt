several yes that the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses</font>

other variable speed limit systems

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,289
they've been used in different

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,630
capacities since the 50s actually it's

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,579
only nowadays to where you can get a

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,170
want a free vulnerability scan some said

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,320
yes

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,479
no go away got my experience there then

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,020
moved on gotta learn what I needed to

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,530
know blows his contact information was

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,840
it about me this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available this</font>

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,960
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available online later on so</font>

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,280
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the history</font>

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,380
why these systems exist in the first

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,720
place how they function how they

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:16,459
communicate and potential security risk

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,170
vision so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much how they</font>

49
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion the first generation</font>

50
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,708
of these things granted like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said vs</font>

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,059

<font color="#E5E5E5">the science and flip them up making 55</font>

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,880
flip them up making 65 you know these

57
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,000
got introduced thinking that sometimes

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,489
in your abs is a their scent if these

middle of Madison Square Garden they're

71
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,810
very well known for what they do the bad

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,090
part is is that when they ship these

73
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,040
things they hard code in the default

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,630

another party in the princess

79
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:31,730
later on um it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,640
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it Lock use the controller you</font>

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,500
change it and put your messaged up there

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,350
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen funny ones and I've seen</font>

84
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,290
endorsing this don't do it then you had

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,090
later on different ones so you had what

86
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,370
I also considered the second generation

87
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,390
so officially the second generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

88
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,640
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consider to be the second</font>

89
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,100
generation these were called variable

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,260
message signs also known as changeable

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,870
electronic dynamic and in UK they're

92
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,310
known as matrix science um these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

93
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,800
little bit these are lot tougher

94
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,200
actually to get into a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

95
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe they have attention of a fiber</font>

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">optic they could have sure the internet</font>

97
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,160
will let me know but they most of time

98
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,049
is always the EPL that went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to a box</font>

99
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,320
translated a signal but have signed up

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,420
on the window screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell but you could</font>

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,950
also go to it and there's a padlock box

102
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,300
on the side that has a serial connector

103
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,010
and the inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it if you know linux</font>

104
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,490
you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you can change the</font>

105
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,570
message to display line people also got

106
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,450
a hold of that as well the one the top

one the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> vector done somewhere i</font>

110
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,300
don't do this they will find you because

111
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the time especially for the main</font>

114
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,760
this very reason so why this is why y

115
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,950
sin and locked up from Atlanta the line

121
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">expenses so why those are all this</font>

122
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,020
trouble well first track control

123
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,569
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why they do these</font>

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,628
things can going off sensors that I'll

125
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,610
go over will adjust speeds even though

126
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,189
yes rush hour it's Friday and it's

127

of control secondly it reduces accident

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:51,279
and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

138
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,789
accidents you know you get to these

00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,309
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations to where people want</font>

143
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,508
week I was in one of these areas it's

144
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">not perfect I suppose at that point but</font>

145
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:09,550
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another reason why they do it</font>

146
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,599
and third statistics basically they want

147
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,979
to have statistics they want to know how

148
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people are traveling these roads a</font>

149
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:15,938
day how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are getting in</font>

150
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,499
accidents a day but by using these they

151
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,180
can say well the speed limit was lower

152
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,499
then you know we have this many

153
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,189
accidents<font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels higher we have</font>

154
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:25,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">evening excellence so obviously nowadays</font>

155
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,070
always statistics

156
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,740
any other kind of information gathering

157
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,020
activity that you can do Saturday's

158
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,330
function well they you thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

159
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,479
use a combination of sensors in order to

160
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,280
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the display speed this update</font>

161
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,020
some of us automatic some can be manual

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,530
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends it really comes down to the</font>

163
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,750
person that's controlling the VSS which

164
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,640
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in department transportation</font>

165
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">hace atopy yes I'll nobody was ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

166
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,620
notice these things up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road I</font>

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,710
have him a whole lot I never know what

168
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,730
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did looked into him until I got the</font>

169
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down this really figure out these</font>

170
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,470
things what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it counts cars</font>

171
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,909
going by her can count cars going by but

172
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,230
the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the writing</font>

173
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">count the height of the car that way</font>

174
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,800
they can save as many cars goes by this

175
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,810
many trucks go by these means semis go

176
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
by so they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so at that point</font>

177
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,370
they can say well in the last five

178
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,100
minutes you know 2,000 cars went by hair

179
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,210
so the normal 500 they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font>

180
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through a</font>

181
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,789
series of algorithms that's going to say

182
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,590
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lower to speed because</font>

183
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,460
of traffic incidents going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Harrison</font>

184
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,539
also works out<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether since this is</font>

185
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,250
graphic up i'm sure they don't look like

186
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,250
this but you know you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

187
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,530
goes off wind speed humidity any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

188
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,990
moisture level is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and just all</font>

189
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:46,669
feeds into the system and it works into

190
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,870
telling the main main control that

191
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,520
whether or not you know look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> where i</font>

192
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,500
was getting too wet then you need a

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,620
justice because getting too cold do we

194
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,230
need justice be cetera et cetera and

195
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,640
also road conditions senses so these

196
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things the little black one in the</font>

197
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,159
middle is a club that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be installed</font>

198
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the actual ground and the page</font>

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the road and it can tell whether or</font>

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,860
not some sort of maybe even a flammable

of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they can go back send alerts</font>

204
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,780

<font color="#CCCCCC">you today primarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,380
distance that are involved in these

209
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">things at least in Atlanta and 285</font>

210
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,700
there's like such as eighty eight of

211
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,799
them each one I believe is to two and

212

<font color="#CCCCCC">half miles of cart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're always a mile</font>

down from the layers on rent so fiber

214
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,810
optic is obviously be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best I did to</font>

215
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,220
communicate to these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless of</font>

216
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,079
course you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going passes</font>

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,740
general distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a generator</font>

219
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,600
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that point you know you know</font>

220
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,610
all right long as far off has been

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,710
around they'd be better uses for it

222
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,430
other than you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they typically</font>

223
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,110
do such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> decent these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

be people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get behind they give an</font>

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,550
advantage they slam on it back your next

227
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
they make noise not that it's not good

228
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,550
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's over all the primary</font>

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,830
primary function of fiber optics

230
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,719
secondly there's wireless communication

231
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,490
so a lot of these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have pictures</font>

232
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,430
the ones that are deployed in Atlanta<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

233
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,410
anyone's being here up on i4i for has

234
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,459
some of these things installed there a

235
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,689
little bit different than ones they have

236
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Atlanta but they still work the same</font>

237
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,230
way still get a signal i believe is

238
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,000
through fiber optic<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll look into the</font>

239
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,120
one in Florida<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida's website and</font>

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,560
department transportation allows you to

our George George<font color="#CCCCCC"> department reputation</font>

242
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,550
as a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at the project</font>

243
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

246
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">nodes you can really go through</font>

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> florida does not so</font>

248
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,899
wireless communications another one is

249
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,080
sell your long-distance Wi-Fi standard

250
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,910
radio it really depends i<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed here</font>

251
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,550
lately the SDR community has really been

252
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,439
blowing up getting a lot bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sure</font>

253
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,029
somebody probably take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

254
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,470
see you know exactly how they're

255
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,880
communicating<font color="#E5E5E5"> per se i'm sure it's</font>

256
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,190
always different hardly want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

257
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,670
implement is themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then there's</font>

258
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,079
standalone standalone like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dms is</font>

259
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,750
that like i said consider

260
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">second-generation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone has to go out</font>

261
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to plug a serial cable into it and say</font>

262
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,890
they can program time a program times

263
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they want you know as</font>

264
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,199
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as how they're going to set to speed</font>

265
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,760
but maybe not you know when we breaking

266
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,660
up remotely connect to it sets itself

267
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,399
that's worth it sup main point of this

268
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,019
is where we spend most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our time I</font>

269
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,200
don't know if a little bit too<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast and</font>

270
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,820
night but this like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,130
outside main point where the security

272
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk so I got that I've spent a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

273
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,300
time I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on this about six</font>

274
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,040
months because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta implemented their</font>

275
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,439
system in September they finalized in

276
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,670
September and got it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and as</font>

277
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,829
soon as I got into it I started

278
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,689
wondering you know what if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

279
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,670
in there everybody in the trim know is

280
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,959
going to disagree if somebody got into

281
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,329
the assistance and settle this speed

282
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,040
limit signs at 99 miles per hour people

283
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,430
are going to go 99 99 miles per hour

284
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,610
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> would even second guess so what</font>

285
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,699

no encryption on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

287
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,959
contacted a lot of the manufacturers of

288
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,000
these these Sciences specializing

289
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,199
anybody can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you gotta have</font>

290
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,149
this controller that can receive the

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,529
companies out there manufacturers out

294
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,570
there that actually specialize in these

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that make them is their day to</font>

298
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,400
commute I talked to all of them but I

299
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,739
thought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah I thought a 10-plus</font>

300
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,030
none of them using encryption they don't

301
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,010
have the hardware that supports

302
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,630
decryption on their side they don't have

303
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,460
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take in anything other</font>

304
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,680
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plain text if they get so</font>

305
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,990
obviously i think i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

306
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue with it so with or being no</font>

307
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,730
encryption that obviously opens up the

308
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,610
attack for a man in the middle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

309
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,670
middle being is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most easiest and</font>

310
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,170
undetectable way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that at</font>

311
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,540
least in the case of this there's no

312
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,780
encryption you have had<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would imagine</font>

313
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,160
an ideas to point down the line to

314
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,500
actually see if somebody's getting in

315
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,469
between you and the science actually see

316
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,090
what's going on we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

317
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if it is fiber optic you know</font>

318
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,060
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say well it's a little hard</font>

319
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,390
against with our rocket network it's

320
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not there's a fiber optic once a</font>

321
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,920
hack there's a fiber optic way go

322
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,020
bending you all you do is you bend the

323
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,630
actual fibre-optic you don't have to cut

324
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,340
into it you don't cut it to the line you

325
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">bend it literally literally physically</font>

326
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,360
bend it and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover on it so</font>

327
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,680
that's a little little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny pin it lets</font>

328
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,330
a little bit of light radiates through

329
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,189
the sheath that goes into a photo

330
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,420
detector and sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

331
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,150
here for this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this did a little</font>

332
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,979
bit I've never done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously but</font>

333
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it has a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> photo detector hook to</font>

334
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,220
it that connects to a little converter

335
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,750
that then transfer

336
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,400
dad to electrical signals and you have

337
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,110
that convert<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a network interface and</font>

338
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,939
then you can figure out exactly what's

339
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,490
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

340
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice it's the way this transmits</font>

341
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,170
through that to fiber optic cable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

342
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">does make it hard so that being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

343
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,920
with via cells you know what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

344
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:26,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the movie the progress that the</font>

345
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,990
process in order to do this so basically

346
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start out in the command center</font>

347
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,960
wherever that would be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your city</font>

348
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,390
department transportation would control

349
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,140
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would start at probably a server</font>

350
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,670
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's XP hope not Windows 7 PC which</font>

351
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,830
we then go to a switch or router the

352
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,199
firewall and it ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

hit those speed limits and even though

476
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,750
yeah you could post up a sign or so that

477
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,730
says you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 miles per hour thing is</font>

478
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,830
is when it comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff if you</font>

were to go to that you couldn't say oh

480
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,070
well the sign told me it was told me it

481
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,330
was 99 miles per hour because you're

hopefully hopefully hopefully won't be

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,540
that easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pull up saw the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highway</font>

and actually install one or put it up a

489
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,100

right down the road so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

497
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,290
problem when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard right look the</font>

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,150
traffic in front of them doesn't know

499
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,460
better so save one cars driving by I'm

500
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,470
just plucking all these behind them to

501
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,090
be faster I don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all the road</font>

all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards that they were going with</font>

503
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:12,500
or not yeah i mean it is comes down to

504
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,820
it comes down to like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

505
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical safety of everyone traveling</font>

506
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,310
and now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first thing i</font>

507
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,570
thought it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said when I saw this</font>

508
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,740
and I saw him deployed the first thing I

509
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,659
thought it was somebody got in there and

510
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,890
actually changed the speeds there be

511
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,180
people that would obey and people who

512
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,830
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it even still</font>

513
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,930
all states still have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah</font>

514
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,970
maximum speed limit that you cannot none

515
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,890
or no circumstance ever exceed not

516
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,240
everyone knows that some people do some

517
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,620
people don't if you don't know it you

518
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,690
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun you're going to think you're</font>

519
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,860
legally able to go that speed so you're

520
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,300
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those on the interstate that</font>

521
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,010
are going 55 and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

522
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,680
interstate there are going 99 and

523
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:51,629
there's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> weave back and forth right</font>

524
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,490
so I mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I</font>

525
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,560
consider the risk is just this was you

526
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:00,510
know physical harm I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

527
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,710
put physical sign up either<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I mean</font>

528
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:06,650
yeah I mean there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of ways of</font>

529
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:09,150
doing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with the what is the</font>

530
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,560
growing internet of things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

531
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,270
guess how does one with that especially

532
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,620
like I said with the other other systems

533
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,560
within the department transportation

534
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,530
being older being on XP you know if

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,710
yeah you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody was just to try</font>

right yeah that's that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the</font>

547
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,309
issue

548

requires very little human input but if

563
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,450
they wanted to they wanted to manually

564
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,460
change it there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop down that they</font>

565
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that drop-down has three speeds ins</font>

566
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,700
45 45 55 and 65 they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it</font>

567
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,240
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but again no encryption</font>

568
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">man in the middle except reception so</font>

569
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:33,950
going on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned this is the</font>

570
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,360
nte or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NPC IP this is the national</font>

transportation communication for

572
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,129
intelligent transportation systems

573
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,540
protocol as long there's no encryption

574
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,620
requirement in this thing whatsoever

575
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,879
this goes back into and again after the

576
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,879
internet will can correct me if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

577
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,160
wrong this also ties into cameras that

578
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,900
are controlled by to say red lights that

579
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,970
are controlled by the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything is</font>

580
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,790
controlled by the state goes through or

581
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:02,570
any intelligent transportation system

582
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:05,750
like those all have to obey this is

583
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,220
outlined this guy that are several parts

584
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,040
to it there's several several parts to

585
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,230
it mainly this is the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy this goes</font>

586
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,909
through and basically says these are

587
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,059
things you can a can't do but each one

588
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">has its own elaborative separate</font>

589
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,620
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through them all all Stanford</font>

590
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:23,149
I'll search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an encryption read most</font>

591
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,309
of them search or encryptions search

592
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:27,139
rhetoric ripped nothing shows up so

593
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,658
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing outlined by and this is</font>

594
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,860
issued by the government this says the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

595
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,840
had to have encryption on these things

596
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:41,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think Nina's more so that's more</font>

597
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:43,490
the bigger issue but uh and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

598
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,340
last life so that's that really quit

599
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:52,909
thinkin everyone's life easier so any

600
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:54,889
more questions or anything yes sir and

601
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:58,399
actually last time<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really powerful</font>

602
00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:00,229
because password reuse I think the

603
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest issues so it's not just that</font>

604
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,190
these things are imprinted how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

605
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,570
those passwords that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

606
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">ballistics really other questions are</font>

607
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,009
they authenticated at all so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call</font>

608
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,009
the company that makes them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlanta i</font>

609
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:15,919
called them they weren't responsive to

610
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:17,360
the Afghan them questions I don't want

611
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,159
to go the route of trying to show so

612
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,629
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the social</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering answers out</font>

613
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,129
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I call it other companies and</font>

614
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:23,719
other companies they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were more</font>

615
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:25,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to talking and mainly because they</font>

616
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,669
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have systems in Atlanta I'm sure</font>

617
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:31,399
but some of them some of them do but

618
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,409
only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> between what they have is</font>

619
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,850
basically they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a box between where</font>

620
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:36,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have maybe the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> department</font>

621
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,199
transportations main command center and

622
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:41,330
it goes to another box and then that

623
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,330
goes out to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they all work</font>

624
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,369
one off and are just one goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to next</font>

625
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,070
one falls in<font color="#CCCCCC"> policing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever they said</font>

626
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,658
they had a system at whole thing fails

627
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,039
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that in Atlanta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

628
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,590
doesn't work away as a wireless backup

629
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,539
in Atlanta but<font color="#E5E5E5"> some with indicate the</font>

630
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,990
rest of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> no you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you send it</font>

631
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:02,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">information displays it on the screen no</font>

632
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,110
it's all 11 mile

633
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,340
I can't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all of them but for the</font>

634
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,740
ones that I got in contact with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

635
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,510
it's all one way because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like I</font>

636
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,950
said most of them have a cameras that

637
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,140
are pointed of them that's their

638
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,400
bi-directional authentication or not an

639
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
indication of a bidirectional way of

640
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,390
figuring out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the size</font>

641
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:23,669
displaying what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to the</font>

642
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,289
wrist really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I seek you with that if you</font>

643
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,330
mentioned the cameras there's really

644
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:29,850
privacy concerns and you've created a

645
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,539
surveillance network that if if you

646
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:38,490
chose to you can utilize that for your

647
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:41,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">own purposes and a 2nd is 1st and 2nd</font>

648
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,700
gen has been the higher grit you can

649
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,159
create panic by saying that there's a

650
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">shooting or something like that that</font>

651
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,390
diverts people off the roads that's our

652
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,209
that's a real social safety is your true

653
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,340
and if you use an Amber Alert to take

654
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:02,780
someone they particularly happy but they

655
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:05,520
say their license plate so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

656
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,090
true yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for that's very good</font>

657
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,918
point yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it I just hope it's</font>

658
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,389
something like this puts pressure on the

659
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,490
government to block these things down

660
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,200
because I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to happen my</font>

661
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,460
wife's in here with me I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

662
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,990
her I wouldn't want nothing to happen to

663
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,730
her I would want to have her family my

664
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,169
family anyone sent we should we

665
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,179
shouldn't like that happening you know I

666
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,860
like he mentioned from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Darfur throw us</font>

667
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,120
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail-safe thing yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I granted they</font>

668
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,629
took over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire government's</font>

669
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,580
infrastructure unlikely<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I mean the</font>

670
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential is there when you don't employ</font>

671
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,699
encryption when you don't employ like

672
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,620
you said maybe authentication in between

673
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,260
the two and that's that's what worries

674
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,360
me and if I'm putting my life or not my

675
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,919
life i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess in slow dramatic say but if</font>

676
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,350
I'm putting myself on these interstates

677
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,980
I don't want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen cuz I'm</font>

678
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,870
gonna bei what I can please

679
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,429
order but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going 99 miles per</font>

680
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,989
hour and interstate I would hope anyone

681
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:56,480
would but there would be those that

682
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,010
would and that that's me that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk</font>

683
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
that that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would worry about</font>

684
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">because then you go back to that guy</font>

685
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:11,600
flying off the right yes sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it's not</font>

686
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:13,370
touching these signs at all no no so

687
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,809
like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I called I called</font>

688
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,178
several<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department ratifications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

689
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,220
called several manufacturers talk to him

690
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,679
some of them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment I said you know</font>

691
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing some security research no</font>

692
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,770
no we're not talking you have nothing to

693
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,330
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we don't want that</font>

694
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,480
information public we don't want anyone

695
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,070
to know about this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yeah</font>

696
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,260
that's that thing worries me because

697
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,600
I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it it may exist I'm sure</font>

698
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,950
like I said internet will tell me but I

699
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exists they have</font>

700
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,120
security audits that are done<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the on</font>

701
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,710
the state that's not done by the state

702
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,389
this stays not gonna throw itself

703
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,400
underneath the bus you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

704
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,049
