technical training at sands it's really

82
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,390
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> high impact good quality material</font>

83
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,700
and is well worth the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money maybe even</font>

84
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,400
double the money so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,340
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth it but what I do mean to</font>

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,919
say is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also need to be</font>

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,650
developing ourselves and our careers and

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,450
so it's it's necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> complement the</font>

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,210
technical skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> with also a little bit</font>

90
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the career oriented stuff and so</font>

91
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what this talk is about and I'm</font>

92
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,119
glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're here for it so the</font>

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,950
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is are you developing your</font>

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,090
career at least at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> balanced level with</font>

95
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,210
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to learn your</font>

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical skills I know several people</font>

97
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are really great technically but</font>

98
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,440
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no visibility at</font>

99
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,969
work and as a result they get overlooked

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,100
for promotions they don't get the lion's

101
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,830
share of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the raises even though they may</font>

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,490
be huge a huge contributor on several

103
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,099
different fronts and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think some of</font>

104
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,980
that comes to not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing</font>

105
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,810
one's career their awareness about

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,910
themselves and how they portray

107
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,620
themselves at their work stuff like that

108
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,320
developing relationships we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,930
go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> five tips in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,790
now I'm going to leave you<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and I</font>

111
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,910
also hope that you do ask some questions

112
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,670
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can help you more specifically</font>

113
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,260
so with developing your career you know

114
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,950
technologies are constantly advancing

115
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,950
and

116
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:18,860
you know if you knew visual basic you

117
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,110
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you learn vb net java python</font>

118
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,760
learn all these programming languages

119
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:28,070
you learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis you learn rapid7 it's a</font>

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,050
never-ending series and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going</font>

121
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,830
to end there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a new technology</font>

122
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,540
to learn and so it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary to</font>

123
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,330
spend a little bit of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some of</font>

124
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,280
those eternal concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is you know</font>

125
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,650
some of the base career development

126
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,359
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what I'm trying to</font>

127
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,010
encourage with the slide and just

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,750
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that you know it's a very</font>

129
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,750
big part of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth and ability to</font>

130
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,850
command the salary that you deserve to

131
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,850
understand how to run your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> career</font>

132
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,920
so I've got some questions for you one

133
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,430

144
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,880
you have the great potential to be

145
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:41,710
satisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's good in the</font>

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,409
fact is and he said I have only myself

147
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,750
to blame the fact is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work</font>

148
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,320
for yourself which you know you're

149
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">really working for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers to or</font>

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,840
you are in a w-2 situation with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boss</font>

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,460
at work you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have yourself to</font>

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,679
blame and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

153
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,539
is about taking charge of your own

154
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,180
career so other questions that are

155
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,680
provocative are are you getting

156
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,340
compensated based on the value that

157
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,220
you're delivering is what do you do

158
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,690
making the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better place</font>

159
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,970
sometimes that's a personal goal that

160
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,040
someone has are you working on your

161
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,110
life's work<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you aspire for a more</font>

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,110
meaningful role in life and at work

163
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,789
only you can make yourself successful

164
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know if you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about your day</font>

165
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,860
to day when you wake up when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that alarm</font>

166
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,689
rings you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are you jazzed about</font>

167
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,050
getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bed and going into work</font>

168
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,150
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you waking up before the alarm rings</font>

169
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:48,839
just to go in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on some project</font>

170
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,630
are you really jazzed about it life is

171
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,740
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to make the most of it</font>

172
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,420
you've got to be doing what you love

173
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,340
doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people you love doing it</font>

174
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,770
with and it's a symbiotic relationship

175
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,600
so you know there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> give and</font>

176
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,730
take where you know you need to be

177
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,550
appreciated<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the work you need to feel</font>

178
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,070
appreciated so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be conscious</font>

179
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,770
of that your feelings there and also

180
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the objective stuff like total</font>

181
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,790
compensation packages that you're

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,090
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your work but the most</font>

183
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,099
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think is you</font>

184
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,350
enjoy what you're doing you feel that

185
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> living your purpose you're living</font>

186
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,560
your dream and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just really loving</font>

187
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,110
your job so we're never all going to

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,530
love it a hundred percent but if you can

189
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,210
reduce the amount of percentage that of

190
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,910
your job that you don't really like so

191
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,880
much and increase the percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

192
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,959
pie that you really love doing at work

193
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,130
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what you should be so</font>

194
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,400
you're the main ingredient for your

195
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,810
success and sometimes that starts with

196
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,890
having a good attitude and a good

197
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:58,829
outlook on what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

198
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,360
point I've got two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

199
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,230
share with you two types of mentality

200
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is the victim hood mentality we all</font>

201
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,280
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all fall into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this from time</font>

202
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,280
to time and

203
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,760
the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a take-charge mentality</font>

204
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:20,850
where you're conscious about what you're

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,260
experiencing your feelings and you know

206
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,380
you know when to take a break when

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,330
you're falling into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad attitude so</font>

208
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,980
just to break down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two mentalities</font>

209
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,840
first of all does it you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

210
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,490
any questions so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because if no</font>

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,020
one has any questions I'm popping one of

212
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,710
these open and downing it right now I

213
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,590
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even drink this stuff so okay all</font>

214
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,250
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to see me down and</font>

215
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to</font>

216
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,040
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're right so gentlemen's comment</font>

217
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,690
is this presentation is not just about

218
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec that it could apply just in</font>

219
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:08,420
general to a leadership angle and that's

220
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,959
true and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are all whether</font>

221
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,449
we're owning our own business<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whether</font>

222
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,638
we're owning our own career we are

223
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,859
leaders of it and there's ways to be

224
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,220
leaders at work whether we're a manager

225
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:31,100
or not so very insightful lemon or

226
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:35,029
orange all right one more where that

227
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,149
came from so victimhood mentality this

228
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,399
is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous we all fall into</font>

229
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it because we're all human but you know</font>

230
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,300
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so victimhood</font>

231
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,069
mentality is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and</font>

232
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,099
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some vision for you and</font>

233
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:53,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">using up your career for their own ends</font>

234
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,889
and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are struggling to go</font>

235
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:57,050
this other direction but they're wasting

236
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,329
your time on this other stuff and you

237
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,300
know so there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling I don't</font>

238
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:04,579
know if anyone resonates with this but I

239
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,589
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that way at various points of</font>

240
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:10,250
my career and I'm just putting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

241
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:14,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">own language but you know they tell you</font>

242
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:17,029
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and you know you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

243
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,800
feeling that the end of the day you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

244
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:22,459
a paycheck to survive or support your

245
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,209
family and maybe you start just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

246
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:30,469
through the motions so that leads to

247
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:33,469
stagnation in your current job and you

248
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,329
could have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know motivated by fear</font>

249
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,279
that's not a good thing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at</font>

250
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,930
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're motivated by fear you're</font>

251
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not exactly going to produce your best</font>

252
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,079
work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of scenario so I would</font>

253
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,689
also say victimhood is when you're

254
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,479
overly reliant upon an employer<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

255
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:52,469
promotion you know or you're waiting for

256
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that bonus in March</font>

257
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,980
you know and you know maybe there's

258
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,290
something else some other carrot that an

259
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,020
employer dangles in front of you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

260
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,849
retention standpoint and what I just

261
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to say is if you ever struggle</font>

262
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,410
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of paths in</font>

263
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,820
front of you one is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the carrot</font>

264
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,969
in front of the donkey whether it's

265
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,660
money or anything else prestige

266
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,310
positioning a position of authority try

267
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,620
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be swayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by corporate</font>

268
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,300
accouterments because<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

269
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,560
raised to that new level whether its

270
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,270
financial or you know title if you're

271
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,489
like me you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to that</font>

272
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,520
new level it starts to be normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

273
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,680
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to want the next</font>

274
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,470
level a next level but really all of

275
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leveling is is it's a it's a</font>

276
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:46,140
distraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> because at the end of the</font>

277
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,000
day you know what you want to do the

278
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,880
contributions you want to make in our

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,290
field and the more time you spend kind

280
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
of chasing the carrots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

281
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,900
distracted with corporate accouterments

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,300
it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away the time</font>

283
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,689
that you have to devote into performing

284
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:08,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">your life's work in infosec so so that's</font>

285
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:10,470
a victim hood mentality yeah

286
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,760
it's awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's interesting</font>

287
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,649
seconding your current job car left with

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">fear of leaving I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people get</font>

289
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,600
into that metallic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the job</font>

290
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:26,110
leads down because their second they're

291
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:28,420
no longer yeah that's that's a wise

292
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,170
observation so are you so the job leaves

293
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:36,250
them as their stagnating in their job

294
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,550
maybe they get terminated yeah that

295
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,550
could happen

296
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,300
yeah the job has evolved beyond your

297
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,130
skills and you've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been more in an</font>

operational role just keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

299
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,390
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> running as it is instead of</font>

300
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:59,180
developing the business in developing a

301
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:04,699
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of innovative ways to do the same</font>

thank you for that though on the

306

take-charge mentality<font color="#E5E5E5"> side it's it's a</font>

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,459
it's different it's not the exact

308
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:27,140
opposite but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's different different</font>

309
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:28,790
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth noting so you have a</font>

310
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,579
vision to fulfill with your own career

311
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,680
instead of some job title controlling

312
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,930
what your career is about and you know

313
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,109
letting that be so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

314
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,079
true to that and you're maximizing your

impact in the world in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your career and</font>

316
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,130
you're taking deliberate efforts to

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,430
align your career your your work with

318
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">your career goals and sometimes you have</font>

319
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,380
to recognize when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time to move on</font>

320
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,600
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't necessarily a bad thing</font>

321
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,360
it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very positive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for</font>

322
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,339
your employer and for you and it could

323
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">be mutually beneficial to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize when</font>

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on now when I say it's</font>

325
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:08,329
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on that might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be it's time</font>

326
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to another role within your</font>

327
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,620
company or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> department in the</font>

328
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,000
company you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe you found</font>

329
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,070
something you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really passionate about</font>

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,540
cleaning up or some business process

331
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,640
improvement that might take a year or

332
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,610
more to improve and you just might want

333
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,010
to propose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your boss that your</font>

334
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,180
position changes a little bit so it

335
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,760
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily mean that you're</font>

336
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving the company but I think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

337
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,589
important to know when you know your

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">your job is getting out of alignment</font>

339
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,209
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your career goals and i would say</font>

340
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,268
i'd recommend talking to your boss about

341
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,430
that because unless there are a complete

342
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:45,910
jerk

343
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,339
you know manager 101 is is trying to

344
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,500
really get the most out of each

345
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,500
individual based on what their talent is

346
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,460
and what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for the company so</font>

347
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:04,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were probably welcome that</font>

348
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:06,370
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah I've seen it many</font>

349
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,290
times so the comment is you might be

350
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,599
creating your own job within the

351
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,760

352
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,339
even exist I've seen this happen time

353
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,129
and time again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know if you're</font>

354
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,040

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,940
happen the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're even</font>

363

380
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,810
visualization of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think success</font>

381
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,840
needs to be in infosec when you start

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,940
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this oh gosh I didn't</font>

attitude having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great attitude</font>

386
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,670
sometimes having a great attitude can

387
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,490
help you overcome a lot of obstacles and

388
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,440
help the team get unstuck unjammed from

389
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,530
certain situations especially if things

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,270
don't go your way some political battles

391
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,750
going on stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that having a good</font>

392
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,760
attitude is really really crucial below

393
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,820
that in the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diagram is</font>

394
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,610

399
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,000
take on how does that fit into the

400
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:23,490
puzzle what piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the puzzle is that</font>

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you so purpose is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

402
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to visualize your success</font>

403
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,800
discipline discipline is something that

404
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,990
a lot of us lack and but there's so many

405
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,680
tools that can help us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

406
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:40,380
this is having a good morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> routine</font>

407
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,480
having a calendar-like with different

408
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,570
tasks periodic tasks that you need to do

409
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,030
on a daily weekly monthly basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

410
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,000
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like following up</font>

411
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,360
with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your former bosses just to</font>

412
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,800
say hey man I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you and</font>

413
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,560
how's everything going here's what I'm

414
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,840
working on you know how is it with you

415
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,899
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's someone that a former</font>

416
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,310
colleague that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shared a cube with or</font>

417
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,200
something maybe you follow up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him</font>

418
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,480
say hey I was just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

419
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,630
old days when you know we had to share a

420
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,220
cube and

421
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,190
now I had to buy you that underarm

422
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,290
deodorant you know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know staying</font>

423
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,510
in touch with people you can systemize

424
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,879
that through discipline through

425
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,370
calendars and such so I think that's

426
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,390
necessary quarterly looking through the

427
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,520
goals that you have set<font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself</font>

428
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,970
find out where you are relative to them

429
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the last one and its last</font>

430
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:37,210
for a reason is your skills you know

431
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,800
skills I think everyone knows that we

432
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,380
have to have skills we have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mad</font>

433
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,040
skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to be competent in the</font>

434
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,960
infosec field so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty</font>

435
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,790
sure you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that already but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

436
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,790
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to say that skills is not</font>

437
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:55,290
just the technical skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know can</font>

438
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:58,389
you write a Python script it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

439
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,139
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how to talk to someone in</font>

440
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,930
the business about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they shouldn't be</font>

441
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,020
using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 character password maybe they</font>

442
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,780
should move to a passphrase you know can

443
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you explain that in layman's term terms</font>

444
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,310
to them and then go talk to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

445
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,380
admin about why shared credentials

446
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:22,060
should not be used you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

447
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,150
able to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those conversations yeah go</font>

448
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,149
ahead

449
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,649
yes that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good one how to make your</font>

450
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,630
field relative to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their field I think</font>

451
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good call I mean we've all</font>

452
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,520
got different roles in in the company

453
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we're all striving for the same</font>

454
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,280
thing sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have there's</font>

455
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,730
some obstacles that need to be overcome

456
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,168
and you know conversations need to be

457
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,890
had you have to be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at having</font>

458
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:57,169
conversations that involve conflict but

459
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,169
not cower down from conflict yes

460
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,510
why the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why is skills under</font>

461
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:12,899
both purpose and it's also under skills

462
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,190
no real reason probably probably is it

463
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:22,590
real great from a presentation

464
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:24,390
standpoint yeah so you know initially

465
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:28,800
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put this together it was kind of</font>

466
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,450
based on a word doc that I wrote but you

467
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,899
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide you know it says</font>

468
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">purpose having a definitive purpose</font>

469
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:39,660
something that you know focuses on your

470
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,730
strengths and then also with an

471
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding of your weaknesses you</font>

472
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,310
know and trying to really focus on those

473
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,350
strengths areas that make you unique

474
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:56,220
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> includes skills right so I've</font>

475
00:22:49,350 --> 00:23:01,959
gotten a association in a lot deeper it

476
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:05,350
could be either yep all right

477
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,880
so my view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this triangle is that when</font>

478
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,908
you're looking at creating a plan for

479
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,909
yourself to be successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of</font>

480
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:17,860
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> components need to be at play not</font>

481
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one so as an example have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

482
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,639
known someone that has really great

483
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:27,840
skills that has a bad attitude has

484
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,809
anyone ever known someone like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

485
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,730
now sometimes they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get away with it</font>

486
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,158
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the environment but it's</font>

487
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,760
usually not long so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have any</font>

488
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,760
stories to share

489
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I won't force it so how about</font>

490
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,840
someone with a lot of discipline so

491
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,480
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good plugging and</font>

492
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,600
chugging discipline oriented but at the

493
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,520
same time they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no</font>

494
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,570
purpose whatsoever maybe don't even know

495
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,550
what the company purpose is right so I

496
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,309
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes this could be compliance</font>

497
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:11,610
analyst or you know someone that's just

498
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:14,730
really good at ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros i's and</font>

499
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:18,059
t's but they really don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> friggin</font>

500
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,250
clue so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've all seen that that</font>

501
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,770
type of person as well sometimes this is

502
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,980
a junior level person just getting in

503
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field and they might waste a few</font>

504
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,040
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they start to realize the</font>

505
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,040
bigger picture

506
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,960
okay so on creating a plan this is all

507
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">about defining your mission and your</font>

508
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,720
goals and you can combine life with

509
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,180
career I would encourage it it does i

510
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,550
mean it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> to most of us our</font>

511
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:54,280
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and career is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a blend anyway</font>

512
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,040
but define those missions and goals for

513
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,070
yourself identify what gaps exist when

514
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you assess yourself and where you are do</font>

515
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,020
you have what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve that</font>

516
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,700
mission depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission</font>

517
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,310
is out you know you probably are lacking

518
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,250
in several areas and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop an</font>

519
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:16,149
action plan in order to get there and

520
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,580
and then of course execution is a large

521
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,550
large large part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this instead of just</font>

522
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,169
planning some piece of paper I don't

523
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,550
mean to de-emphasize the role that

524
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:30,430
getting it down on paper is but you also

525
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:33,159
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute execute execute don't</font>

526
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,990
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> til hundred percent do what you can</font>

527
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got a lot of people as an example</font>

528
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that asked me hey I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

529
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security but need to get my</font>

530
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:48,430
cissp first wrong answer my opinion what

531
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,870
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do first is know what you're</font>

532
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,970
talking about know what you're doing

533
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,590
developed skills you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

534
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,930
lab and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

535
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,949
interested in information security

536
00:25:54,930 --> 00:26:00,790
already have a pretty good understanding

537
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:03,610
of enough to start at a junior analyst

538
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,649
level and you learn so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more just</font>

539
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,919
kind of jumping in getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

540
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,840
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it eating breathing it all day</font>

541
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,030
with within your job you'll grow so much

542
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">faster than waiting and taking some</font>

543
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests you don't even know what you're</font>

544
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:19,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about entering the questions so</font>

545
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:22,320
that's just an example but execution is

546
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,320
everything yes

547
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
certification

548
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,320
I agree so for those who couldn't hear

549
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,379
he's talking about you know a firm

550
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,590
that's asking you to have your cissp

551
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,049
within 90 days of starting should be a

552
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,789
warning sign and you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking</font>

553
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:06,139
the questions of them such as what are

554
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,419
your mentoring programs what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

555
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do to help me be successful you</font>

556
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,520

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,799
did I capture that all right good one

558
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:22,809

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,150
bullets<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the trip right</font>

571
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:15,310
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I wish I hadn't so let me</font>

572
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure I captured this for everyone</font>

573
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,429
else so basically it's good to have a

574
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:23,740
plan but also continually assess and be

575
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,600
flexible with yourself and be

576
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,820
comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that where you</font>

577
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,860
end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be exactly i represent on</font>

578
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,050
plan and you need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even willing to</font>

579
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">change your plan did I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

580
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,899
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very insightful yeah</font>

581
00:28:43,000 --> 00:29:07,960
hey maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to be a weapons for</font>

582
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:10,879
graphic designers

583
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,990
let it be something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

584
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while to figure it out</font>

585
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:24,770
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable with</font>

586
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,660
yourself being who you are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

587
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:30,610
what you thought you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

588
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:34,730
doesn't pan out that's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

589
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:36,860
key to enjoying life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work is such a</font>

590
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,970
large part of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives so you know we</font>

591
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,949
do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be comfortable with ourselves</font>

592
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,470
I think there's a process that we as

593
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,140
people go through until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get to that</font>

594
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,000
comfort level so there's some thrashing

595
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,480
about you know in different directions

596
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,800
until you get there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's</font>

597
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,610
all just part of growth and I think

598
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,899
mentorship is really helpful to to get

599
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that understanding was there another</font>

600
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,830
question back yes

601
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,370
oh thanks

602
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:10,549
it sure so for anyone that couldn't hear

603
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:13,129
it's a comment is about really

604
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:15,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding yourself where you are in</font>

605
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:20,150
your career being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get forward in</font>

606
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:23,530
your career through but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font>

607
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,530
say would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key tenants</font>

608
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:30,500
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but let's just say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

609
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:34,969
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it isn't is just technical</font>

610
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:40,890
skills alone so yeah interpersonal

611
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">skills yeah</font>

612
00:31:40,890 --> 00:32:02,670
business acumen communication skills

613
00:31:43,700 --> 00:32:04,740
yeah agreed but you know it does it's

614
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,930
just an awareness that there's something

615
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">else that we need to address in our</font>

616
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,070
careers besides our technical skills

617
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,500
that's all and you know I doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

618
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be ninety percent of what we're</font>

619
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,000
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know maybe it's ten</font>

620
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,010
percent maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fifteen percent you</font>

621
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,510
would know for yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are doing</font>

622
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,710
this properly through a disciplined

623
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:27,750
approach maybe you set up a monthly like

624
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,880
one hour a month for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look at your</font>

625
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,220
career<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you are are you making new</font>

626
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,230
contacts different things you know with

627
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,380
your own plan and then continually

628
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,880
assessing it to find out are you on

629
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,550
track or DD to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Double Down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in</font>

630
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,780
different areas but yeah that's good to

631
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:47,100
know and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right about companies</font>

632
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:50,399
not really having a track for technical

633
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,939
people and so you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up getting either</font>

634
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,020
tap to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into management sometimes or</font>

635
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,860
you're just coming to work doing the

636
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,240
same thing so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult i</font>

637
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:05,120
have seen some of the better companies

638
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:08,280
create a strategist role that is maybe a

639
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,189
blend between what the business needs at

640
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,310
the moment opportunities that they could

641
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:19,520
seize you know combining that with some

642
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:19,520
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concepts so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good stuff</font>

643
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:43,240
so you become the higher yeah on the

644
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,240
back you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

645
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,639
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point you end up being a</font>

646
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,860
consultant anyway whether your internal

647
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,750
or external but the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those</font>

648
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,969
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't hear that becoming a</font>

649
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,490
consultant can be a really good way of

650
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,490
getting unstuck from that situation yeah

651
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,380
that's right yep

652
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:13,770
well good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on the plan just some</font>

653
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,168
things to keep in mind would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

654
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,969
some short-term goals so maybe some

655
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,589
middle term long term goals you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

656
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,089
figure that out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know think in</font>

657
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:24,270
terms of like a one-year two-year

658
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,310
five-year 10-year plan it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

659
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,659
different for everyone but the other

660
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing I like to encourage people to do</font>

661
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,800
is when you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your plan when you</font>

662
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,379
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing in</font>

663
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,929
life and in this field the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contributions</font>

664
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,279
are going to make and what your plan is

665
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,139
what I recommend to people is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font>

666
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,450
that plan with their peers with their

667
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,810
boss as many people as you can there's

668
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:48,359
no secret to it we all have this natural

669
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,159
hesitation to share in the security area

670
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,629
because someone might own us with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

671
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,520
information or whatever but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

672
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that aside for the moment you share that</font>

673
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else and unless you're a</font>

674
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,040
complete jerk they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

675
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,770
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you you know people don't</font>

676
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,869
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help others unless they know</font>

677
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,820
where which areas they can help them in

678
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,530
so sharing the plans a good idea from

679
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,160
that standpoint but it's also good for

680
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:13,050
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you hey that's a bad idea</font>

681
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,399
let me let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me tell you why and so you</font>

682
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,480
bounce<font color="#E5E5E5"> it around a little bit and you</font>

683
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,290
you can benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> from their experience</font>

684
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so this right here is what i'm</font>

685
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:31,589
calling the career cone and if you so

686
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:36,799
again sorry about the projector but what

687
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:40,349
it is is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice step over here</font>

688
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:42,599
so imagine that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever you</font>

689
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">are your career and this is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

690
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,890
so let's say we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete new when</font>

691
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:51,210
it comes to security so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> start out as</font>

692
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:54,960
a nude and maybe our end goal maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

693
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:57,869
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as a new that eventually</font>

694
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,630
we want to be a CISO at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

695
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:03,329
i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not advocating that everyone</font>

696
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:06,569
becomes ciss or anything but this is an

697
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:09,359
example so you throws and dude there's

698
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:12,569
some positions in between that or kind

699
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural an analyst maybe pen tester</font>

700
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:19,840
architect truth is you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

701
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> path but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

702
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,700
we could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> czar security analyst</font>

703
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,340
certificate forensics and lettuce burger

704
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,220
know some some somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in between</font>

705
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,440
there but the one thing as you're

706
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,080
progressing you should be picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

707
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,690
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences along the</font>

708
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,790
way you can give a talk whether it's at

709
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:43,720
work or besides whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write</font>

710
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:46,660
an article various projects that you can

711
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,290
have to be placed on so all of these

712
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,819
types of experiences along the way

713
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,970
should benefit you by the time you are

714
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,610
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-state and some of these can</font>

715
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,620
be real accelerators<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so if</font>

716
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:03,540
you're a new and you know you're going

717

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:09,340
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security leadership or how</font>

719
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,290
to manage a sock and put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

720
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:15,040
article on that and get that published

721
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:16,810
and you can refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that waiting down</font>

722
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,820
the road and you are applying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

723
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:22,910
ciso job so here 50 developed

724
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,370
hold us in your resume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going</font>

725
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make reference to a decade from now</font>

726
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:32,600
so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be developing those</font>

727
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,870
bullets right now continuing on that so

728
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,299
you have a long history of the top of

729
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:40,370
experience type of connections that

730
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:46,810
would be expected of someone in that

731
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:49,040
role does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cone make any sense is</font>

732
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:52,880
anyone into<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking have you been</font>

733
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,890
to the lockpick village yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm a</font>

734
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">big-time lock picker I love that stuff</font>

735
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:08,180
so another way I describe this cone you

736
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,850
know so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way to think</font>

737
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,680
about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you get a couple</font>

738
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,020
of pins just<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

739
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,109
can skip a few levels and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if</font>

740
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:21,220
you're very skilled at what you do you

741
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,220
can open that lock faster

742
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:30,470
next build your brand on this i would i

743
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,650
would like to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a</font>

744
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,089
workshop going on across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hall</font>

745
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,180
someone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know her name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is Krista</font>

746
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:44,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pusateri and her workshop is called</font>

747
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:46,190
brainstorming your brand and I will at

748
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,690
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation I've added a</font>

749
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,660
link to her website where you can

750
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,400
download that material so that you can

751
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,129
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you're interested in</font>

752
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,260
brand building but you already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

753
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,480
brand whether you know it or not the

754
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:02,210
catch is to be conscious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what that</font>

755
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,680
brand is had that aura of like self

756
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,420
awareness about what you're portraying

757
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,870
to others whether you're in the

758
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,610
boardroom or whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working in</font>

759
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,770
the server room with one of your peers

760
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:16,490
so how are you coming across to them and

761
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:18,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it appropriate because you know I</font>

762
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,629
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think we should just be as</font>

763
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,730
authentic as we are I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

764
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,890
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I wouldn't walk into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

765
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,690
boardroom wearing a t-shirt and tennis

766
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,029
shoes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do think it's appropriate</font>

767
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:32,510
here and that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a personal dress</font>

768
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,890
example but I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to</font>

769
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,990
understand a situation that you're in

770
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,100
and what the expectations are and try to

771
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:43,069
meet and exceed those expectations so

772
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:45,140
that being said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

773
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,420
authentic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you need to leverage your</font>

774
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,420
what's special about you your your

775
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:53,480
uniqueness and you know you still need

776
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

777
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,160
published giving talks whether it's at

778
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,750
bsides or elsewhere and meeting other

779
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,290
people in the community that's all part

780
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,060
of the building your brand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also</font>

781
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,400
put a comment in here about developing a

782
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,770
portfolio so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got off the phone</font>

783
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,560
with someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> week that has a very</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">active portfolio and what he's done is</font>

785
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,180
all of the articles that he's written

786
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,800
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thompson he's been in the news</font>

787
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,569
he'll he'll just have links on his

788
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,520
website kind of referring to that so it

789
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,990
can be conveniently found for people

790
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,950
that are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

791
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was a</font>

792
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:30,439
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> little idea that he had but you know</font>

793
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,500
the key is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a lot of great</font>

794
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,490
work and a lot of this can be fashioned

795
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,790
in such a way to convey what you know

796
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:43,578
and convey what you have done and so

797
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:46,040
it's important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

798
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">be tempted to think that that's just</font>

799
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:54,050
bragging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know just avoid doing</font>

800
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:56,260
that all together so begin to show the

<font color="#CCCCCC">world your value into contributions and</font>

802
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:04,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will pay off on building your</font>

803
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:05,570
network this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably one of the most</font>

804
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,570
important things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recommend</font>

805
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,609
in our field I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

806
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:15,619
relationships are everything especially

807
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:18,319
in in folks infosec so you know I like

810
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:27,560

814
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:38,480
critical for me and relationship that

815
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very important so</font>

816
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,349
I also said helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and marketing</font>

817
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:48,200
them marketing their skills is is a good

818
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:51,680
way to achieve some level of reciprocity

819
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,689

intention of them helping you back they

822
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,810
will if you can introduce people to

wait or beg for permission from your

and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to ask</font>

884
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:56,609
someone if if you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> pursue your</font>

887
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:06,118
and do it so if there's any obstacles or

888
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,999
entrenched hierarchies in your way I've

889
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,160
just encourage you to not be in the

890
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:13,769
habit of begging but be in the habit of

891
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:21,149
taking action have a bias towards taking

892
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:23,069
action yes that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried and true the</font>

893
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,029
gentleman says it's always easier to ask

894
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:30,538
for permission or for forgiveness

895
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:32,819
instead of permission so yeah so don't

896
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:35,759
ever give up on yourself we all go

897
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:39,239
through ups and downs and you know

898
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:41,279
continuing to move your career forward

for you I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call to action I'd</font>

901
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,160
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propose for you at this</font>

902

904
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:59,759
so these five people exchange contact

905
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:03,150
information with them and within the

906
00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:07,289
next seven days do something that helps

907
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:10,259

911
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:21,390
that there will be some fruits of that

912
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,950
labor the fruits may be on their tree

913
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:27,690
