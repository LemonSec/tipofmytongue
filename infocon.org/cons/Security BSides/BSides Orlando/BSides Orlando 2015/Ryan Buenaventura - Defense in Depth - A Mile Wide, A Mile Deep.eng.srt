people here are new to information

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,710
security getting into it or relatively

35
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:37,228
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you saw a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of college</font>

students yesterday so the talk my wide a

37
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,970
mile deep for some of you you're

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably familiar with defense in depth</font>

39
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,829
strategy already so this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,020
refresher but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was I tried to</font>

41
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,389
put in some tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tricks for some of</font>

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,220
you that do this day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> day out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,740
if it can help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what I like</font>

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,719
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when I attend talks I like to</font>

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to get at least one thing that I can</font>

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,940
take with me back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully I</font>

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,860
can do that

48
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,570
so colleague was sorry step away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

49
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">mic colleague was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preparing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

50
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,739
cissp exam and she brought up the famous

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,690
quote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mile wide an inch deep and if</font>

52
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,670
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean Harris book which I'm</font>

53
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,709
sure a lot of you that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken the</font>

54
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,780
cissp are prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it you know the</font>

55
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,110
term and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the exam and it really</font>

56
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is mile wide and inch deep she was</font>

57
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,770
stressing about this terribly stressing

58
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,100
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hired</font>

59
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,520
two and a half years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a junior</font>

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,829
analyst and she has come a really long

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,010
way really good with servers really good

62
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,450
with operating systems and just she

63
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,970
knows her stuff she<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hasn't had a</font>

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,290
lot of experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> with security so</font>

65
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,220
anyways in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last two and a half years</font>

66
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,310
she is easily gone a mile deep in pretty

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,760
much every aspect of security anything

68
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,920
that our team does log monitoring

69
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,109
vulnerability analysis web app

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
vulnerability scanning things that she

71
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,040
probably never imagined she'd do or

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,540
anyone in security probably didn't think

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were going to be dipping their</font>

74
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,220
hands into<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go into so I thought it</font>

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,040
was kind of funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she was stressing</font>

76
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,989
so much about this exam but it's

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,500
understandable because the exam is not a

78
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,090
walk in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the park the quote I always</font>

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought that was an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting quote</font>

80
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,079
that was used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of that</font>

81
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sean Harris book it goes as far back as</font>

82
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,820
1890 by an American humorist to describe

83
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,640
the Platte River it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large</font>

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,840
circulation but very little influence

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,089
covers a good deal of ground but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,940
not deep in some places it's mile wide

87
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:42,019
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> three-quarters of an inch deep so</font>

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,609
it's basically saying people know a lot

89
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,500
about everything but nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

90
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">given topic I think it's kind of</font>

91
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,920
interesting that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

92
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,150
describe the cissp because you're

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,929
supposed to know everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

94
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,930
certifying as

95
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:01,920
our field it's uniquely complex it's

96
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,739
multidisciplinary basically that whole

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,390
mile wide concept all these terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

98
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,160
here everyone in this room it seems like

99
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,170
the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in security already</font>

100
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,810
you've dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of these terms</font>

101
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:17,070
you deal with them day in day out you

102
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you eat them for breakfast these</font>

103
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms as well more or less going towards</font>

104
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:25,200
compliance new standards HIPAA there's

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of there's a lot of</font>

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,659
disciplines to cover in what we do a lot

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,610
of areas where we're expected to know

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,560
all this information or at least know

109
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">where to get it critical decision making</font>

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,870
another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our area</font>

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,299
uniquely complex if you think about a

112
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,260
traditional IT group like a service desk

113
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,520
let's say they mess up a service ticket

114
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,800
what's the worst that happens they don't

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,549
meet their s la's you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,580
level one junior analyst reviewing your

117
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,400
firewall logs or your sim and they miss

118
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,859
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> exfiltration in plain sight huge</font>

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,120
amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data what's the repercussions</font>

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that it's every decision is critical</font>

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,990
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're mid-level analyst even and you</font>

122
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,450
are called<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and check out a</font>

123
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,030
workstation to forensics whatever tool

124
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,800
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case ftk and you're taking a</font>

125
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,989
look at the machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you miss an</font>

126
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,180
indicator of compromise that you should

127
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

128
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">next how many marsh machines are going</font>

129
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,400
to be infected how many more machines or

130
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,560
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main pivot into the network</font>

131
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,469
everything we do in security everything

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,740
we look at it it's it's strange how that

133
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,810
is but one mistake and who knows what

134
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,530
can happen

135
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,570
and then when I say at every level just

136
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,400
think about going at the manager level

137
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,430
personally if I don't do enough to fight

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,370
for budget for training for my staff and

139
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,490
now they don't know the latest threats

140
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,880
the latest trends the latest malware how

141
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,400
to reverse it then now what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,870
mean we can't keep up with guys that

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,650
aren't sleeping at night that are just

144
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,030
hacking away if you go to the CTF room I

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,289
but I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were there pretty late</font>

147
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,750
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally moving all the way to</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top your sea level when they're</font>

I'm sorry the business isn't doing well

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,969
you got to lose your sim how many people

154
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">here would be in straight panic what</font>

155
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,410
would you do without us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in these days if</font>

156
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:40,370
you're used to having some we're

157
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:43,700
expected to be experts this is a I'm

158
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure everyone in here has experienced</font>

159
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,349
this where you know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,640
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because they can't figure</font>

164
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,430
you get all the logs you may notice some

165
00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:00,710
anomalies and they can leverage that and

166
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,740
if if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security right you really</font>

167
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,419
do become that trusted advisor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,750
know that can backfire sometimes because

169
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,820
something happens and then everybody is

170
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,440
you know of the opinion how did you let

171
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen you're the expert what</font>

172
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,730
happened there how did you miss that

173
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,810
we're paid to be paranoid that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">just talking about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the beginning</font>

175
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,320
uh Andrew rent up front here is the most

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,599
paranoid guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we uh that's that's</font>

177
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,480
what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> our job really unique in that</font>

178
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,670
our salaries is based on that paranoia

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,720
and how much we're paranoid I mean if

180
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:40,100
you I'll say this my boss always asked

181
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,260
me this question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sleep at</font>

182
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,670
night because he you know we have a good

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,110
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell him everything</font>

184
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,060
that's going on he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't understand</font>

185
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,780
everything he doesn't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has</font>

186
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,620
his own perceived risks but he knows

187
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,969
that our group has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay paranoid and</font>

188
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,040
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that's what he pays us for them</font>

189
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,720
actual risk and perceived risk there's

190
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,180
Bruce Schneier who writes a lot about

191
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,830
this to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> good quality decisions</font>

192
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,110
security professionals must accurately

193
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,599
account for risk and differing

194
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,060
perceptions every person<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

195
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,730
organization has different experiences

196
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,030
thoughts skills and it's your job<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

197
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,740
security evangelist to convey what the

198
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,530
real risk is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what they</font>

199
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,310
understand they don't understand you

200
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,929
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay risk equals threat times the</font>

201
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,790
you know the famous equation they just

202
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,169
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all right how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

203
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,390
going to get in what are they going to

204
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,640
do how bad is it going to be how's that

205
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,590
affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> my department and every</font>

206
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,539
department within your organization is

207
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,570
going to have different perceived risks

208
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:47,780
so that that's a tough part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the job</font>

209
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,140
to weigh actual risk versus perceived

210
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,140
risk

211
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,050
so based off of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that defense in</font>

212
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,570
depth strategy allows you to deal with

213
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,550
this complexity going a mile deep is the

214
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,510
only way to be effective in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense</font>

215
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,040
in depth strategy now the talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only</font>

216
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,390
45 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm not going to be able</font>

217
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,939
to cover a mile deep and all the things

218
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,770
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start to for</font>

219
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,270
those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that haven't gone a mile</font>

220
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,890
deep in certain areas and I picked a

221
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:21,310
couple areas in particular and a couple

222
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,630
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> in particular for this talk so</font>

223
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,030
what we're going to cover what is

224
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,130
defense in depth for those that are new

225
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,620
to it why defense in depth how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

226
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,660
apply it a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases and reasons for</font>

227
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,640
defense in depth non Home Depot target

228
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,040
or Sony I'd like to look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about because</font>

230
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,750
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I find I can most</font>

231
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,500
relate to I don't want to relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

232
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">target or a home depot or a Sony tips on</font>

233
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,090
starting to dig a mile deep for those of

234
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are new to it and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

235
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,040
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pick up one thing from</font>

236
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,810
this talk so what is defense in depth

237
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,250
it's a strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of adding layers of</font>

238
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,949
controls and safeguards so that if one

239
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,350
fails you can rely on the backup control

240
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,820
the most simple extreme example which

241
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,100
I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has heard of is you</font>

242
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,560
have to fire walls from different

243
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,990
vendors an exploit gets your firewall a

244
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't affect be and an attack on</font>

245
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,130
firewall a wouldn't get through firewall

246
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,240
be that's an extreme example that I

247
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,920
don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you will your</font>

248
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations have their strangely</font>

249
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,400
whenever I evaluate a cloud provider or

250
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,200
SAS vendor for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization I always</font>

251
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this architecture document and it's</font>

252
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,240
you know checkpoint and then juniper and

253
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,190
you know they're out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front and then</font>

254
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,990
you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask him questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

255
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,580
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you know what you're</font>

256
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,580
patching like what are you running on

257
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,340
checkpoint and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like are 29</font>

258
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,230
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here yeah why you go</font>

259
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,310
with two<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls but you're not</font>

260
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,589
patching them

261
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,540
so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense-in-depth it protects</font>

262
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,029
against and helps detect your attacker

263
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,930
every layer of Defense is a chance at

264
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,910
stopping or detecting because your

265
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,790
people are going to click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on those links</font>

266

they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get fished there's</font>

267
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,449
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of other talks that talk</font>

268
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for that to</font>

269
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,310
happen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you want your web</font>

270
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,439
content filtering systems in place you

271
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,180
want your IPS you want to you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,410
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that your people</font>

273
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,359
at the front we're not able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so</font>

274
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,560
how do you apply to fence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> depths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

275
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,970
consider your attacker and their

276
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,729
motivators because everyone is different

277
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,459
and you build your layers through people

278
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,140
process and technology people are

279
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:34,550
critical there are critical control

280
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,350
through senior management commitment

281
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,849
because you got to get in the by end of

282
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,880
your management if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

283
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,190
buy-in of your management then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

284
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,380
very very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> job to secure an</font>

285
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,310
organization because pretty much you're

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only person crying wolf your people</font>

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,279
state-sponsored espionage<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we see</font>

all the news with the White House Russia

306
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,910

313
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,640
recently with South Carolina you have

314
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,439
the city of Fort Lauderdale they create

315
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,529
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new law against feeding the homeless</font>

316
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,410
and arrest a veteran when he goes out to

317
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:09,570
feed the homeless I can't speak for

318
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,199
these counties but I can tell you that

319
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,330
in my organization no one imagined that

320
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,209
that was going to happen as far as the

321
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,790
repercussions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at dane county</font>

322
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,680
and you've got attacks that blocked

official communications their internet

324
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,890
their email some police and fire

325
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,740
dispatch services so just imagine that

326
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:33,600
there's this event that occurs and all

327
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,270

it's the county and when you undergo

347
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,089
whatever they can and in this case they

348
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,469
took down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things and that</font>

349
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:33,000
that's just a scary thought to think

350
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,910
that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out police and fire</font>

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,600
dispatch services city<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Fort</font>

352
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:43,069
Lauderdale so they set out the law

353
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,450
against feeding the homeless and

354
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,250
basically what happened was anonymous

355
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,990
posted a video on youtube when you have

356
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,420
a chance take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that video it's</font>

357
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,730
it's pretty interesting I watched it

358
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,740
with our Public Communications Officer

359
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,920
disclaimer i do not work for these

360
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,519
counties or cities and the first thing

361
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,620
she said was oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodness this is like</font>

362
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,149
terrorists how do we who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys</font>

363
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do we do and then the video is</font>

364
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,230
pretty creepy uh and then she<font color="#CCCCCC"> said what</font>

365
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,820
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gonna do with my computer do you</font>

366
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,779
need to confiscate my computer I got no

367
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,459
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're all right Dori uh so what</font>

368
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,839
happened as a result of that and you

369
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,119
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider that a lot of</font>

370
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">local governments and smaller</font>

371
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,060
municipalities they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

372
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:29,519
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of large security teams if any I</font>

373
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,050
know Fort Lauderdale was posting up for

374
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,079
a SISO for quite a while I don't know if

375
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,969
they ever felt that but what was

376
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,469
interesting in this case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four</font>

377
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,829
hundred thirty thousand dollars in

378
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,740
remediation so half a million so your

379
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:46,439
websites are are taken down

380
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">was also interesting is they made the</font>

381
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,440
decision they said you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut us</font>

382
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,700
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and shut down</font>

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,680
our servers so they shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down their</font>

384
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,940
servers which what kind of solution is

385
00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:00,689
that but 430,000 and remediation a

386
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,680
majority of it was consulting if you if

387
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this particular</font>

388
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,339
article from the Sun Sentinel or you

389
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,800
knew your own public records request to

390
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,150
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information which you can do</font>

391
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that with a lot of government agencies</font>

392
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:14,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of helpful</font>

393
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:18,600
information from that four hundred

394
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,940
thirty thousand dollars so this is this

395
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">event happens and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a sudden your</font>

396
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,480
sites are down and now let's spend four

397
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,610
hundred thirty thousand dollars to

398
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
correct the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> odds are they're</font>

399
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,610
going to get attacked again and I don't

400
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,020
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that four hundred thirty</font>

401
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,100
thousand dollars is going to stop that

402
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,569
attack that's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> disheartening</font>

403
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,430
especially if you're a taxpayer in that

of your ongoing research review you know

keep up with the latest DDoS attacks in

476
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:40,440
the ssdp attack which you'll always see

477
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:43,139
from source port 1900 it'll be UDP and

478
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
it'll be going to your web server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

479
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,190
they want to take down there's no reason

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,600
for that traffic take it out at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge</font>

481
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,400
don't do it at the firewall because

482
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,570
firewalls maintaining state you see if

483
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,810
you use going to jump up and you'll have

484
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same problem so do it at your edge</font>

intelligence those talker yesterday was

491
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,160
talking about how they print out those

492
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,270
guides that show you the typical signs

493
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,170
of the attack explain that walk it

494
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,670
through with them because you're

495
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,440
networking team is there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

496
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,790
sure things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are up there not there to</font>

497
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,560
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> those attacks but once you</font>

explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them they know the layers</font>

499
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,429
they know the protocols and then they go

500
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">up I can just do this that's a</font>

00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">five-minute change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we're doing</font>

502

pretty well with SD SD p now ntp as well

503
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,120
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen personally anyways and</font>

505
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,559
there are obviously several other ways

506
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,029
to do it

507
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,860
and then check with DDoS mitigation

508
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:46,460
vendors on what's offered for your

509
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:49,070
environment in our organization we have

510

two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different circuits for our egress</font>

511
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,710
points and one vendor has nothing

512
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:57,129
nothing they didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who to</font>

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,870
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I don't know if it was we just</font>

515
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,229
they didn't have anything and then they

516
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:06,139
sent us to their engineer who said oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

517
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we can no route which doesn't help</font>

518
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,299
you because you're down but what's great

519
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:14,029
about the mitigation vendors is you know

520
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:16,429
they handle all of the direct scrubbing

521
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:19,669
and allow traffic legitimate traffic to

522
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:21,950
still pass through so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either go</font>

523
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,899
to a third party<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got companies</font>

524
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,830
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prolexic which I think got acquired</font>

525
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:30,168
by Akamai you have doing it in-house

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,639
manage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a lot of other</font>

you know going in inches subscribing to

536
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:58,759

why I attend these conferences that's

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:08,929
why I speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of people when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

these days ten dollars depending on on

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,090
the size and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden now</font>

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got 150 thousand dollar fine</font>

find that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing it which is</font>

702
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,929

right in the main part but they'll put

716
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:14,259
it in the trunk but i can tell you

717
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,029
several incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had to personally</font>

718
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:18,480
deal with where they were followed from

719
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:20,520
our company's parking lot

720
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,600
to a mall to meet with clients and next

721
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,639
thing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come back to their</font>

722
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,059
car and the trunk is popped and the

723
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,710
laptops come on immediately send

724
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,149
awareness reminders when multiple

725
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:34,919
devices are lost or stolen that's your

726
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,270
it's your quickest way to get an

effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> message out because then</font>

728
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,960
people are already talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

729
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,480
they're saying oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goodness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten light</font>

730
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,440
once an arrow in multiple laptop stolen

from a trunk of a car it just it gets it

732
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,160
out there quick people stop doing that

733
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,809
they leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at work when they're</font>

734
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,790
meeting with clients and they just cable

735
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:57,418
lock it or they just don't bring it with

736
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,860
them process conduct regular audits of

737
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,140
your assets you should have a

centralized inventory asset management

we our group takes it upon themselves to

00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:13,470
create a spreadsheet and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

hire part-timers to come through go

BitLocker to somehow miss the policy and

751
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,710
we got to push that through that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,230
know there's there were some talks

753
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,600
yesterday about getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTEs it's very</font>

754
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:43,530
difficult to argue for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full-time</font>

755
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,649
position in security and compliance so I

756
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:48,360
get around that by calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> on college</font>

757

interns whether they're free<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're paid</font>

758
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,699
or using contractors or part-time<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

759
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,559
to just go around and do these things

760
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,970
where you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the time</font>

761
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deal with this you can't go touch</font>

762
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,070
every machine but they can touch every

763

machine

764
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,310
file a police report maintain your

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,840
incidents file a<font color="#CCCCCC"> police report you</font>

766
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:12,129
should always do that with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen</font>

767
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,530
laptop when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you eventually run into one</font>

768
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,420
missing device a second one third than a

769
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,460
fourth and there's a pattern that

770
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">develops you want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you have</font>

771
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,390
that first police report because when

772
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,739
you take this to HR<font color="#CCCCCC"> and legal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

773
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,290
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a serious problem</font>

774
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,000
here we have assets missing here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a police report you don't</font>

779
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,460
have this documentation it's not an

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-and-shut case and then they're</font>

781
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,180
asking you more questions and if you

782
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,220
provide this I also find that you don't

many different devices out there it's

792
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,860
hard to select one but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

organization owned or personally own

799
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,690
devices still have them sign off on it

800
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:30,700
because they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> County for</font>

data on it and depending on what that

803
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,320
that person does there could be some

these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things you can do and</font>

encrypt your<font color="#CCCCCC"> device's obviously if you</font>

don't enable pass codes and you can also

enable pass codes through exchange then

814
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:07,100
that encryption is pointless BitLocker

815
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,350

<font color="#CCCCCC">an inch deep hitting the spam button</font>

so people we send out monthly

newsletters on fishing basically we look

829
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,950
at the latest ones that came out and the

regularly and that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone a long way</font>

own people through a third party or do

840
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,470
it in-house<font color="#CCCCCC"> and metasploit has a module</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it with that or there's a lot</font>

of fish me a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different platforms</font>

surprised how many people in your

apply you got HIPAA you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI you got</font>

this year the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus is the Florida</font>

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,609
you're taking a look at it a close look

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really interesting because they</font>

942
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:09,100
basically take HIPAA and all the other

PII and data breach notification laws

944

that law but it could in there if you

lose 500 records first<font color="#E5E5E5"> name last name</font>

have to do a breach notification I was

956
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,009
never in florida before I think that's

957
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,509
that shows just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> far the laws are</font>

coming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more laws in</font>

00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:51,690
the pipeline I now communicate this law

960
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,910
and pretty much everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it's</font>

961
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:56,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot easier when you're a Florida</font>

explain to them the risks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fines</font>

966
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,030
and the repercussions and then

<font color="#E5E5E5">especially the requirements to do data</font>

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,330
in the active voice I've seen policies

awareness training that are in passive

974
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,540
you know your end users must do this

975
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,399
period whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big</font>

976

better what you're trying to accomplish

00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,940
test your employees before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and after</font>

981
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,560
your awareness to measure effectiveness

982
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,480
you can do those fishing campaigns I

983
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,640
find it really valuable to do the

984
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,260
fishing campaign before and then

985
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,210
implement your awareness training and

986
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,100
then do it after and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

987
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,980
effectiveness I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean honestly I think</font>

00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is by far the easiest security</font>

989
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,000
metric there is it's it's so hard to

990
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,490
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with security metrics that</font>

but this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands down</font>

no one ever questions that metric

they're like wow look at this you're

996

telling me 300 people clicked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

appreciate the time they appreciate when

you show them what the risk is and that

1085
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,730
goes with that whole perceived versus

actual risk

1087
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,710
they work with you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more I've gone</font>

didn't do much with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that</font>

with them with the vulnerability

1096
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:15,440
specifically review false positives

1097
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,180
that's an ongoing battle<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of</font>

1098
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,860
these tools open up tickets with your

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,060
vendor again I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

1100
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,650
start with your critical servers and

1101
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,630
then move out I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen in other</font>

1102
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,090
organizations they go and they buy the

new vulnerability tool they get 6,000

1104
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:34,160
licenses and then they start scanning

1105
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,540
like crazy and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no rhyme or</font>

1106
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,310
reason to it and then all of a sudden

1107
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're having you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Service Desk</font>

crucial to keeping your SCADA systems

00:44:53,870 --> 00:45:00,830
online start with those and then move

out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization use</font>

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:05,450
multiple tools to provide a complete

1118
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:07,130
picture every tool is different there's

1119
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,810
tools within web app vulnerability

1120
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:13,640
scanning database operating systems I

1121
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,990
notice every scan has always been a

1122
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,859
little bit different obviously they're

1123

going to always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the main</font>

credentialed ones missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft kb</font>

1125
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:23,660
this that and the other but use

1126
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,400
different tools we've used a lot of

1127
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,440
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools for web app scanning and</font>

1128
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,930
one thing catches<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cross-site scripting</font>

1129
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,250
another one doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and one thing</font>

1130
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,730
all son shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you have a sequel</font>

1131
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,950
injection it's crazy how the

1132
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,840
and they're all seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be at the same</font>

1133
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,640
playing field but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just still get</font>

1134
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,070
different behaviors and different

1135
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,460
responses from these tools and thus you

1136
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,830
get different vulnerabilities use open

1137
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,140
source tools before you run a commercial

1138
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:53,359
scan just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run an nmap scan first you</font>

1139
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,450
might save yourself some time what I do

1140
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,000
is we run the nmap scan and then you

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,060
is not easier for the faint of heart I

1157
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,830
think everybody here knows that it can
