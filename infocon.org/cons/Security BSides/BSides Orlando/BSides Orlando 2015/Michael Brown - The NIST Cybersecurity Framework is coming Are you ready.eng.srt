put either this talk it kind of made the

11
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,540
assumption that while there were

12
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,030
technical background with matrix pretty

13
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,590
some of the things that deal with

14
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,980
frameworks and controls or what you

15
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,329
probably have not been exposed to so I

16
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,500
kind of assumed a lack of knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

17
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,879
these were areas are going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

if you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I talk about it's</font>

26
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,160
be a fight have something I want to talk

a technical background kind of had a

very bright career and I sort off going

43
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,130
to be a certain software engineer it

44
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,680
went into system administration and then

into the security one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

i'll point out what why that's important

73
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:47,390
back in February of 2013 when president

cybersecurity it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know</font>

77
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,010
let's create a substrate framework that

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,039
companies and organizations can follow

79
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,450

<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it NIST which was the group that</font>

82
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,050
was to be to develop this they had a

83
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,920
bunch of workshop that they called him

84
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,750
in 2013 these were workshops that

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,760
brought together people from the private

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,560
industry from the public industry to get

87
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,409
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback and understanding of what</font>

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought was important they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

89
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,450
released the first version in February

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,850
of 2014 which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font>

91
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,440
framework is less in a little over a

year old

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,060
that didn't had a six workshop in

94
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">October of last year to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of get a</font>

feedback in terms of the people who had

96
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,099
initially started using it what what

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,180
they like with it didn't liked and kind

the report in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December of 2014 about</font>

101
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,140
what they got out of this workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

102
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,030
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing they talk about here they talk</font>

103
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,700
about these is critical infrastructure

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,750
it's like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heck does that mean</font>

105
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,890
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they mean by the critical</font>

106
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,650
infrastructure all these different

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,840
industries and quite honestly most of

108
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,859
you here are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of these</font>

109
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,210
industries<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're working in</font>

so for you probably fall into one of

112
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,870
these critical infrastructures what is

might be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming that are in</font>

you go to the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there they are</font>

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,900
as PDFs we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download them some of</font>

them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more active in terms of</font>

updating there's someone now they've got

149
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,400
into like a third or fourth revision or

150
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">some they wrote in 15-20 years ago and</font>

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,199
haven't updated a sentence so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">group that with that the government said</font>

153
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,490
hey you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put the other the</font>

154
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,530
cybersecurity framework I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

155
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,870
that anything that happened was a couple

156
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the White House had what was</font>

157
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,100
called the cybersecurity summit or full

158
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,850
and some cyber security and consumer

159
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,350
protection held its Stanford actually if

160
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,520
you're curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they cover it</font>

161
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,740
cuz they covered a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

162
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,329
topics including cyber security you can

163
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,850
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the White House website</font>

164
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,250
whitehouse.gov and you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a report</font>

165
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,450
of what they talked about and when they

166
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,970
was interesting was they talked about

167
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,940
the status the cybersecurity framework

168
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,550
and its use and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

169
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,170
actually pulled the other from different

170
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,880
sources center where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going right</font>

171
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,819
now and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it's convincing</font>

172
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,460
how widely has become you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know put to</font>

173
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,900
use already so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something just</font>

174
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">from this from the private industry area</font>

175
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:30,560
you have lots of companies are already

176
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,390
adopting the cybersecurity framework you

177
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,910
have Intel<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have apple yeah bank of</font>

178
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,010
america and what a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

179
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,150
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are also doing is not</font>

180
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,640
only they're adapting it for their own

181
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,829
use but they're telling their vendors ie

182
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,160
companies that they deal with and either

183
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:49,790
get goods or services from to say we

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,219
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this as well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

185
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,959
kind of its rapidly being adapted or

186
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,340
being put to use by a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,970
industries<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other ones are kind of</font>

188
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,640
interesting is a IG is using it in how

189
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,710
they write<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity insurance</font>

190
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,720
that's the biggest one thing I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

191
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,970
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are like oh we had</font>

192
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,670
the cyber security issue oh let's just

193
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">go get insurance to cover ourselves but</font>

194
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,760
what they're going to do is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,710
the framework as a way to assess

196
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,390
companies to see how good they're doing

197
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,880
in their security because if they're not

198
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,110
doing too well then they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

199
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,530
be charging more for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

200
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">insurance for them and the legal</font>

201
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">community apparently is looking at it as</font>

202
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,579
a way to set down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard of care</font>

203
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,339
again using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to take a look at company</font>

204
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,160
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say are they following good practices</font>

205
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,200
or not and if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not then they're</font>

206
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,569
not going due diligence you know good

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,570
care and which means that they probably

208
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,860
might be penalized for that that's just

209
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,150
private industry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pump in the</font>

210
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,180
government side is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing a lot</font>

211
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,550
of government<font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies are now using it</font>

212
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">DoD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doee department homeland security is</font>

213
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,170
using it

214
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,599
one thing is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> federal gun is also</font>

215
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,459
incentivizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to use IE encouraging</font>

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,540
more people to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

217
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like we're building it into</font>

218
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,610
grants and such like oh if you get a

219
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:08,040
grant from the VOE or FEMA they're going

220
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say and we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

221
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,290
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess yourself several state</font>

222
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,360
governments are using it those the ones

223
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,069
that i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen reference and some of</font>

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,019
these sources and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think is really</font>

225
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:20,790
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of insane foreign governments are</font>

226
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,379
looking at it I mean we created this

227
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,660
opportunity framing for our use within

228
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,269
the US but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funny that the UK is</font>

229
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,089
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the European unity is</font>

230
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:32,009
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC again when these</font>

231
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:35,699
things were is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

232
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:37,379
a way to tell financial organizations

233
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:41,128
that are hegler heavy regulated you need

234
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,050
to be following this so depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

235
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,939
where you're at you may actually be in a

236
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,319
company or an industry were there

237
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,519
already starting to push it so you need

238
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:50,339
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of aware of what the</font>

239
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,540
cybersecurity framework is because it's

240
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,720
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes through the letter we've</font>

241
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,920
already dealing with with our clients we

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,230
tech science coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say like hey</font>

243
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,839
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be assessed against this we</font>

244
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:05,639
need your help<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at our practices</font>

245
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,439
and see where we stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but we kept</font>

246
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,689
probably the framework what is a

247
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:11,279
framework and this is a term that

248
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:13,410
actually i'll be honest when I got into

249
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,699
IT security<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard the term</font>

250
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,040
framework that's something that I've

251
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,269
only seen kind of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few years</font>

252
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,498
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these concepts so I want to</font>

253
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure people are saying what we mean</font>

254
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:23,429
by a framework I think so there's some

255
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:25,589
there's some misunderstandings and

256
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,230
whatnot and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them which</font>

257
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,970
makes it worse basically it's based on

258
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,619
an abstraction assessed on basic

259
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,639
controls things that you should be doing

260
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:37,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your organization but it's meant to</font>

261
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,699
be in a very high level i saw one

262
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,920
article that talked about the cypress

263
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,540
tree framework and he kind of the person

264
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,979
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complaining about oh it wasn't</font>

265
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,040
detailed enough

266
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,199
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be detailed that's</font>

267
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole idea of a framework it's meant</font>

268
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,300
to be a high level you know basics of

269
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,130
how you set things up not getting down

270
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,959
into an indie gritty to tell you what

271
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,600
you need to be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

272
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,888
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a framework it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

273
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">misunderstanding about that again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

274
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,370
doesn't specify technical solutions so a

275
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,040
framework might say hey you need

276
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,529
antivirus but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

277
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,449
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement that or what's best for</font>

278
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,709
you because some people I say well we're

279
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use white listing and we're</font>

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,219
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know these are our</font>

281
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,170
antivirus products here and there that's

282
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,339
great a framework is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

might have heard of co so this has the

well kind of will get what you'll see

309
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,060
you know how it ties in and it actually

310
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of interesting way how it does that</font>

311
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,319
I pull this off the internet kind of

312
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,029
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've been by some of that</font>

313
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,410
is that framework this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

314
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,420
one we're kind of talks about the

315
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,980
different elements need to advertise

316
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,628
like scoping system model and so forth

317
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,949
controls of the term if you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

318
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,629
about and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't and I think a lot of</font>

319
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,449
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fully on here what</font>

320
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,279
control is I know if you'd asked me a

321
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,019
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago I would have stumbled</font>

322
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,910
through it because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

323
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,870
before even though to be honest i've

324
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,430
used controls my whole career basically

325
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are just a specific activities</font>

326
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,769
performed by persons designed to ensure

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,600
that business objectives are met<font color="#CCCCCC"> basis</font>

328

meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you need to be doing this</font>

329
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,180
you know to make sure things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are being</font>

330
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,740
done right and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of examples</font>

331
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,769
and probably guys probably use a lot

332
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,050
easier change management system that's

333
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sutton out of standard for</font>

335
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,139
over control we probably have these were

336
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,209
in your organization access control and

337
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,649
so forth but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of us i</font>

338
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,939
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always tell these are just</font>

339
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,319
policies but they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls</font>

340
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:40,029
that's the fun of a thats a control can

341
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,089
be a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be a procedure can be</font>

342
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,439
a guidance I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talk to me</font>

343
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what's my experience with the</font>

344
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,860
controls after I told them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

345
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,889
writing policies were treated for<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

346
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,959
and I sent much wonder do they really in

347
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:56,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 what a control is because those</font>

348
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,599
policies are controls now ideally if you

349
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a control alexia patchwork you know</font>

350
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,800
policy the hey patchers must be in a

351
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,960
certain form and so forth you'd like to

352
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,150
implement that control into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

353
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,570
what most of us do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in into the</font>

354
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,650
system where it forces you to adhere to

355
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,170
the standard when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create a password</font>

356
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,730
and that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement that</font>

357
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,650
control but it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> well could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

358
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a as a as a written document</font>

359
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:25,100
that says hey patchers we've been

360
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,080
created this way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I create a kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">example I said pathak have a crashing</font>

362
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,830
against malware that's the control and

363
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this control oxys this is</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobbies frame which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to pull</font>

365
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,510
them up and it kind of funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

366
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,150
look at these different frameworks how

367
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,590
much time they spend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I the</font>

368
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,390
cybersecurity framework only has<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

369
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen one statement that matches up to it</font>

370
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,980
where is with the critical security

371
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,490
controls they have a whole section which

372
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:53,180
goes into like about a dozen sub items

373
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,710
all about malware so kind of varies in

374
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,770
terms of how much these different

375
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,590
controls deal with different topics some

376
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,689
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-liner a do this others</font>

377
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,209
will go into like three or four or<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

378
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,850
or six more<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-depth I'd integers how</font>

379
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,980
much they think is important with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so</font>

380
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,659
they have a basic control but then they

381
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,740
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they spend like a page or two of</font>

382
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,810
other information kind of you

383
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,120
information and background lights

384
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,919
important and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice and so forth</font>

385
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,540
so it all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> varies upon the</font>

386
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,980
controller by the framework that you

387
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,530
make use of where your company is making

388
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,240
use of so the cybersecurity framework

389
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,040
this is actually the true name of it is

390
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,680
framework for improving critical

391
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,879
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security as</font>

392
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,790
currently version one it came out in

393
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,670
February of 2014 it's meant to be

394
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,470
voluntary at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point there is no</font>

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,860

397
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the case everything I seem to get</font>

398
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,260
an indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of things I'm</font>

399
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,340
hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the government what is they</font>

400
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,740
really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into our</font>

401
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,209
regulatory requirements so it's not

402
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hippo requirement</font>

403
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,170
where you're required to do it and be

404
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,120
assessed against it and so forth they're

405
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,370
more trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it out there and</font>

406
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,320
encourage it

407
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:11,179
doing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incentivize it as opposed</font>

408
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,399
to forcing you to use it it's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant</font>

409
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,450
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a one size fit all and that's a</font>

410
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with the again with people</font>

411
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,710
thinking of frameworks that everyone has

412
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,970
to do the same thing the idea is that

413
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,370
each organization needs to take an

414
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,900
assessment of them themselves what is

415
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,389
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them what is their risk to</font>

416
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,520
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on what's important for</font>

417
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and that's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really big go</font>

418
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,370
for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of</font>

419
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,730
have this mindset<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh everyone needs to</font>

420
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,320
do the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing without realize</font>

421
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,760
that no every organization is a little

422
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,470
different you know the threats for

423
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,879
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ordinations are different so</font>

424
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,470
some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defeat your focus in</font>

425
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,580
different areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so forth it's also</font>

426
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,620
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a living document they're</font>

427
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,840
going to be updating it based<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon an</font>

428
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,699
input<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usage and so forth so we'll</font>

429
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,620
see how that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just again it's</font>

430
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">busted it is little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over a year out so</font>

431
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,860
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how that goes the framework is</font>

432
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically has recommended three major</font>

433
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,570
parts there's the core there's the

434
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,860
profiles and there's the tears I think

435
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,899
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people we're focusing on the</font>

436
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,149
core that's the that's the kind of the

437
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,190
heart of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the core is broken been</font>

438
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,160
defined functions those are broken up

439
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">into categories and the further going</font>

440
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,929
into subcategories and then what's

441
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,639
really interesting is the subject

442
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,390
remember then cross matches those

443
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,590
subcategories to other frameworks that

444
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,690
kind of goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your question in terms</font>

445
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,530
of like how they match up that's what

446
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,660
they did they've actually gone through

447
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and said hey this control method up to</font>

448
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,090
these controls which is kind of

449
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font>

450
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:42,470
it's not meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be replacement you</font>

451
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">know they did these crossovers because</font>

452
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,220
if your are using it then you can kind

453
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:58,820
of match them up and using the

454
00:19:46,220 --> 00:20:00,470
conjunction right right yeah so sorry

455
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can you can cross mattress you don't</font>

456
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,619
have to go and toss out what you're

457
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,960
using it can use this in conjunction

458
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,389
with what you're using you know what to

459
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,350
think of what the thing is good and

460
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,939
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the profiles of tier that's a</font>

461
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,820
little trickier I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that and</font>

462
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,509
this is how its laid out you have the

463
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,918
five functions and they color code them

464
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:20,029
then there's about you cook divided into

465
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,679
categories would you go into

466
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,479
subcategories and they have the

467
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,769
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> reaver references this is</font>

468
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:27,470
actually how its laid out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

469
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:29,059
document if you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

470
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,179
this is actually that's the five

471
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:37,059
function they use these color coding

472
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:40,129
really so I protect attack respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> color</font>

473
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,690
identify is laying out the groundwork

474
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:44,090
for what we call in information security

475
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,830
management system ie and it's broken you

476
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,259
can't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a thing such as setting</font>

477
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,470
down your governance for IT and IT

478
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:52,549
security doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a risk assessment</font>

479
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,679
understanding what your risks card for

480
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,320
your organization you know understanding

481
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,789
your strategy to how to manage risk

482
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,340
things such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing what your assets</font>

483
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,049
are and assets are not just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

484
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,689
your computer but also your software new

485
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,950
systems and so forth and understanding

486
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">your business environments what kind of</font>

487
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">like lays down how things are and then</font>

488
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:14,059
it takes the next step is you're putting

489
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,220
in protection methods you know access

490
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:18,678
control and training and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

491
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,200
then detect well that's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

492
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,340
know monitoring and auditing and know

493
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,320
what the heck's going on with your

494
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,389
system or who's going to access your

495
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,840
system and then if something does happen

496
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:31,039
you have response yeah whether it's an

497
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,320
incident response whether you have a

498
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">disaster recovery had to respond to it</font>

499
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,220
and then once you've responded to you

500
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,950
how to get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running on your</font>

501
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,760
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's recovery what I do like</font>

502
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,860
is something

503
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,560
that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways and other friend works</font>

504
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,919
is if you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response to require</font>

505
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:52,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having IV improvements you have an</font>

506
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,950
incident did you do a lessons learned

507
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,330
have you figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what went wrong or</font>

508
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,330
what you can do to prove it and then go

509
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,399
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and improve how your act how you</font>

510
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,290
responding and how you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a</font>

511
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,050
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't always do that they</font>

512
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:08,540
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that post-mortem reviewed how</font>

513
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">they improve things but the subject</font>

514
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">rimac actually puts it as very explicit</font>

515
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,430
they want you to be improving things and

516
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,440
getting doing a better job I think

517
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,240
that's me is real important because you

518
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,490
know as we see things going on as

519
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,650
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we see hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

520
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,690
target got hit what do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do right or</font>

521
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,580
wrong so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do better in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

522
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:34,190
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's sort of improvements</font>

523
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:36,020
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really critical so I kind of</font>

524
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,310
pulled this example out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of help</font>

525
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys understand what it looks like</font>

526
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:42,770
so we have access control which is under

527
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,380
protection and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font>

528
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,990
the sub-q framework it's you know access

529
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assets are going to authorize user</font>

530
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,390
processes or devices and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize</font>

531
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,910
activities and transactions so that's

532
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,010
that's the function which is here put

533
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,500
any other protect the category is access

534
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:04,000
control and then it breaks it up into

535
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,810
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub categories number one is about</font>

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifications and credentials for</font>

537
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,659
authorized devices you know number two

538
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,430
is about physical access you know that

539
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">means things such as hey you have it in</font>

540
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:19,280
a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> room or you've got it in a</font>

541
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,470
secure data center three if you have

542
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,260
remote access controlled your people

543
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,330
dialing into your system and for that

544
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,430
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access permissions that are</font>

545
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,770
managed and you're dealing with least

546
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,770
privilege and separation of duties and

547
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,189
that is as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as it goes in the sub</font>

548
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,899
security framework it doesn't go any

549
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeper and turns explanation which you</font>

550
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,210
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some people frozen</font>

551
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,100
lawfully figure they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

552
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,330
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depth and whatnot but that's</font>

553
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,949
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the fact that they do they do</font>

554
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,419
the matching up to other frameworks

555
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,580
because then you can go to the other

556
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,860
frameworks and see what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say what</font>

557
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:59,049
they expose upon and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV go actually</font>

558
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:01,059
go deeper 45 is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network integra</font>

559
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:04,540
you having segregating the accelerated

560
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,129
networks there's another example again

561
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,320
taken from the cemetery or framework

562
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,330
this one is from identifying has asset

563
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,129
management bastard laughing six

564
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,168
different steps but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how they</font>

565
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,179
laid out the framework in the document

566
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:19,580
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about a function that had a</font>

567
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:21,950

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,419
the cybersecurity framework and then

577
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,280
take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what is different or</font>

578

604
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:08,889
the next element<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the profile which is</font>

605
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,029
kind of its more you use more for when

606
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,549
you're implementing the subject to do

607
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:15,190
framework and what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it kind of</font>

608
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:18,129
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay where do we stand and where</font>

609
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we want to go so they talked about</font>

610
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,850
the current profile which is okay where

611
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:27,940
are you for each two categories and

612
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:30,100
subcategories on with this control and

613
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,679
this one you know not too well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

614
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,360
here's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stand and then again</font>

615
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,789
you have to assess your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

616
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,139
what is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you you then set</font>

617
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:39,370
down the future profile where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

618
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,559
want to be for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those categories</font>

619
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,820
and obviously there's going to be a

620
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,889
difference mean where you're at where

621
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,408
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be so you do a gap</font>

622
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:49,330
identification and now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you</font>

623
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:51,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to focus on without him from that</font>

624
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,769
within you within see what's more

625
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:56,049
important and spend your resources on

626
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:59,820
and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how it's done then</font>

627
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:03,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a current profile your target</font>

628
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,439
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> read well no need to focus on based</font>

629
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,799
upon where you where you're at where you

630
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to be</font>

631
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:18,439
tears is really weird second I<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

632
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,270
don't know how everyone really fully

633
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,610
understand it I know I don't fully

634
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,070
understand it so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

635
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,659
almost like why and people were heard it

636
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,639
was basically a maturity model it's not

637
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,110
a maturity model and I'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

638
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,820
many people know what we mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

639
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,790
maturity model i'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

640
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:38,960
shortly but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really kind of</font>

641
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,920
important but it's poorly understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

642
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,500
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

643
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,610
just skimming over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point they have</font>

644
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">four tiers as partial risk inform</font>

645
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,889
repeatable and adapt and they assess

646
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,409
these tears based on the maturity the

647
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,240
organization in risk management and the

648
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">integration which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> men into the</font>

649
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,230
organization and then an external

650
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,820
participation that means how the

651
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,040
organization is participating with other

652
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,600
organizations and so forth in terms of

653
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,129
information you know passing on

654
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,290
information of getting information so

655
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,210
forth that's become a big thing nowadays

656
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,490
hey we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sharing information</font>

657
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,610
that we see so we can prove in six years

658
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,830
improve security so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maturity</font>

659
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">model again I don't know if how many</font>

660
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,750
people heard the term before and know

661
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,270
what it is but basically it's about a

662
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,190
degree of formality or basically how

663
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,940
good your processes are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

664
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,940
organization

665
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,959
ad hoc or what I've seen with IT

666
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,630
organizations it's the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

667
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,860
during what we call firefighter mode you

668
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">know doing everything by the seat of the</font>

669
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,350
pants you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you for is to be your</font>

670
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,809
building systems you build systems ad

671
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,850
hoc and just kind of like do it

672
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,740
differently so every system is not quite

673
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same and then when you go to any</font>

674
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,510
support work it's a pain in the butt

675
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,130
because they're all different or you

676
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,379
have it clearly documented and followed

677
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,420
procedure to build every system that's

678
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,220
repeatable so every system is the same

679
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,890
and then when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to support</font>

680
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">them ahead of having a dozen or two</font>

681
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,730
dozen or several hundred systems that

682
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,928
are all not quite the same you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

683
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,540
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> litter saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font>

684
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed you can easily do it dr. team</font>

685
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:20,210
that's the difference in having an ad

686
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,020
hoc yeah low maturity or no maturity for

687
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,220
a very mature organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

688
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,950
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really important because</font>

689
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,350
you know I know from my experience is it

690
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:34,370
if you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in an immature</font>

691
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,678
organization you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your be very</font>

692
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,909
costly for your for your company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

693
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,250
coming to get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tired of your</font>

694
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,440
organization

695
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,000
get rid of you and I for if you're not

696
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,830
doing the job that you're you're

697
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,210
supposed to be doing some maturity

698
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,399
models can be what we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

699
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">oriented and some are what we would be</font>

700
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,200
call process technology oriented one

701
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,820
that you may or may not have heard of

702
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,800
it's called CMM capability maturity

703
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,450
model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a rigid crated for</font>

704
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,419
software but then we started using for

705
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,880
other areas and that's what I'm familiar

706
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,200
with you know personally because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

older model or<font color="#E5E5E5"> save your growth model</font>

711
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,870
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process technology</font>

712
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:28,780
oriented we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think for IT security</font>

713
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:31,350
I think that's a better and some

714
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,160
proceeded to be more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

715
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,520
technology oriented come to their

716
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,590
maturity this is CM m for those who've

717
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,889
not seen it before it's a five stage

718
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:44,169
level and the idea is sort of level one

719
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,410
with your ad hoc initial but if you

720
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted</font>

721
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,520
requires management product<font color="#E5E5E5"> line and so</font>

722
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">forth you need to do all those processes</font>

723
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,800
well before you can be go to say it's

724
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:59,300
too if you want to go to 63 you need to

725
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,720
be doing everything it doubles two and a

726
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,860
total three and so forth with the

727
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,230
ultimate goal let's try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

728
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:10,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to level 5 which is really really really</font>

729
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,020
difficult I know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got level 3 it was</font>

730
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:15,610
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of time a lot of</font>

731
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">energy a lot of money to get to level 3</font>

732
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,090
but it was worth it because we didn't

733
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:24,970
get out sourced like other IT group to

734
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:27,649
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> company this is the other time which</font>

735
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,310
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> has their columns here through</font>

736
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:33,760
our policy formation and so for and the

737
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:37,020
assessment level

738
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,020
how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

739
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:50,470
which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is that in</font>

740
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:53,560
a CMM type model the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the top</font>

741
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:57,480
level whereas in the CSF model the other

742
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,480
one well that's not necessarily the goal

743
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">harsha would be after ad hoc or risk</font>

744
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,580
informing you have a better honey what's

745
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on you have things under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here a</font>

746
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,669
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better under control then you</font>

747
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,240
keep improving yourself for eatable and

748
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,070
adaptive and this is what's going to

749
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">need about the tears I think is that</font>

750
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:18,490
they do encourage you if you're at tier

751
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,860
1 to get to tier 2 but here's what I

752
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,410
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that find is interesting is that</font>

753
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,750
going to a higher level isn't something

754
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,820
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it depends in your</font>

755
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,300
organization because in a biscuit it

756
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:34,450
becomes costly in time and money to go

757
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:37,090
to 23 you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 and maybe for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

758
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,380
organization it's not worth it so I'm to

759
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,439
be staying it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too is where you need to</font>

760
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,440
be

761
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:46,219
so unlike with CMM where the ultimate

762
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:49,549
goal for almost everyone who does CMM is

763
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:51,710
a hey we get 25 that's the big goal in

764
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:54,049
the subframe were getting 24 isn't it

765
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,210
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big goal and this well thought</font>

766
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,479
was kind of interesting is that they say

767
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:02,629
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your target profile I</font>

768
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">get into where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be for all</font>

769
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:06,529
the different categories and

770
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:10,940
subcategories is more important than

771
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:12,950
getting to a higher tier level so again

772
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,869
I mean the tears is kind of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

773
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,539
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a strange part of the sucker</font>

774
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:19,968
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your framework I don't know if it's</font>

775
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:21,440
everyone fully understands it because

776
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:26,259
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot of information and</font>

777
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,259
even the document so

778
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,960
well that's house music<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all it's</font>

779
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,960
all based upon your risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> college new</font>

780
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,030
risk exposure is you might have a set of

781
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,320
you to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time yourself and that isn't</font>

782
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">it our frustration when you look at it</font>

783
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I mean it's not a fairly</font>

784
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking big document you know they</font>

785
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't give you a whole lot of guidance I</font>

786
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,820
think you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's kind of</font>

787
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:54,760
a balance between do we tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

788
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:58,450
what to do and then I restrict your

789
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,570
decisions or we made a high level enough

790
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are free to come up</font>

791
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:08,619
to what's best for you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

792
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,790
balancing act and maybe in future

793
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">version they'll have it those who look</font>

794
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,899
better will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out with lessons</font>

795
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,190
guidance and some suggestion and so

796
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,770
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> because again the only thing is</font>

797
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,550
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need your organization you know</font>

798
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:23,469
you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own issues important to</font>

799
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,230
Eurovision what the risks are or another

800
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:28,149
word addiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives it took a risk and</font>

801
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,949
so by understanding what is that

802
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:33,879
affected a lot of work or they should do

803
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:37,529
a poor job<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drives what is</font>

804
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,639
important to focus your activities I

805
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,649
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like it trying to be</font>

806
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,839
I think not trying to be a one size fit

807
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:47,848
all it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a make it flexible</font>

808
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,719
enough to fit different organizations

809
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:54,849
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we're like here</font>

810
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:56,469
is it too loose or croissant yeah so it

811
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is and I think one thing also i think</font>

812
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,560
what's going to happen is is you might

813
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,170
see people where they're going to come

814
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,080
out of her life you know hey if you're

815
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,320
the financial industry peers may be

816
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,690
suggested you know profile for you who

817
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,319
are in financial world

818
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,670
you know oh hey you're in manufacturing

819
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:17,700
this may be what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at oh</font>

820
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,440
you're in healthcare and maybe this is

821
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,720
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need or something like that I</font>

822
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,550
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's something I would hear</font>

823
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,618
in it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have see that where</font>

824
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,170
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it and</font>

825
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,990
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up or something my page you will</font>

826
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,710
samples and guys into one after that

827
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,709
might help

828
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,410
a little bit

829
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,939
and then you seeking that crossover and

830
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,180
what not even dhss i mean i'll mention

831
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,560
about this supports to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

832
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and over some of their stuff and</font>

833
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,670
cemetery framework so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

834
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:03,920
more and more of that stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

835
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there yet but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we'll see</font>

836
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,240
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the next year or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two as</font>

837
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,859
more more hard ization views and more

838
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,078
puzzling more or anything about our

839
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:16,400
partner to push it yeah they needed have

840
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:21,079
provided premium support it's not quite

841
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,329
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's coming this is</font>

842
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,790
actually coming acting from how you

843
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:28,339
implement it and their day was

844
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:31,040
prioritizing scope it you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to poker</font>

845
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,619
pro by ear where you currently at and

846
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,060
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know the framework and</font>

847
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:37,609
again it's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like the</font>

848
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,560
matchups with the other framework so if

849
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:41,299
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an ISO 27001 or two</font>

850
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,740
organization you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you want a</font>

851

we do with this

854
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,269
things we're not doing is that important

855

it really worth it was ongoing

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,850
improvement and everybody involved with

866
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,680
it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of us were probably</font>

867
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:28,970
down here imitation of maybe more here

868
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,830
but it has to be memorable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to</font>

come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a senior level say we're going</font>

870
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:44,529
to do this the business processes

871
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,790
ongoing improvements and so forth and

872
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:50,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's and that's a real difficult thing</font>

873
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:52,430
for a lot of organizations who don't do

874
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,379
if you will are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really mature in</font>

875
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:58,100
terms of how they are handling their

876
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,540
security I said I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment with</font>

879
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,950
policies and procedures you know we

00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

881
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it's like started turning it</font>

882
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:17,660
that step 1 so some of the resources out

883
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:20,000
there I think more coming again it's

884
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,529
moving out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little over here so we're</font>

885
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,200
going to be that we have some stuff but

886
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,520
a lot of things isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and I'm not</font>

887
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,040
really sure if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of these</font>

888
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot so we're</font>

889
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,599
training there is no official training

890
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,849
on this you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think there</font>

891
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,560
ever will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 20 about half</font>

cope with five oriented so that's this

896
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:52,780
is the only one you get a certificate

897
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,779
complete exam that's not a certification

898
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a certificate of completion</font>

00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">well that's going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

security conference in DC and october

903
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,490
and i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at the preliminary</font>

904
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,310
information they have and they talk

905
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:15,439
about how oh where have these tracks and

906
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,940
guess what they call the tracks oh let

907
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,819
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm good at each track and then</font>

908
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,770
protract track and a detective track and

909
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:24,290
am I thinking yeah where did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

910
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,480
those terms from me so it's gonna be

911
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">insane when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see the list of the</font>

912
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,770
workshops or the presentations at their

913
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,260
conference to see how oriented it is to

914
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,660
secretary framework

915
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,000
but soccer seem to be the only group

916
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind getting</font>

919
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,100
there's no certifications whether it's

920
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,660
whether it's good or bad other

921
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,000
frameworks do have those I mean with

922
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,129
cooked with cobit with a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> too with</font>

ISO 27001 and two you can get

00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,180
certifications like you can be certified

925
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,560
in terms of a base knowledge you can be

926
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,950
sort of quite an implementer of it you

927
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,759
can be a certified in assessing it

928

nothing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity framework and</font>

929
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,480
don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to change because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

930

the very book you know right into the

800 series they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally separate this</font>

940
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,840
close match is 853 but that's only focus

941
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,470
on the federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it doesn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have a total match</font>

943
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,860
yeah but that's again things more

944
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,420
tightly to miss the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mist 800 special</font>

945
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,550
publication which is for federal

946
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,820
government whereas the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Secretary's</font>

947
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:16,610
framework is very very new and it's also

948
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:18,230
you know meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for everyone not</font>

949
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:21,200
just federal government in sort of

950
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,700
private industry and everyone else so

951
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,569
now a lot of people do can get confused

952
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,730
especially when they're kind of familiar

953
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,890
with the 800 series about like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

954
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,950
well isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same it's not really</font>

955
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:34,129
I mean there is some matchups to it but

956
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,330
its focus on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different area well</font>

957
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,060
actually I would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summer</font>

958
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:40,549
period actually meant to be a broader

959
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:43,670
focus and because it's so broad it can't

960
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,190
be is real specific versus the other one

961
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:50,240
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more federal government</font>

962
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,860
computing in terms of books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

995
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:11,510
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'll see more and more of</font>

996
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,030
these resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> popping up but hey I</font>

997
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,859
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's only been a little over a year</font>

998
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:21,470
so we'll see as we get more and more

999
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:26,328
stuff out there version 2 oh I don't

1000
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:28,549
know I will point out that ISO 27001 it

1001
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:30,380
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five years between versions</font>

1002
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,380
like that we've only had it out for a

1003
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,770
year so I'm not you know I expected

1004
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,950
version 2 for another four or five years

1005
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more people need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it beat</font>

1006
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,720
it up you know see what works what

1007
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,950
doesn't work and we'll see where that

1008
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,848
goes these going to make conclusions I

1009
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,368
really think we'll see more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1010
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:54,290
people using it more uncertain more more

1011
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:55,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it what I do like</font>

1012
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,740
especially since they did the matchups

1013
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,470
is that people don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it as</font>

1014
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,979
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> either/or proposition they don't have</font>

1015
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:05,069
to you know if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1016
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO 27001 they going to</font>

1017
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:09,960
use the substring along with it one of

1018
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,119
our clients that was the case there are

1019
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,790
financial organization they already had

1020
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,210
built their information security

1021
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:19,200
infrastructure around<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO 27001 and the</font>

1022
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,050
came to watch because there are

1023
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,939
financial institution the SEC comes

1024
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,380
along and says you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be assessed</font>

1025
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,590
to get by against the cybersecurity

1026
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:31,410
framework you know so for us we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1027
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,670
the matchups<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know you're doing</font>

1028
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually twist I'm the one I pay it</font>

1029
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,600
matches up to you know these items in

1030
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,819
the subsidy framework how will you doing

1031
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,589
it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the few ones that like</font>

1032
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,470
don't match up because there are some

1033
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,420
that don't we assess them and say hey

1034
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">how we do on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one how you doing that</font>

1035
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,430
point and so it wasn't they had to go

1036
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,410
and throw out what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done it was</font>

1037
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:57,109
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like will layer it on top</font>
