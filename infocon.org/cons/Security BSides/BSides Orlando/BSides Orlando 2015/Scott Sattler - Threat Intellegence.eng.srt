that happen on blogs web pages things

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,410
like that but primarily a lot of the

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,090
who generates threat intelligence or

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,829
threat data there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people here</font>

55
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,079
and out there that are researchers and

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:41,150
intentionally good bad indifferent there

57
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,340
are out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there maybe they're looking</font>

by someone somewhere they're crossing

64
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,010
the internet and we're collecting that

65
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,950
data so some of your researchers some

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:11,170
review our security people innocent or

that activity right now banks are a

103
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,589
great target

104
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:54,409
you make a statement that is not going

107
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:02,149
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when we talk about why these</font>

108
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,479
people are generated besides money I

109
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:07,999
have a at a large retail customer forty

that's expensive eight million endpoints

154
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,340

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,039
we'll do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> harvest data from what's</font>

non-governmental that collecting this

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:26,349
well we do things

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:29,979
so threat Intel cyber threat Intel if

168
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,430
you're familiar with this this is a

169
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:36,300
sample of data that we see we see an IP

170
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,620
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great this IP address</font>

171
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,400
you're in law enforcement you should

172
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,350
track known associates you're committing

173
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,330
a crime we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to watch you you</font>

thing with IP addresses this IP is tied

178
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,870
to that useful not you know we could

179
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,940
tell that DG a type of infection Pat

180
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,289
otherwise it's like it could be the same

181
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,469
if we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into something a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

182
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:10,870
more useful okay we've got an IP slot on

183
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,419
that day<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the givers the kill chain</font>

184
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,479
face that's kind of neat for a crack to

185
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:21,430
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> great that's why I can watch this</font>

186
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:24,370
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> break you better know we saw this I</font>

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,300
helpful is that

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,529
you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your analytical track that</font>

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,870
down you know many things I get or used

192
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,240
to get my customers like let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> puck</font>

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,620
take that data and categorize it so if

that domain and if your handlers can

tons of analysts that can sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font>

companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are harvesting data a one</font>

intelligence database or its process and

265
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,990
we have certain strains that says you

balis and it could be pictures which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

269
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:21,990
hard so when you think threat

270
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,750
intelligence pictures places total

context

272
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,870
so it's a real headache a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

273
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,140
but once you have something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

274
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">working it actually works really well</font>

275
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,660
this was set up to parse almost every

look farther down but when you're

<font color="#CCCCCC">all this data coming in and talk about</font>

coming to come on your feeds you're

seeing all this computer we've got a

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,519
nice report we have my glasses on but we

305
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">have tactical intelligence we're being</font>

306

dated for maybe some vendor five years

has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process for an answer yet you</font>

the work or do we want somebody else to

312
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:17,860
analysis before we get it most

313
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:20,259
importantly all positive most of the

stuff you're going to see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy went</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to there and what do you do with it is</font>

318
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:33,910
attachable does it mean anything no can

319
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,189
you qualify know a lot of times you have

320
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,040
false data being reported to the threat

321
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:43,670
intelligence under it's all so different

322
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,319
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse stuff that comes in Wow</font>

323
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,500
I got

324
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,300
let's say 20 million pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw data</font>

325
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:55,190
coming in per day most of this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

326
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to act probably not but probably</font>

327
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:01,760
want to focus on on this chunk here can

328
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,700
be able to say management says six

329
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,819
thousand pieces of high value high

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:12,500
threat intelligence coming in affecting

331
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,760
us and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> paid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that so you want to</font>

332
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to say yes it took if we can</font>

333
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,490
children we correlated it we matched it

334
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:24,140
nothing affects us and we're watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

335
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:28,880
as much good metric<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of that you know</font>

336
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda where I look I taken 45 50</font>

337
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,340
different vendors I put them all in here

338
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,960
and go what am i eating my data from I

339
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,770
get some better<font color="#CCCCCC"> one minute I pay four</font>

340
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,390
hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bureau but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

341
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,910
is hardly anything they're just taking

342
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,189
the cash money just keep coming in

343
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,600
they're loving it so when I get that

344
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,310
metric when the renewals come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,310
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it absolute them bye-bye</font>

346
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,000
all right you saw some data you want

347
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,290
some threat intelligence if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:08,310
have any right you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

349
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead I can't tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

350
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">later if you guys have questions offline</font>

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,220
unofficial that public we can have a

352
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,420
discussion just based on my experience

353
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,730
opinion of where your money should go

354
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,439
and not go I don't want to get sued but

355
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,589
I tell you what I've dealt with a lot of

356
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,990
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can draw your own</font>

357
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,820
conclusions where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance</font>

358
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometime before you're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teachers</font>

359
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">over could you provide this generically</font>

360
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,890
speaking the handful of threat

361
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:44,849
intelligence vendors that we could

362
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:45,930
research from cone up that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up I</font>

363
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,820
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what's happening in</font>

364
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this industry i I've been in this</font>

365
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,400
industry for 25 years I've done sim work

366
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,470
I've done so the largest implementations

367
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,069
in the world for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many many customers and</font>

368
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,089
the most exciting thing right now is

369
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually being able to use threat</font>

370
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,880
intelligence because before collecting

371
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,770
this data and processing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzing</font>

372
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,990
it and doing it in such a fashion where

373
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,780
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have 300 people now</font>

374
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,300
there's enough brains computing power

375
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,428
and smart people that can automate this

376
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,010
and consume it and display it in an

377
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,089
actual fashion what's worthwhile and

378
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,280
this is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing such a big</font>

379
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,938

385
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:44,000

this to these people in this data boom

392
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,420
beautiful loved it some analysts had

393
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,040
already process it and had an action

394
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,210

409
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,530
everything stops everybody searches for

410
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,890
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's and we write up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a paper it</font>

there's all these different alert set

414
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,250
they come from certain sources and from

415
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,080
a political standpoint you have to drop

416
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,020
what you're doing especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font>

417
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,149
and say yes we search for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

418
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,270
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sony one</font>

419
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,770
the / marijuana we had some internet

420
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,700
site information on that and guess what

421
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,500
we spent weeks digging through every

422
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,940
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these acquired entities</font>

423
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,080
that we owned around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

424
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,700
sure that none of that stuff was there

425
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,060
but political standpoint they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say</font>

426
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,350
we look for it now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just look for it I</font>

427
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,639
said great let's automate it let's do

428
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,030
all this work we put in an automated

429
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,150
fashion so tomorrow if it happens we're

430
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,139
gonna lord I we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do that</font>

431
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,440

I say good they're only good if you hold

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,870
understand where the value is so that's

519
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,850
a quick let's take this latest threat

get it they finally get it when I like

715
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,570
doing funny stuff to them they get it

716
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:22,340
until this stuff happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your users</font>

so what we're using carbon black with

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:18,990
that so what you better start

738
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:21,480
virtualizing your outlook your browser's

these different applications otherwise

740
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,650
you can still get nailed time after time

you can search it you got it the

massive amounts of data French some data

1037
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,779
but we push a lot of that data we

1038
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,120
developed a used a solution what's he

about and one of those data elements

1041
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:29,190
that when you need so we'll pull in that

00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,109
write very great correlation rules where

00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:50,689
time that all together where you at 2.3

1088
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:54,079
million events per hour your son can't

1089
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:57,799
handle that you need a sip filter

1090

give them very actual direct and

1092
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,609
interesting intelligence but they could
