18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,610
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security realm so you do</font>

19
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,320
network admin since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm and keep your</font>

hands up for me so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now how</font>

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,370
many of you have actually ever took what

22
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you knew about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec and you thought</font>

23
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,320
about what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to do something</font>

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,440
malicious with that with that knowledge

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,090
you've got so I yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got i would</font>

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,860
expect I've got you know my pen testers

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,390
you know red teamers in the room

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,910
thinking you know yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that on a</font>

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,370
daily basis right i hack companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,309
now how many of you the sub your hands

31
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,500
raised have actually gone through with

32
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,030
crafting and intricate attack process on

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,479
how you would go about targeting

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,000
organizations exploiting them profit

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,170
izing off of that and then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,759
maintain non attribution through the

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,960
entire process so there's a couple

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,420
there's a couple in the room there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,330
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is this is</font>

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here I I thought I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fun</font>

41
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,030
exercise to kind of just walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,369
the process of a dedicated attacker I'm

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,590
pen tester and I compromised

44
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,270
organizations every week it's it's easy

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,960
as my co-workers in the back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

46
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,689
you we do it weekly what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,460
for is if if I as a pen tester or

48
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,979
somebody the security community were to

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,809
just wake up evil one day how would I go

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,658
about doing that so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to show</font>

51
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,520
you how me personally how if I were to

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,979
just wake up people one day how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go</font>

53
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this so let's let's have</font>

54
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,420
some fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this so some key focal</font>

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
points the stock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main the main theme</font>

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to find through this entire</font>

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,020
talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> non attribution so you know I on</font>

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,359
a daily basis i'm doing exploitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,230
organizations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spent a lot of time</font>

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,349
just focusing

61
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:23,929
on how what louder<font color="#CCCCCC"> louder scream ok well</font>

62
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:27,420
the mic doesn't have volume or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok gotcha</font>

63
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,709
so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's like I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font>

64
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,599
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time thinking like okay you</font>

65
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,769
know I we usually have organizations

66
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,840
that you know know where we're coming

67
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,629
from IP wise you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not doing</font>

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,430
real legit like I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not get</font>

69
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">caught hacking right so I had to really</font>

70
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,030
put a lot of thought under<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the next</font>

71
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,409
thing is how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up picking</font>

72
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,239
targets am I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to pick them a</font>

73
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,440
random am I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna you know say hey</font>

74
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,840
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like that guy over there i'm</font>

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,120
going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> target him and then</font>

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,670
reconnaissance right so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,810
go take open source information things i

78
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,940
can find freely available on the

79
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,040
internet and potentially find exploits

80
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,930
for a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just freely</font>

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,760
available and then the actual

82
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,790
exploitation stage right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,769
compromise company in some manner and

84
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,989
then eventually we'll talk about how i

85
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would go about profit izing off</font>

86
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,280
of it so real quick who am i I'm a pen

87
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,170
tester<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Black Hills information</font>

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,079
security we've got some of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers</font>

89
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,260
here i'm also a host of a web show

90
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,599
called hack naked TV where i talk about

91
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,418
random news things and rant a little bit

92
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,599
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then i'm also previously a defender</font>

93
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,919
so a lot of this talk I'm mainly kind of

94
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,660
putting on my defensive hat because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

95
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,540
really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not get caught right</font>

96
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,519
like so all of my my previous experience

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,750
with with defending a network and trying

98
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,599
to catch an attacker I tried to really

99
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">put that into this talk so a quick side</font>

100
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,720
note<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I thought was kind of</font>

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,220
interesting i want to share with you so

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,989
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably signed up on the</font>

103
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,910
b-sides website right you probably went

104
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,959
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know paid your money one</font>

105
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,760
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i noticed was kind of interesting</font>

106
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,310
about it is there's a picture on the

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,340
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i'm in that picture this is</font>

108
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,549
me two years ago sitting in Kevin

109
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,750
Johnson's keynote and so with the thing

110
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of amazing is that at this</font>

111
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,169
point in my life like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally would</font>

112
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,510
have never expected to be right here

113
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">today never like I I mean I was a</font>

114
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,069
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineer I'd never performed in</font>

115
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:16,829
a pen test never you know did any con

116
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,728
talks or anything like that so for me to

117
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,469
be up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> today it's like what the hell</font>

118
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,630
but anyways my point is like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

119
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,520
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years since then I perform pen</font>

120
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,420
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 70 different companies I've</font>

121
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,240
recorded

122
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Burnett naked TV episodes i've been i've</font>

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,970

124
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,820
conferences now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've written a blog</font>

125
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,430
post that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of kind of</font>

126
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,710
helped me get to where i am and now i'm

127
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,210
adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> keno to that list and i really</font>

128
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">have everyone in the room to thank for</font>

129
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,650
that because it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

130
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">community that has helped me make myself</font>

131
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,320
who I am without everyone here I

132
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,200
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be where I am today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so thank</font>

134
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:03,659

135
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,400
getting caught so before we dive into

136
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,020
how I personally would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

137
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,909
I'm not going to get caught let's look

138
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,520
at some guys who did a bad job<font color="#E5E5E5"> at not</font>

139
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,700
getting caught so Jeremy Hammond he's

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,130
the the guy that hacked strapper and so

141
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,599
the thing with with his hockey<font color="#E5E5E5"> or his</font>

142
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,159
problem was that he trusted humans so he

143
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,080
actually ended up getting ratted out by

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,300
the former anonymous member sebou and he

145
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,609
they you know the FBI busted down his

146
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,430
door flash grenades everything with it

147
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know salt rifles and what did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he do</font>

148
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,590
he immediately just closed his laptop

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,300
encrypting it forever so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

150
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,039
FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point they're like oh well we're</font>

151
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,960
never getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that right does</font>

152
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,220
anyone know how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did end up actually</font>

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,010
getting into the laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't give</font>

154
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">him that his password he chose a really</font>

155
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:56,190
shitty password and he his password was

156
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,630
his tats name one two three so you know

157
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,160
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this whole process like</font>

158
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,350
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encrypt my laptop I'm not</font>

159
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,150
hide<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the FBI and he choose a really</font>

160
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,110
high password so you know as somebody

161
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,700
who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at not getting</font>

162
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,850
caught I mean I'm you still got to

163
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,620
defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too you got some of the</font>

164
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,970
load side hackers you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

165
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,820
adding more members to your hacking

166
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,200
group it creates more problems right

167
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,580
like you have more communications you

168
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,400
have to like worry about talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

169
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,169
and not getting caught that way so you

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,789
know that's that's another another case

171
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,540
like trusting humans is not something

172
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,220
I'm gonna do you got Ross olbrich Dread

173
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,490
Pirate Roberts this is the mastermind

174
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the Silk Road so we're going to</font>

175
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,200
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross olbrich in particular</font>

176
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,690
here so dread pirate roberts because he

177
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,680
did a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wrong when it</font>

178
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,810
comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font>

179
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to list out a few things here</font>

180
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,759
bear with me boasted about creating an

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,410
economic stimulation on linkedin so he

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,539
basically went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> linkedin and said hey</font>

183
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,340
on his own personal account he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

184
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create this awesome website</font>

185
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,460
where i'm going to just completely

186
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,299
subvert the government so that's one

187
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,849
problem right one thing so he purchased

188
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,340
virtual private servers using his real

189
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,900
picture on a fake ID so he he could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

190
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,869
anybody's picture there he put a real

191
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,698
picture on a fake ID that got caught and

192
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,849
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like hey who's this</font>

193
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,650
guy the nine fake IDs um he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

194
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:19,919
stack overflow and ask for advice on how

195
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,270
to code Silk Road so like he would post

196
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,750
a question like how do i connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

197
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,008
tor hidden service using curl in PHP you

198
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,080
know with his with his real email

199
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,810
address not he didn't try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> office keep</font>

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,659
that at all he actually tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire an</font>

201
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,830
undercover cop to kill somebody you know

202
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,240
trusting humans again I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

203
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna hire somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody I</font>

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean maybe don't I don't know trust some</font>

205
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,039
random person he I don't know and then

206
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,710
he actually had a real technological

207
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,030
security flaw with with with with silk

208
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,250
road he actually had a vulnerability

209
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,719
where hit the public IP address was

210
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,039
actually being leaked so you know think

211
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,449
about tor hidden services you know you

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,270
can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect through it through the</font>

213
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,330
Tor network and that actual public

214
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,219
system should be could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hidden through</font>

215
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process but he actually had a</font>

216
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,610
vulnerability where his actual public IP

217
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,260
was being leaked so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI saw that one</font>

218
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,180
day like oh hey let's go compromise that

219
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,919
server our comp ensconce<font color="#E5E5E5"> cated um and</font>

220
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,680
then oh he accessed the Silk Road from a

221
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,659
block from his house so like you know if

222
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,970
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go run a billion dollar</font>

223
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:24,780
drug industry why do it right down the

224
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">road from your house alright so how am I</font>

225
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,840
gonna go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to design it</font>

226
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,030
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC first and foremost in my mind</font>

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,669
how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go about setting up an</font>

228
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,468
infrastructure to attack organizations

229
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,819
without getting caught so let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

230
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">avoid his mistakes we're not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

231
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust any humans I'm do it all by myself</font>

232
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,610
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build an attack</font>

233
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,020
infrastructure with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC being the</font>

234
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,970
first and foremost so how I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

235
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">go about actually doing the exploitation</font>

236
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,890
phase is all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

237
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:51,870
obstet driven and then maintaining

238
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,819
anonymity in both the real and digital

239
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,450
worlds and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I say the real</font>

240
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
world too

241
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,670
because let's say I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go buy some</font>

242
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,260
Bitcoin for cash you know I don't want

243
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person that I'm buying Bitcoin from</font>

244
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,189
a cash to really figure out who I really

245
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,280
am so even in the real world I still

246
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,590
have to remain somewhat anonymous so

247
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,300
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual set up this</font>

248
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real this is my infrastructure</font>

249
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,020
how I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go about attacking</font>

250
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,670
organizations and not getting cought so

251
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,530
here's just some some necessities write

252
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,969
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are absolute musts</font>

253
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,760
we're going to happen to have a laptop

254
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work from maybe some internet you</font>

255
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,560
know that help VPNs maybe some proxies

256
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,410
to route through some command control

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,579
servers attack servers and then not

258
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,459
attributable currency you know goodbye

259
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,140
some some gift cards or Bitcoin these

260
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,940
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the necessities so final</font>

261
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,230
laptops easy go to craigslist fine you

262
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's a ton of different laptops</font>

263
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can go by those in cash right</font>

264
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,510
that's easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> part that's kind of</font>

265
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,160
straightforward internet same thing like

266
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,319
we're gonna we're gonna access it from a

267
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,530
free Wi-Fi spot somewhere right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

268
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,850
that's the the the typical mindset my

269
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,380
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is to do like apartment</font>

270
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,550
complexes because then you get really

271
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sometimes you know they</font>

272
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,359
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like some hundred Meg</font>

273
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,469
download you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a starbuck to</font>

274
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,170
get kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crappy internet yeah here's</font>

275
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,240
here's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> key point so in my mind</font>

276
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,699
if I were to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a malicious attacker i'm</font>

277
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,990
not going to access my my attack

278
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,330
infrastructure from half a block from my

279
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,700
house like Russell<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burke did I'm going</font>

280
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go greater than 50 miles and the</font>

281
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,970
other key thing is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever going to</font>

282
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,870
bring my residence into the

283
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,060
circumference of my house so funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font>

284
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was actually a hacker that was</font>

285
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,130

286
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,270
attack infrastructure from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 miles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> east</font>

287
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,550
of his house<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 miles north 10 miles</font>

288
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">west various starbucks and the cops are</font>

289
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:42,300
like hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah he literally made a circle</font>

290
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,830
right around where he lives so you know

291
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,160
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was easy for them to go go</font>

292
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,100
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so you know when we go to like</font>

293
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,870
this place so we're gonna work

294
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,880
you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show up and like</font>

295
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">have like some like sock thing thinking</font>

296
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're you know being like OPSEC friendly</font>

297
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,670
because we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this weird sweater</font>

298
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,440
thing that's covering your laptop so

299
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,660
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC safe</font>

300
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,160
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get like some power to</font>

301
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,780
like sit out our car right like it a

302
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,329
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> little power converter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Getty yagi</font>

303
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,709
antenna and then you know have an alpha

304
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,940
card and then you can access it from you

305
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,530
know a good good distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

306
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,370
end up looking like this like a true

307
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:18,589
hacker like dude black hat beanie and

308
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,790
all because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you can't hack</font>

309
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,860
without either a<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat beanie or a</font>

310
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,349
black hoodie right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

311
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the</font>

312
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,860
actual attack architecture how am I

313
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,660
going to do this I'm never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">detect an organization directly meaning</font>

315
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,550
I'm never going to send packets from

316
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,420
where I'm sitting to that organization

317
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,150
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use multiple different</font>

318
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">bps networks to route the traffic</font>

319
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,709
through and in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font>

320
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,000
attributable we're going to need so

321
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,130
alternate identity isn't some Bitcoin

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,840
because buying the VPS servers

323
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,830
themselves is going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of</font>

324
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,660
non attribution in its own so buying

325
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,110
Bitcoin for cash is is easy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go</font>

326
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:00,500
find people who sell it around here<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

327
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,940
easily then you can actually buy VPS is

328
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,160
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin which is really cool right</font>

329
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,870
because then you buy for cat buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

330
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,089
for cash remain anonymous buying the

331
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin by a VPS under an alternate</font>

332
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,300
identity using Bitcoin then there's

333
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,550
really not a whole lot to kind of trace

334
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,260
back to you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point from from the</font>

335
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,079
perspective of obtaining your virtual

336
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,700
private servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the primary</font>

337
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks ism this is this is the main</font>

338
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,590
network setup right so I've got I'm

339
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,060
gonna have two different virtual private

340
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,800
server networks don't have VBS network

341
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,780
one which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a VPN server</font>

342
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,979
a management server and possibly

343
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,890
password cracker because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

344
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,140
to bring any of my my files that I'm

345
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,390
running or that I'm taking from an

346
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,350
organization back to my local laptop I'm

347
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,880
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to strictly keep all that stuff</font>

348
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,800
off of the local laptop just for

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,030
off-site purposes so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to crack</font>

350
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,729
the passwords will do it out in a VPS

351
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,079
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have VPS network to where I'm</font>

352
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,030
actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the primary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tak</font>

353
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:57,200
server and command control server so

354
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,670
connectivity wise VPN into virtual

355
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,990
private server<font color="#E5E5E5"> network one and bear with</font>

356
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,479
me because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a nice diagram of all</font>

357
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,660
this in a minute

358
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,430
SSH and<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTP or you know VNC to my</font>

359
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,529
management server inside a VPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

360
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,209
one so I'm not I'm not just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

361
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:13,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">vian seeing straight up to the virtual</font>

362
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,170
private server<font color="#CCCCCC"> network one because you</font>

363
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's you know having a VPN</font>

364
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're kind of limits the the</font>

365
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,639
availability of somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the local</font>

366
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,819
network from sniffing the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

367
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,870
whatnot so VPN then connecting to the

368
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,440
management server the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

369
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is really there to to to route my</font>

370
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,010
connections to the actual attack

371
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,480
infrastructure which we'll talk about in

372
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,500
a minute I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to route all of the</font>

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,699
traffic from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management server</font>

374
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,290
through tor all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that through tor SSH</font>

375
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,510
over from the management server to my

376
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual private server network to where</font>

377
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,620
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> my attack infrastructure and it</font>

378
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,550
looks something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so I've got</font>

379
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,440
let's walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got I got</font>

380
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,089
my laptop that I bought with cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bly</font>

381
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,010
booted it with a linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> distro connected</font>

382
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,380
to free Wi-Fi coffee shop somewhere I'm

383
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,699
VPN from that that Wi-Fi I'll to my

384
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual private server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network one where</font>

385
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,209
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a VPN server on that stage sure</font>

386
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,980
maybe even like B and C are<font color="#CCCCCC"> rdp to the</font>

387
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,380
management server and from there we're

388
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,019
routing all of that traffic through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

389
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,610
tour proxy nodes which you know you can

390
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,910
hit like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> three proxies there</font>

391
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,519
and then the ssh traffic from that point

392
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all going through tor into the actual</font>

393
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,149
attack infrastructure so the target

394
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,800
organization should only ever see two

395
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,910
IPS really that are attacking it they

396
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,719
should only ever see anything that's

397
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,430
Envy PS network<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

398
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,569
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of set this up this way with with</font>

399
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,130
torn the middle some people were like

400
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,599
well why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want you just</font>

401
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,040
connect straight through tor why don't

402
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
you why do you bypass this this whole

403
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,920
thing is you connect your tour out to

404
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">PBS network to well they've been a</font>

405
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,729
number of demonstrated attacks against

406
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,579
tour itself where you know you can if

407
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,050
you if you control the entry and exit

408
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:47,779
nodes you can kind of correlate where

409
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,430
that traffic came from so in this

410
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,050
infrastructure setup I've got it in

411
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,138
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different VPS networks which</font>

412
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,819
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know if somebody were to</font>

413
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,870
control that traffic or know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

414
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:58,459
traffic's coming from they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

415
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,069
be just led back to my VPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> network one</font>

416
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:03,349
which still kind of you know is kind of

417
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,670
a trail to go down at that point you

418
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,930
know there have to go to VPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network one</font>

419
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,069
and then try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where I</font>

420
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,660
connected from from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually</font>

421
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out that it was from like a you</font>

422
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a starbucks somewhere remember this</font>

423
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason I'm doing this is because I</font>

424
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,900
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep OPSEC in mind</font>

425
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,240
interesting that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not</font>

426
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:24,079
entirely sure because i don't have

427
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">control of a VPS network myself but one</font>

428
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,540
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tossed</font>

429
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,310
around the idea of so like let's say

430
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,900
somebody traced it back to tour let's

431
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,420
say for some reason they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

432
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,020
trace the Tor network back to my VPS

433
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:39,800
network one ear so a lot of a lot of

434
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,480
cloud services offer a VPS host and

435
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,510
they'll give you like a public land IP

436
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,360
on that VPS so like for example amazon

437
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,790
will do that amazon ec2 so if i connect

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,800
over the public IP or not public private

439
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,860
IP private RFC nineteen eighty ninety

440
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,349
from my VNC server to the managed server

441
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,180
is anything actually logging that you

442
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,100
know so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like once you hit the</font>

443
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,359
management server<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to see</font>

444
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,310
you know trace back to the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP of</font>

445
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the manager server but from there is</font>

446
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,119
anything actually really logging that

447
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,260
traffic inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> eps network one so who</font>

448
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,820
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trail might die there and</font>

449
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,189
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if somebody to trace it</font>

450
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,470
back to the the Wi-Fi hotspot<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will be</font>

451
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,210
at a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> one by that time so</font>

452
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,010
anyways so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know a lot of your thing in</font>

453
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:22,190
like damn like the latency on this must

454
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:27,050
be crazy well i actually set it up and

455
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:30,800
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that bad so I live booted off</font>

456
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:33,620
of a linux distro<font color="#CCCCCC"> i connected to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freak</font>

457
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,959
starbucks Wi-Fi I<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a VPS server</font>

458
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,270
that I set up with just literally just a

459
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,390
VPN server and one of the cloud-based

460
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,160
services I then V and see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

461
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,140
main main window you<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeders me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vian</font>

462
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,110
seeing to my management server just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

463
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,880
ubuntu box where i routed all the

464
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,110
traffic through tor so you can see you

465
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> got like the congratulation this</font>

466
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,870
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> is configured you tour so it's</font>

467
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,580
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just HTTP traffic that I'm routing</font>

468
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,610
through tour though it's all traffic so

469
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,320
as you can see in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to probably</font>

470
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know probably can't see it back but</font>

471
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,070
yeah it's not coming through a well but

472
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,829
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did like and that's that and you</font>

473
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,220
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual public exit node from</font>

474
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,680
tour as the ssh IP address so all of it

475
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,880
is being routed through tor so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

476
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,250
stage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks won't work out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

477
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,140
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit whatever else on that</font>

478
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,819
attack infrastructure and you know even

479
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the latency was bad you could all do</font>

480
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,119
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all on screen sessions anyway you</font>

481
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,380
know then if you lose connection just

482
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,329
connect back to the screen session and

483
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,480
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mandatory caffeination got</font>

484
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,730
to have caffeine

485
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,950
okay so now we've got our attack set up

486
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,760
ready to go we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how</font>

487
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,030
we're gonna go out targeting

488
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,410
organizations what is our motivation

489
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,899
well you can go after easy targets

490
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,250
that's you know easy right you could

491
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">take high-profile targets you know</font>

492
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,350
things companies that that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

493
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,760
like an itching to attack then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font>

494
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,530
contract targets you know maybe one day

495
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I might get paid just for</font>

496
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,510
targeting a specific company and then

497
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,860
you've always got vengeance you know I

498
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,950
don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> those guys so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

499
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,250
target them so let's talk about easy

500
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:07,010
targets first so i spent about 15

501
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,750
minutes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan which is awesome if</font>

502
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you haven't you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure Dan before go check</font>

503
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,380
it out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just looked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

504
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,210
unauthenticated VNC server so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

505
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,940
servers that are publicly available to

506
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,020
the internet that have a VNC service

507
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,510
running that does not require

508
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,270
authentication so now 15 minutes and

509
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,210
here's some examples of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I found so</font>

510
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,100
we've got a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> open windows server in</font>

511
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,320
Romania I think we've got a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

512
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,419
windows server in Taiwan we've got

513
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,429
industrial control system in Greece it

514
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,510
looks like it's like I don't know like

515
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,830
hygiene or something some middies like

516
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,920
some hoop coming out there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

517
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,149
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is but looks fun another</font>

518
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,340
windows server just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide open like</font>

519
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,010
remember these are not no authentication

520
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,120
of these are wide open on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet</font>

521
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,950
here's actually like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient health</font>

522
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,860
record system in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wide open</font>

523
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:56,780
that's kind of scary and then you know

524
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:59,179
Mac for good measure right vulnerable

525
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,160
services so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to just</font>

526
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just run a vole in skin</font>

527
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,590
against an organization and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

528
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,660
something that potentially might be

529
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,620
exploitable let's just look for publicly

530
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,440
available hosts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already</font>

531
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,729
exploitable so things like vs ftp 2304

532
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,400
which has a publicly available exploit

533
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,810
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit 130 servers on the public</font>

534
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,830
internet you can find what showed in

535
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:20,000
chico exploit him today or you know we

536
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,290
could look for high-profile targets

537
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,880
right like we can pick out the

538
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,110
enterprise's of the world you know we've

539
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the Haas hospitals you know the fun</font>

540
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,159
organizations to go target<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

541
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,480
know they might make us more when it

542
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,480
comes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> profitez a shin stage</font>

543
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,149
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got contracts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> targets so this</font>

544
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,129
is actually a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitman network on the</font>

545
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:44,340
dark web you can go literally by a

546
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,440
hitman for Bitcoin so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

547
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,449
maybe somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just contract</font>

548
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,120
targets out to me for for hacking right

549
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean why not and you get vengeance you</font>

550
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,110
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got mr. robot who you know just</font>

551
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,158
takes down evil Corp you know could pick

552
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,979
pick an organization just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

553
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like them so after we've picked</font>

554
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,460
our organization decided we're going to

555
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,899
attack them let's do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good amount of</font>

556
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,070
recon and to how we're going to go out

557
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:07,379
excellent we're not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw</font>

558
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:12,590
you know Hail Mary you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know DB</font>

559
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,390
autopoietic so information<font color="#E5E5E5"> disclosure</font>

560
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,039
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> nessus scan you've ever ran into</font>

561
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,929
it has information disclosure it's like

562
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,129
a low finding right well let's talk

563
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the more interesting ones</font>

564
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,630
how about an organization's username

565
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,360
structure that you can gain from

566
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,760
publicly available systems that's that's

567
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,439
kind of cool how about credentials in

568
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,690
previous breaches so things like

569
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,690
homeless can show you homeless<font color="#CCCCCC"> will grab</font>

570
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,429
everything from from any breach that

571
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,909
they gets dumped publicly to the

572
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and then maybe just like you</font>

573
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,919
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to know the external</font>

574
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network ranges maybe we look those up</font>

575
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,260
and showed in find find some some

576
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,789
targets do that we're gonna minimize the

577
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,500
noise we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> news sites like show dammit</font>

578
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,049
census to once again look for the

579
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,600
low-hanging fruit and find you know she

580
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,580
open ports we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> locate external</font>

581
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,959
login portals which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about</font>

582
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,760
that in just a little bit because

583
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,860
external log of portals if you're using

584
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,860
ldap authentication can be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font>

585
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,700
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about exploiting now so we've</font>

586
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,779
gained some information about an

587
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization we know is publicly</font>

588
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:17,760
available we know hey maybe this company

589
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,500
has vsftpd to 304 and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

590
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,820
exploit it or hey maybe we were able to

591
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">gain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the username structure and we can</font>

592
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,139
do some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> text with that so</font>

593
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:29,279
exploitation page let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

594
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,890
credential reuse so traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

595
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,840
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> or employees or anyone</font>

596
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,000
thinks about credential reuse people

597
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,789
think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using the same</font>

598
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,770
password on another account or for

599
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,500
example like maybe my I have like an

600
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,840
administrative user that has a separate

601
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,610
like domain admin account and like I

602
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,389
found one recently where the guy just

603
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,740
reused the same

604
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,390
password on as administrator account and

605
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">as domain admin account so they count</font>

606
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,480
the guys using for daily activity to

607
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,400
open up every email he's opening up like

608
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">every PDF he gets sent and you know</font>

609
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,330
launching every Java applet that that

610
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,810
account has the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords domain</font>

611
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,820
admin so but in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense what I'm</font>

612
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,010
talking about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

613
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,379
enterprise account i'm talking about the

614
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,540
the actual personal accounts of

615
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,000
employees so this gets in kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gray</font>

616
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,920
area because this is something that that

617
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,450
an employee owns outside of the

618
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,730
organization so think of like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

619
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,120
gmail account or<font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or anywhere you</font>

620
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">can go publicly sign up for an account</font>

621
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,879
so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we exploit that so i was</font>

622
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,020
doing a pen test recently where i found

623
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,030
where i submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> i submitted the</font>

624
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,920
company's domains to pone list and poem

625
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,649
list will tell you hey here's the

626
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,570
certain number of email addresses of

627
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,270
this domain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were compromised so</font>

628
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,280
this particular company had you know 157

629
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,460
for their main corporate 182 for another

630
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,399
main corporate email address and then

631
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:53,430
50,000 pwned accounts for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain that</font>

632
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,380
was technically their customers so

633
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,970
imagine the company like like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

634
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they have gmail right so if i were</font>

635
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,290
to submit every gmail address they might

636
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,440
say hey you know you have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

637
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,750
potent accounts or whatever or like an

638
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">isp where you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like at verizon's a</font>

639
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,320
good example they got verizon.net occur

640
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,510
customer or at verizon.net email

641
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,860
addresses so this company was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

642
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,260
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the fact that they</font>

643
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,699
had they had their own domain for their

644
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,530
customers so this was their customers

645
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,490
domain so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

646
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:26,070
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50,000 credentials of people</font>

647
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,320
who use this company how can I go about

648
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,210
finding out if any of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

649
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,550
employees of the company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they reused</font>

650
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,880
their same password on their personal

651
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,950
account so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did this is I went</font>

652
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pitbull pitbull is a great site for</font>

653
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,040
for collaborating<font color="#E5E5E5"> they collaborates a</font>

654
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,530
ton of information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

655
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">different social networks linkedin</font>

656
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,889
connects to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube like pretty</font>

657
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,710
much anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can find on the</font>

658
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,150
internet and we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

659
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,680
collaborate all that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

660
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,360
detailed kind of story<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a person</font>

661
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,040
that it can find on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so what</font>

662
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">i did is i submitted there's 50,000</font>

663
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,330
email addresses to pitbull and i just

664
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,040
grep the results for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company name</font>

665
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was targeting</font>

666
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,330
so these are personal email addresses

667
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and somebody said hey I work at this</font>

668
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,590
company for example this is manager

669
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:14,730
network operations support at X<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

670
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:17,399
right I got 250<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hits from this so I</font>

671
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,650
had 252 accounts there were personal

672
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,760
email addresses that said they worked at

673
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,380
the target company I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

674
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,900
target and outside their credentials

675
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,020
because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a breach so</font>

676
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,450
now it became can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just convert those</font>

677
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,129
back to the the organization's actual

678
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,020
email structure if I know their name is

679
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,170
probably first<font color="#E5E5E5"> name last name first</font>

680
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,850
initial last name at company name<font color="#CCCCCC"> com we</font>

681
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,500
go try their credentials on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ola</font>

682
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,939
portal and hey now we've got a valid

683
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,790
domain account just from credential

684
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,110
reuse on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal account so that</font>

685
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,190
won't that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech number 1 i'm gonna</font>

686
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,110
talk about three different attacks so

687
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,310
here's here's tag number two password

688
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,610
spring password spring is probably my

689
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,280
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i love password spring if</font>

690
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,729
you don't know what password spring is

691
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,070
traditionally when you think about

692
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,510
password attacks we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about brute</font>

693
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,580
forcing passwords right like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

694
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,379
to throw a million different words at

695
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,510
somebody's account and try to guess

696
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,750
their password password spring is

697
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,680
different as it will not actually

698
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,580
lockout account so when you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font>

699
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,630
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute-force accounts you're gonna</font>

700
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,770
lock out accounts really quickly

701
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,990
especially if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a domain</font>

702
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,030
authentication and you know got like

703
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,370
your your password threshold of like

704
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,810
five so you know you hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> five five</font>

705
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,659
attempts and you lock out an account

706
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,879
with password spraying you kind of take

707
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,660
the opposite approach you take

708
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,340
everybody's username in the environment

709
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,570
so everyone in the room everyone has

710
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,399
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own username i'm going to try one</font>

711
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,629
password against everybody's account and

712
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm gonna pick a good one I'm gonna pick</font>

713
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,890
something like winter 2016 or password

714
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,770
one and I guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I will get a</font>

715
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:44,850
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you in the room by using every</font>

716
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,800
single person's username so when we look

717
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,120
at password<font color="#E5E5E5"> swearing we just try one one</font>

718
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,580
attempt so I know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking like</font>

719
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,139
right so I'm an external attacker how do

720
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,500
i get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usernames how do i how do i</font>

721
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,910
know what to try at you know as an

722
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,280
external attack or internally you know

723
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,180
you can just run net users for / domain

724
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,530
get all these earnings from the domain

725
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then try it internally that's a lot</font>

726
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,190
easier externally though you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

727
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,000
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how that username structure</font>

728
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,180
works so there's a tool called folk up

729
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,490
and foga will go and grab all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

730
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,190
publicly available files from a domain

731
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,410
so

732
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,830
all the dot docx files all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel</font>

733
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,000
files all of the pdfs and it will go and

734
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,439
download all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it basically just</font>

735
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing Google searches right it's doing</font>

736
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,230
like like site colon company name

737
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,390
filetype doc and it will find all the

738
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,860
doc files and go download them the

739
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,960
interesting thing is that you can also

740
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,929
extract all the metadata from those

741
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,790
files so one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people</font>

742
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,330
don't do when they post things publicly

743
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:46,180
is strip all the metadata and if you

744
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,580
create a doc file or PDF a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

745
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,490
you have your user name attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

746
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,860
file so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these publicly available</font>

747
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,660
files that we were able to pull we're

748
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,750
extracting<font color="#CCCCCC"> user names and so I I did</font>

749
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:02,050
this on a recent test and I figured out

750
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the username structure which which I</font>

751
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,740
mean is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an easy username</font>

752
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,240
structure right I then took that

753
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,070
username structure crafted a list of

754
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,510
every possible combination so they

755
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,240
basically had like a like a

756
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:17,350
three-character prepended the three

757
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,330
characters prepended to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> names</font>

758
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,709
something like EMP and then they had the

759
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,230
initials of the user so something like

760
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,210
ABC so is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six character username I</font>

761
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,740
correct created a list of all those

762
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,180
usernames and I tried one password

763
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,340
against every single one of them against

764
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,440
an external portal this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

765
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,820
company I was doing an external

766
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,370
Testament for and then was scheduled<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

767
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,110
do an internal assessment later on

768
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I even got access to do the</font>

769
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:45,669
internal assessment I had 252 valid

770
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:48,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">coeur d'alene credentials before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I even</font>

771
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,530
touch the internal network so you know

772
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't a queue</font>

773
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,070
know as an external attacker getting

774
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,909
domain creds really the first step you

775
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,439
know getting getting access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

776
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,760
so let's talk about fishing fishings you

777
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,190
know known as what we call the golden

778
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,910
ticket to pretty much any network right

779
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,900
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two to four types</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

780
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,760
fishing i'm talking about credential

781
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,760
gathering and system compromised

782
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,230
credential gathering so the first thing

783
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would try to do is set up a</font>

784
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,220
external portal that looks like

785
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,230
something that users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already used to</font>

786
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">logging into something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font>

787
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe no a portal that they're used to</font>

788
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,700
log into every day and hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

789
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign it we need to sign into</font>

790
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh a portal to you know validate</font>

791
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,809
your new benefits for some reason that

792
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will do it now go try</font>

793
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:32,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">login and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they'll get you know</font>

794
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,449
login failure because it doesn't work

795
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:37,330
but we immediately redirect them to the

796
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual login portal so you know they</font>

797
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,600
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they just mistyped their</font>

798
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,309
password and you know nobody's the wiser

799
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,449
and they just know okay well maybe I

800
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">just mistype that and then you know</font>

801
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,220
remote exploitation that's probably one

802
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,629
of the more common ones we do sending

803
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,190
word document macros right like that's

804
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,449
the new the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new hotness right like</font>

805
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,940
everybody's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> where document makers</font>

806
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,409
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> riete ackers doing that</font>

807
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,480
because everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to just enable</font>

808
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:04,720
content no matter how hard you know they

809
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">say not to everybody just sees that</font>

810
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,649
button it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to press it you</font>

811
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,769
know there's no there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I can't</font>

812
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:14,320
press that button so all right so kind

813
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:15,999
of quick quick funny story myself and

814
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,980
jaw fire who works at our company as

815
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:21,070
well we were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fishing assessment</font>

816
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,830
for an organization and so we started

817
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing some recon and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

818
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,820
company did they did like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a national</font>

819
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:31,720
like walk at work day they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

820
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,090
do some exercise and at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> org at this</font>

821
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,320
at this like retreat thing we saw that

822
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,539
they had like a number of vendors there

823
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,539
from a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other companies like</font>

824
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:42,070
like clothing vendors and whatnot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

825
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,999
started off and I'll say hey what if we

826
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,580
just pretended to be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

827
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:48,100
vendors and you know tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send like</font>

828
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,869
a coupon and said hey thanks for coming

829
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,178

831
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:59,230
percent off our our merchandise at our

832
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:01,690
store so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> created this coupon we sent</font>

833
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,220
it to all these employees it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

834
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,980
like raining shells on us like

835
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,110
everybody's everybody's enabling content

836
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,639
and all right so the bad part is you

837
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,320
know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell that's that's in a bad</font>

838
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the organization but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst part</font>

839
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,830
is people were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like printing it</font>

840
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,408
out and leaving work to go like actually

841
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,519
try to get the fifty percent off so you

842
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:24,100
know we caught some<font color="#E5E5E5"> flack for that but</font>

843
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:27,340
whatever so you know we've gained access

844
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,719
to credentials maybe fish to user now

845
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,090
becomes how am I going to access<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

846
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network remotely so one of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key one of</font>

847
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,240
my key like beliefs and doing this is

848
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,249
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do any physical attacks</font>

849
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,200
because I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get caught I i</font>

850
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,720
think you know there's plenty of people

851
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,610
who do physicals<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test very well and</font>

852
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,559
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

853
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,760
to get into organizations physically but

854
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just feel like i don't need the risk</font>

855
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,890
like i can just move on to another

856
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,580
organization if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't get in remotely</font>

857
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,410
so number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is is to factor and played</font>

858
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,909
on a VPN like an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> on VPN if I got</font>

859
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,860
creds for user can I just literally just

860
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,200
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> P end of the network without having</font>

861
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,729
to have to factor is there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

862
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,429
externally facing our DP servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

863
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,410
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go log into how about access to</font>

864
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 up so all right that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not access to</font>

865
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,920
the network per se but hey fishing

866
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,990
across internal accounts is gold like I

867
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,250
find it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

868
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,340
somebody that's already like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna heated</font>

869
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,780
debate about one thing and then say hey

870
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,730
you know what screw you I'm click this

871
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,020
link right here and they're like hey I

872
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,640
know this guy they've already been in a

873
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,900
conversation with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna listen to</font>

874
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,520
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> imma click that Lake and like I</font>

875
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,530
said no no physical attacks so post

876
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,950
exploitation so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gained</font>

877
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:41,220
access to a network see the thing is

878
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,309
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with this this entire talk is</font>

879
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:47,440
for me we we get basically given access

880
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,809
right most of the pen test we do they

881
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,240
say hey here's a non<font color="#E5E5E5"> current or non</font>

882
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,520
administrative account on a normal

883
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,240
windows build or whatever is normal to

884
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,410
the environment go right so for me post

885
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,559
exploitation this is something I do

886
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,970
every day and it's it's easy and this

887
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular slide I'm going to try to</font>

888
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,220
boil down my entire b-sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tampa talk</font>

889
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:12,850
from last year into this one side so

890
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,980
let's go to a PowerShell we never have

891
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:18,309
to ever actually use external tools

892
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,610
anymore on pen test it's all all<font color="#CCCCCC"> all we</font>

893
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,320
need are PowerShell command line Group

894
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,418
Policy preferences we still find on

895
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,790
almost I don't know ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

896
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:30,220
organizations we find a clear text

897
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:33,790
administrative credential through<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

898
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy password files if you don't know</font>

899
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,168
what those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically organizations</font>

900
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:40,809
previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> could set up like a local</font>

901
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,919
administrative user via GPO and the

902
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,720
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect to the device the</font>

903
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,380
domain oh go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the GP 0 and solve any</font>

904
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,480
local admin the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is those</font>

905
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,280
the the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the username are</font>

906
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,720
available to the domain so that you know

907
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,690
new systems can access it create that

908
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,269
new local admin the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

909
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,789
the credential is using an encryption

910
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:04,029
key that is widely known so it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

911
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,710
go decrypt it so you know that's that's

912
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:08,080
one way that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> adnan on a network</font>

913
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,700
very quickly widespread local admin so

914
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,439
whenever you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not randomizing the</font>

915
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,580
passwords across your systems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

916
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,379
environment it makes it easy for us to

917
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,379
go pivot around using the same same

918
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:20,309
credential the local admin finding

919
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:22,259
insecure permissions on other systems so

920
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:25,210
something we find kind of common is

921
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,759
they'll like like an administrator wool

922
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:30,220
for some reason put domain users group

923
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,470
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local admins group on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

924
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,870
which means everybody in the domain is

925
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,250
an admin of that system now and those

926
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,768
are easy to find like you think like oh

927
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,049
hey like yeah it's just one system in

928
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,509
10,000 know it's easy to find those with

929
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:46,000
with a PowerShell tool called Power View

930
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:47,470
there's a script<font color="#E5E5E5"> find local admin access</font>

931
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,149
and it will go to every system and say

932
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,500
hey my local admin on you hey my local

933
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,629
I've known you had my local admin on you

934
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,669
and if you find stowe main users in

935
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:56,019
local admins hey I'm local<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd known</font>

936
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:58,690
that says now I can go pivot to it and I

937
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,340
can go obtain the the at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash</font>

938
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,230
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local admin user from that system</font>

939
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,070
and if you're using widespread admin

940
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,950
account then I get you pivot around

941
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,269
using the hash internal password spring

942
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,949
so we talked about external password

943
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:11,829
spring a bit ago but internal password

944
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,000
spring is money as well not there's not

945
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">a whole lot of organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

946
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,629
tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have detected you know we're</font>

947
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,300
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one attempt against every</font>

948
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:21,368
account and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times they're not</font>

949
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,270
they're not detecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff you</font>

950
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:27,129
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we play the the</font>

951
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,560
PS exact mamie cats combo hopping around

952
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,569
boxes so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we get get one local a</font>

953
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">democrat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pivoted at system run many cats</font>

954
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:36,429
maybe maybe get another user's

955
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,929
credential that we can use to gain

956
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,639
access to another<font color="#CCCCCC"> system a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

957
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,579
we use a tool called user hunter which

958
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,560
helps us find where specific users of

959
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:46,119
groups are logged into certain systems

960
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,940
on the network so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example domain</font>

961
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,919
admins we with with user hunter you can

962
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,480
say hey every system on the network do

963
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,219
you have a domain admin logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

964
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,690
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admin credential i</font>

965
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">should pivot of that system run mini</font>

966
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,790
cats and dump that domain admins

967
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:02,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">clear-text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credential from memory so</font>

968
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,079
then becomes you know looting right like

969
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,220
I've compromised an organization got da

970
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,680
our favorite thing to do is pivoted the

971
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,580
DC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump all the hashes because it's</font>

972
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to crack every</font>

973
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,100
bodies password and domain my my new

974
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,720
favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is to find vcenter</font>

975
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,360
servers or any sort of virtualization

976
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,890
engine and and show like a screenshot of

977
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,990
me logged in to vcenter as a domain

978
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,879
admin and say hey look at all these

979
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,140
awesome servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have access to and all</font>

980
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,370
right so the best thing about vcenter is

981
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,799
when you get a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good sysadmin</font>

982
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,299
because they organize the crap out of it

983
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right like they've got here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my sequel</font>

984
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,110
servers here's my my exchange

985
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,990
environment here's all the the web

986
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">service use my dmz um you know it's</font>

987
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,870
beautiful right because then you know as

988
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,160
an attacker you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have to</font>

989
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,480
like work that hard to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

990
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,020
everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore it's just handed</font>

991
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,700
off of me the other thing with with

992
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,680
vcenter to is a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people or a lot</font>

993
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">of organizations think you know I've got</font>

994
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">this awesome you know pci environment</font>

995
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,290
you can only get to through you know

996
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,170
through through a jump jump system on

997
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,810
our DP from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain IP at like 5 p.m.</font>

998
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,040
on a thursday and you good log in to

999
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,130
vcenter and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh hey i can</font>

1000
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,600
just console right to that so completely

1001
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,140
bypassing all the firewall rules that

1002
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,339
you might think are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

1003
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,339
now we get to the prophet Isaiah say

1004
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,450
we've taken over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company we've got</font>

1005
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,970
access to vcenter we dumped all the

1006
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,310
creds from from a domain how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1007
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,980
about turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the actual hard cash</font>

1008
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:30,190
right like an attacker this is something

1009
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it pretty great deal</font>

1010
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,600
about and yeah well let's just go

1011
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">through so turn to cover is a couch here</font>

1012
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,630
here are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we could</font>

1013
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly do we can be Carver right like</font>

1014
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,930
we go install point-of-sale malware on

1015
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,790
all the card systems in the environment

1016
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to kinda like the target hat</font>

1017
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,090
hack right like try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just exfiltrate</font>

1018
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,250
card numbers scrape them all from memory

1019
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,780
on the system we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can try to do just</font>

1020
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,030
identity theft you know if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that</font>

1021
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,800
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want attack hospitals or any any</font>

1022
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:57,160
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of you</font>

1023
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,550
know thi aur ki I I go see all that

1024
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,870
an identity theft right ransomware this

1025
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,280
seems to be the new hotness right like

1026
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,390
everybody's everybody's doing ransomware

1027
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,980
these days and you know they're making

1028
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:10,720
probably get bit of money of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1029
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,700
it's in the news every day now and then

1030
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you could be activists do you</font>

1031
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,830
just go screw with companies why not so

1032
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,650
I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> this news article the other day or</font>

1033
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,779
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's like last month now about</font>

1034
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,380
how Apple employees were being offered

1035
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">liked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1036
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,279
three grand just for their credential

1037
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:30,970
just for their credential to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log into</font>

1038
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:32,529
the Apple network so to me I'm thinking

1039
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,359
like okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go set up this crazy</font>

1040
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:36,309
Carter infrastructure and like have to

1041
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:40,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">have like all this you know other</font>

1042
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:43,630
technologically installed tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1043
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to have like probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a command</font>

1044
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,319
control server that stays up<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1045
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,210
time to have like you know the hit backs

1046
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,339
from from the Carter network but what if

1047
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just go sell the creds that i get from</font>

1048
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,259
hacking a company to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carters</font>

1049
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,150
themselves you know if they're paying

1050
00:37:56,259 --> 00:38:00,190
upwards of twenty three grand why not

1051
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,569
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go do that why not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just let me do</font>

1052
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,720
what I do every week compromise an

1053
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:06,788
organization get domain creds you know

1054
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,288
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just like basic creds right</font>

1055
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:10,599
like they're just offering like middle

1056
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:12,519
management 23 grand for their creds but

1057
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,809
hey what if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to this same people</font>

1058
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,149
it said hey I gotta do me an admin at

1059
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:18,250
this company<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you would assume</font>

1060
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,460
maybe like 50 100 grand for each one of

1061
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,079
those so here's the tricky part yes I

1062
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,450
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce Schneier quota my my talk of</font>

1063
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,339
sorry i'm mridu<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it</font>

1064
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,629
fits perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we find</font>

1065
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:30,670
criminals like this through cyber

1066
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,200
forensics we get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real world</font>

1067
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,119
when they do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid it's</font>

1068
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,339
invariably how it works getting credit

1069
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,420
cards is easy turning it into cash is

1070
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:41,980
hard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to this point and it</font>

1071
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,170
really is hard like I really thought

1072
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,670
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the guys</font>

1073
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,019
are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ransomware and there you know</font>

1074
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,240
these other other attackers that are

1075
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:51,368
accepting Bitcoin as payment are

1076
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,930
figuring out a way to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out so</font>

1077
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:55,269
bitcoin is probably the obvious choice

1078
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,460
right like to go with initially but

1079
00:38:55,269 --> 00:39:00,519
there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> major problems bitcoin is</font>

1080
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,319
not untraceable and turning large amount

1081
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin and to cash is really hard</font>

1082
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,710
like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a hundred grand a</font>

1083
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin and try to sell that to somebody</font>

1084
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,119
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna cause cause kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a blip</font>

1085
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:12,460
right so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things to look at</font>

1086
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,480
for Bitcoin you can go to block chain

1087
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,740
dot info and look at all the

1088
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,569
transactions I've ever happened on the

1089
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">block chain so the ledger of all the</font>

1090
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:20,440
transactions and then there's a cycle

1091
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,089
blocks here that will let you kind of

1092
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,000
trace it back a little easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

1093
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:26,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">visually so for example this this one</font>

1094
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,769
transaction was 3.4 million dollars in

1095
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:31,900
Bitcoin somebody I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I traced it</font>

1096
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:33,640
back to a mixer service which you know

1097
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that seems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the obvious choice right</font>

1098
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,000
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> goga mix the bitcoins and hopefully</font>

1099
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,529
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

1100
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,870
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> killed the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trail but they're</font>

1101
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:44,680
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> risked their you know eventually</font>

1102
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it becomes money laundering and I i</font>

1103
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,009
didn't travel down that road yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1104
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,800
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't want to go down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1105
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,600
path of you know walking you guys

1106
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,070
through hey this is how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> go money you</font>

1107
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:00,190
no longer a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so so my</font>

1108
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:03,630
attack trail kind of stops here so if

1109
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,630
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the research go ahead</font>

1110
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,970
yeah so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we get through this</font>

1111
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,580
whole process full rip in the place of

1112
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,560
everything buy a new laptop you know get

1113
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,910
all the new VPS servers and then start

1114
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,970
over again next week because to be

1115
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,799
honest so from the time it took me to

1116
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,819
set up that that virtual private server

1117
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,360
network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1118
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:28,300
3-4 hours to set that up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we get</font>

1119
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,860
access to an organization it's less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1120
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,980
a day before we're getting domain admin

1121
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,010
in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases so this this entire</font>

1122
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,350
operation happens in a week and then

1123
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're done with it strapped all that go</font>

1124
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:44,020
to different hot spots get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1125
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">rebuilt from scratch so let's fade back</font>

1126
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,120
a little bit let's come back to to the

1127
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:51,910
white hat a little bit why don't I do

1128
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,390
this well first and foremost ethics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1129
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:57,129
just personally want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more of a</font>

1130
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,960
help to the Security Committee I don't

1131
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:02,290
want I don't want to be a detriment I

1132
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a better a better world</font>

1133
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:07,420
for my kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't want to</font>

1134
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,030
screw over companies I want help

1135
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,230
companies and then there's the

1136
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,430
inevitability of getting caught like you

1137
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,130
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that thought in the back of</font>

1138
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,930
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind like hey you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I mean I</font>

1139
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,550
guarantee most of you learn probably

1140
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,529
picked out a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of holes in my entire</font>

1141
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,640
attack story today I bet a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

1142
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,720
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how can I catch the guy oh</font>

1143
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,700
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would've caught him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right there</font>

1144
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,950
and so I'm probably missing something

1145
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,049
anyway right so you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

1146
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,160
that inevitability being caught and then

1147
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,470
there's the danger<font color="#E5E5E5"> of entering the</font>

1148
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,759
criminal world right like in order for

1149
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,020
me to go sell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin I'm gonna have</font>

1150
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to meet some drug dealers or</font>

1151
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,790
something and like ghosts try to like do

1152
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:43,299
some like shady deals and yeah that is

1153
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:45,160
not for me but we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font>

1154
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,210
everybody everybody that has any sort of

1155
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">touched on the security security</font>

1156
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,020
community which most of you raise your

1157
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,810
hands we can all do this so I'm gonna

1158
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,540
leave you with two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1159
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,410
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about defenders first</font>

1160
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,900
we need to shift our focus from

1161
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,700
attribution to detection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevention</font>

1162
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,440
so I was I was walking through this this

1163
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,419
talk with one of my buddies who's a

1164
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,580
security engineer at a company and he

1165
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,970
basically pointed out he said so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1166
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if I had if I had to factor on my</font>

1167
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,680
external portals or if I had if I had

1168
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,870
more logging to detect you into doing

1169
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,730
password spraying you would have

1170
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,410
probably stopped there right because you

1171
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,910
know like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to do if</font>

1172
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can't access the network remotely I</font>

1173
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,710
can't do phishing attacks if I can't

1174
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,780
password spray if I can't just log into

1175
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,550
a portal remotely I probably probably

1176
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,200
stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right I mean short of</font>

1177
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,630
having publicly available exploits for

1178
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,689
certain services because that's you know

1179
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,580
that's that's another option right and

1180
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,840
then obviously increasing like the

1181
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">pastor politics god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should gotta throw</font>

1182
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,930
that in there right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

1183
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,060
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has that battle everybody's</font>

1184
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:46,370
still on that eight character default

1185
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:50,360
policy which enables us to password

1186
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:52,279
spray very easily so attackers I'm going

1187
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,440
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to highlight the</font>

1188
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,060
importance and value of credentials do

1189
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,640
this entire talk there's three main

1190
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,910
things from a credential perspective

1191
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,970
right we attempted to obtain credentials

1192
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:08,180
through password sprang through

1193
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:10,220
traditional reuse we then attempted to

1194
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,600
escalate<font color="#CCCCCC"> our privileges to get higher</font>

1195
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,700
level credentials let me try to sell the

1196
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,160
credentials at the end so Curtis was

1197
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,129
credentials are really worth a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1198
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,470
of you'll focus on on you know like let

1199
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">me get the latest like send solution or</font>

1200
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,700
let me get you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> some application</font>

1201
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,169
whitelisting solution but really your

1202
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,430
users are still using crappy passwords

1203
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,480
that's what we're going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1204
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,560
trying to pass word spray and find those

1205
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,130
users and pip it around using their

1206
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,680
password so attempt to locate credential

1207
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,090
reuse attempt the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprang stuff</font>

1208
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about which both these</font>

1209
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,520
things I actually wrote from blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

1210
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Black Hills blog if you want to go</font>

1211
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">check that out and then escalate</font>

1212
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,570
internally in crackle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of passwords so</font>

1213
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,190
with that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say have a great</font>
