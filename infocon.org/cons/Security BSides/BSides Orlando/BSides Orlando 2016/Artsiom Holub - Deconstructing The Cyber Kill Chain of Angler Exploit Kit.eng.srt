ah let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start I think I'm competing</font>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,870
with some virtualization steps that I

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,219
don't think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any more people will</font>

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,129
show up so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Artyom hope i</font>

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,560
would like to present the deconstruction

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cyber cool chain of the angler</font>

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,930
exploited kid campaign so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just</font>

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,029
clarify couple moments for myself how

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:31,920
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with exploit</font>

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:35,640
kids what about the angler<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay have you</font>

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,790
heard the cyber chain before awesome

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:45,230
alright so let's i'm currently a

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,789
security research analyst in opendns

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:52,349
we've got acquired by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco a couple</font>

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,829
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I keep from Belarus so</font>

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,300
English is not my foot & M's I sound

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,180
funny that's a gay I got my out studying

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,039
for a software engineer at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bull Russian</font>

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,740
at National Technical University of

20

Belarus when I had a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move here</font>

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,140
and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then I was a student of</font>

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,949
cyber security for about two years I've

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,509
been a freelance pentester mostly on the

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russian based social networks and banks</font>

29
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did some bug bounties for such a huge</font>

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,429
social networks like vk.com I which is

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,990
the biggest russian-speaking society

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,000
social network there and I got couple

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,780
bunches of them but unfortunately

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,630
couldn't be a contributing full time to

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,579
that so I got a job at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Open DNS where I</font>

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,818
do more of a pure analysis I don't can

37
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,299
to break stuff anymore but I like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

38
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:13,260
so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> start I will tell you where</font>

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,400
that

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,739
angular came from right then why am i

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,780
using the cyber toolchain years before

42
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:28,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">mostly in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> context of the apt which</font>

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,548

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:48,120
different the angle exploit kit targets

49
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:52,709
the specific regions of the IP spaces

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:57,470
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use their cyber</font>

51
00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:01,470
cool chain for it as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:05,099
exploited huge amount of money but most

53
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,470
of it come in bitcoins and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would give</font>

54
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,369
you some idea how those Bitcoin become

55
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:17,220
real cash for them just authors and then

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:20,280
some ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack how we do it opendns</font>

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,500
how system administrators are some

people who want to secure their network

59

when one of the russian analyst find

neutrino he will been doing a lot up

takedown of that blackhole exploit kit

83
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,340
campaign was taken down and after that

84
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:03,409
with more time to research he mapped it

85
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:06,530
to the triple x exploit kit that was

86
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:10,370
around since 2010 and that's what we

87
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,989
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the year of birth of the this</font>

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:17,600
exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit so why do i draw parallels</font>

89
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:22,700
and why is the signs of apt in that

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,520
thread so let's start its advanced not a

91
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">single exploit kit evolves as fast as</font>

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,789
angular as soon as new<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE comes out</font>

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,710
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already there they already</font>

94
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:40,180
exploiting it also the payload that

95
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,909
delivered by that exploit kit are almost

96
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,940
undetectable they are implementing honey

97
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,190
for detection so analysts don't even

98
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,820
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are there they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

99
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,310
catch it using their honey pots anti

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,490
virus detection doesn't work if you

101
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,540
heard about rent somewhere that's the

102
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:06,729
payload that's delivered by that and so

103
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:09,500
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't seen a single ng wires</font>

104
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,909
product that would detect it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:17,270
like ninety percent most of them about

106
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,130
57 if it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good ok also</font>

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:24,010
they're using techniques like domain

108
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:27,110
shadowing that was first used by this

109
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,240
the people behind this campaign and now

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,590
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other malicious authors also</font>

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,470
using it and all the payloads that

112
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,739
delivered by it either highly obfuscated

113
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:44,750
it or encrypted in one other way

114
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:49,910
so it stay persistent a lot of efforts

115
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,400
of security society is trying to stop it

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">from spreading so the big win was by</font>

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:02,239
tallest based at Cisco and it was just

118
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:09,860
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when they chipped</font>

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:13,639
down they toured excess 28 the wedding

120
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,819
about ninety percent of anger traffic

121
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,740
right so what the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it did</font>

122
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,319
all they do is change IP schema they

123
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,599
start targeting new people they probably

124
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,940
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tallest report so what they</font>

125
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,460
screwed up change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's still and</font>

126
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,490
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see for the last 90 days</font>

127
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,008
it increased from ten percent what it

128
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,289
stayed after the take down to fifty

129
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:40,370
percent what it used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just within</font>

130
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:43,219
at three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and it's a big</font>

131
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,539
threat they ravine you that it generated

132
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:52,849
is huge before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> poor did was getting</font>

133
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:58,159
about 90,000 victims a day sixty-two

134
00:07:52,849 --> 00:08:01,849
percent of those victims were delivered

135
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,800
with ransomware so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> either have to</font>

136
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:09,020
lose their data if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

137
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,710
data backups or they have to pay the

138
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,020
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it trying to make as much</font>

139
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,020
money as they can not just delivering

140
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,599
payloads they also use the existed

141
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,880
existing infrastructure to rent it to

142
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,389
other malicious authors and let them

reuse it for their own purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> Talis</font>

happens still in the apt you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

more steps that the cyber chain embedded

157
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:30,469
but I have to modify it because a lot of

158
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:33,019
profit dips in my case are happening

159
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,089

about the reconnaissance how it's

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,620
important for any malicious campaign and

169
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:07,370
in our case it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not different at all so</font>

170
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:10,040
for n kid they did basic infrastructure

171
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,470
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

172

who actually use either their fake

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:19,610
identities to put up servers that would

174
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:23,209
serve payloads and the initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign</font>

175
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,579
that they use to obtain register and

emails that later used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the domain</font>

they need they take it down almost

180
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,199
immediately so it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard like</font>

181
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,279
when the campaign is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:42,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">people already see it it's really hard</font>

183
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:47,060
to back-trace to the very beginning of

184
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,040
it they also use a lot of bulletproof

185

186

194
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,679
compromised websites so they don't

195
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,410
really aware that it's happening because

196
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,959
they just let<font color="#CCCCCC"> you host anything you want</font>

197
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,999
but all the security is up to you how

198
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,859
but you need it how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you want it</font>

199
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:39,399
what kind of server do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have how much</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you care about it so I won't become</font>

201
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,660

202
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:50,989
provider actually to take it down

203
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:52,670
without you noticing it also before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

204
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:54,379
actually compromise those servers they

205
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,540
have to somehow get the list of the

206
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:59,959
service to compromise so that means that

207
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,379
behind all these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> they run like at</font>

scanners all the time to get all the new

of some servers that doesn't have any

known vulnerabilities yet but they are

214
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:20,569
on like large providers or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ballot proof</font>

217

they might go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as the new cv</font>

218
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:33,139
come out and just exploit that most of

their delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic that was</font>

generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mel vertising said a huge</font>

222
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:47,179
companies that do online ads were

223
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,449
involved but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't their fault they</font>

use some say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old ad exchange or add</font>

225
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:56,359
hopping so they blindly trust some other

companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> run ads exchange the</font>

and another company doesn't have so they

230
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:11,660
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lurk it guys they would put</font>

231
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:15,289
up a fake ad agencies that look just

232
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,610
like real but if anybody would take it

233
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:21,189
serious and check it there would be more

234
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,630
of identities that either stolen or

235
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:28,420
don't exist at all so that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

236
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,180
reckon happened they put up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicated</font>

237
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,910
or bulletproof hosting servers that do

238
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,160
like fishing campaigns what they fishing

239
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it's not just regular credentials</font>

240
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,510
they are highly interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,689
accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are domain registered</font>

242
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,700
accounts in that case they don't need to

243
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,620
have the dedicated infrastructure that

244
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,269
are pretty valuable for them because

245
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really hard to put up the entire</font>

246
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,920
new infrastructure with like all new IPs

247
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,980
and move somewhere that they would

248
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,969
rather use some abuse providers or

249
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,940
bulletproof hosting to do that so what

250
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,810
we see that one of their essence is

251
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,930
actually still there and it's active and

252
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,880
it's just belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some guy from</font>

253
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,729
Ukraine and he registered to either a

254
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">fake identity or his own identity but</font>

255
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:23,410
because it's based in UK Oh Ukraine

256
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:26,439
there is like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to go for</font>

257
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,750
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> or people who actually infect it</font>

258
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,370
with that step and why is it helping

259
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,870
I'll check a little later so when the

260
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:40,750
infrastructure is ready they launched

261
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the so exploited and a prize domain at</font>

262
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,800
the quad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ridges are divided in the</font>

263
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:53,459
five more or less bigger categories so

264
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:57,130
those are domain shadowing which is up

265
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:59,410
when the legitimate website have a third

266
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,130
level domain that is registered to the

267
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:06,550
different IP that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that original domain</font>

268
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,860
then the WordPress<font color="#CCCCCC"> will know it's not</font>

269
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,609
because WordPress is bad just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's used so why'd they go for that</font>

271
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,529
that's implemented all almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere</font>

272
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,870
if it would be something else it would

273
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:23,140
have different name they would like that

274
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:28,480
part recently we see joomla coming up

275
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:31,970
and some others so<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CB that</font>

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:38,149
if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look on them most of them</font>

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:41,420
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java exploits one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

279
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,189
IE which is going away and for some

280
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,069
unknown reason because it was really a

281
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:49,189
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them I almost used for the</font>

282
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:51,709
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are older and who just have</font>

283
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:55,069
some in a well her parents they're just

284
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,959
using some some pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would</font>

285
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,610
never use you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them that do</font>

286
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,619
whatever they want and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

287
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,470
technical they don't need knowledgeable

288
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,930
and if they got hit with rent somewhere

289
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,329
it's a big threat for them because that

290
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,888
red screen saying that oh you lost all

291
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,750
your data you have to pay they would

292
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,779
rather pay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll tell anybody that</font>

293
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,410
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> screwed up see I was really good on</font>

294
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:21,290
there and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they shifting from it</font>

295
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:25,160
so the payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> did are delivered by the</font>

296
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:30,230
angler most of them ransomware about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51%</font>

297
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:34,040
was that Tesla crypt and explore their

298
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:38,360
payload by itself also evolves to you

299
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:42,740
like before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to H Tesla crypt when</font>

300
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:48,220
we analyze<font color="#E5E5E5"> the co-occurrences with what</font>

301
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:50,750
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> what go to the website they'll</font>

302
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,730
during the Lord of the initial page

303
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,699
everything that's on that page will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

304
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,819
load it such as add a mother stabbed

305
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:02,300
that have that resides on different IPS

306
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:05,240
in the actual page and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Tesla</font>

307
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:09,559
crypt the first thing what it will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

308
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:15,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">will send a unique identifier including</font>

the encrypting key to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> common server</font>

310
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:22,459
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would call the it</font>

311
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:25,400
would make the IP call and analyzing the

312
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,439
occurrences and those IP calls we will

313
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,020
chip in the domains that we're

314
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,919
delivering the Tesla crib but now they

315
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,408
remove that IP initial IP call and we

316
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,470
didn't have chance to find any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way</font>

317
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:42,049
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see if it's just like ripped</font>

318
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,920
or anything else kind of looking harder

319
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:48,290
to break it down to the categories but

320
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,030
the next big one is a creep to wall it's

321
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:54,080
also started with just the crypto<font color="#E5E5E5"> walled</font>

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and crypto all 3.0 now it's 4.0 changing</font>

323
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,649
consistently implementing new techniques

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:05,060
be deep flat track in timber which are

the credential student<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans and</font>

326
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,960
timber is the banking one they use it

327
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,460
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a lot less traffic on</font>

328
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,530
them then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> rent somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

329
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,900
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the ransomware is the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the lender is all usually look so first</font>

333
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:32,530
of all they use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see as</font>

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:36,320
a pseudo dark leach which is a not a

whoever take care of your website didn't

341

go every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day to that actual PHP</font>

scroll<font color="#CCCCCC"> down all the way to see that</font>

343
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:04,160
highly obfuscated it PHP injections

344
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,490
there is no way for you to actually see

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you try to view source code</font>

346
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,310
as a regular user it wouldn't be shown

347
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:17,090
to you so second one and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

348
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:20,360
that been using for last year dns

349
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,760
shadowing so I frame URL it used to be

350
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,590
there now I pming<font color="#E5E5E5"> host names that how we</font>

351
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,690
used to catch it we see the call to the

352
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,750
no IP and we will like block it right

353
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,120
away has been replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the third</font>

354
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,430
level domain names of sites with egg<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

355
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,169
accounts a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are godaddy but</font>

356
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,150
there are a lot of others abuse

357
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:42,380
providers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

358
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:46,670
later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually at those links for</font>

359
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,760
about two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours right they did</font>

360
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,310
it because they don't want everybody

361
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,650
block everything like if we put them all

362
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,960
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> once yeah they will generate some</font>

363
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,910
amount of money that but then all these

364
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,309
websites will be in all block<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists and</font>

365
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,009
no but

366
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:05,490
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload anymore so they</font>

367
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:09,029
usually shifting it from one domain to

368
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:12,570
another and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually do about 3-4</font>

369
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:14,100
days before they change the schema one

370
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,809
of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we start seeing is</font>

371
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,389
the form like<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs the iframe URL now</font>

372
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:23,039
resemble URL of the forum site so they

373
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:25,649
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that but then at the very end</font>

374
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,289
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a long alpha skated</font>

375
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:30,600
string but for the antivirus solutions

376
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,669
or some kind of web filters it just

377
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:38,899
looked like the regular forum page and

378
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:41,820
they don't block it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you draw the</font>

379
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:45,209
sequences that how that action happens

380
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:48,360
we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first the victim visit</font>

381
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,029
some well-known trusted site like Daily

382
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,119
Mail was compromised with anger

383
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:57,559
exploited skype was delivering mail

384
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,939
vertising with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> anger exploit kit and</font>

385
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,490
those stuff you don't block IP

386
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,990
reputation is high they are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex at</font>

387
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,509
top thousand or something like that

388
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,679
contain not blocked everybody tries<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

389
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:14,789
and they use the Google shortener URL

390
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:17,759
from the advertising to redirect people

391
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,980
to next pages where they will redirect

392
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:25,879
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> or redirect again to hit the</font>

393
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,879
payload right so when the a primal a

394
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:36,200
redirection take place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all their ssl</font>

395
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:39,269
that URL is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted right and</font>

396
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,269
they we've seen like recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use</font>

397
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:44,070
gif images which is like really really

398
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,769
rare<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we'll see if it there will be a</font>

399
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,869
new trend with<font color="#CCCCCC"> there on the fly encoding</font>

400
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:52,679
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not suggesting that these</font>

401
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">things is reside that PHP code look for</font>

402
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,440
it get it from what helped you Abby and

403
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:03,450
it gets right there will be encrypted

404
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:06,539
stream right also not everybody will get

405
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:10,980
exploit not everybody will I get payload

406
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:12,809
they target a specific IP areas so most

407
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,120
of them is Europe

408
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,769
United States because the people here

409
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,168
can pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for an somewhere and they</font>

410
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:24,480
there is no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them to target</font>

411
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:28,110
some like<font color="#E5E5E5"> purple countries or countries</font>

412
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,179
that there are doing the business in

413
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,449
just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can get kicked out</font>

414
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:37,320
pretty fast if they do that they're

415
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:40,200
right so again the IP reputation fails

416
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,120
the main looks legit and then then the

417
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:50,610
next redirect to the shadow copy of that

418
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:52,279
domain sorry next<font color="#E5E5E5"> redirect you the</font>

419
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,539
shadow copy of the domain which is a

420
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,610
theology looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-level domain but</font>

421
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,100
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third level domain that</font>

422
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,949
resides on the different IP from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,189
original domain and here usually no

424
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:08,960
checks then the first flash file

425
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,480
delivered and executed what it does it

426
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,019
penetrated this system checks if it's a

427
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,429
honeypot checks if the certain

428
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:20,090
antiviruses i installed on that and

429
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:24,080
based on that it makes a decision either

430
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,240
stop the practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point or</font>

431
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,749
deliver it a specific payload that are

432
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,600
not that wouldn't be seen but that

433
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:36,590
antivirus or whatever their specific

434
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,219
software installed on that system and

435
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:44,009
only if also it will check for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like</font>

436
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,110
they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can exploit so if is</font>

437
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:48,269
everything up to date they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

438
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,129
bother delivering your payload because

439
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:51,899
you will get the notification of your

440
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,908
antivirus that you've been attack and

441
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,459
that might trigger some flags for like

442
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:59,129
your security team or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

443
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they just stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that at</font>

444
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:02,730
this point and you didn't notice if you

445
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,639
don't have anything exploitable you

446
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:08,730
don't get payload but if you have only

447
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:10,740
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit the lender page and when</font>

448
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the lender page web filter is</font>

449
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,539
failed web address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not blog it's like</font>

450
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,169
unknown it<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives only for two hours or</font>

451
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:21,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it's it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard make it or</font>

452
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:24,990
update your block list like that fast

453
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,620
like on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hourly basis and then the</font>

454
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,690
payload delivered

455
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:34,719
just because the ransomware is kind of

456
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:37,240
malicious code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like a legit</font>

457
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,000
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at it it just</font>

458
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypts data how many of your software</font>

459
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,710
it creeps data a lot so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a no</font>

460
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,230
way to make like a strict rules against

461
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,930
that to catch it on the fly say I know

462
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,360
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anwar is failed again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

463
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,600
the vitiation decryption again web

464
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,080
filter failed communication is not blog

465
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,909
encrypted data then all the local

466
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,350
repositories of their backups that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

467
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:12,690
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be removed as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

468
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:15,699
then the ransom notes would display so

469
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:19,210
because it's so efficient it generates a

470
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,670
lot of money value about sixty percent

471
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,030
of people are ready to pay rent

472
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:27,240
somewhere and add recently you might

473
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,370
hurt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they start targeting like</font>

474
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,679
hospitals and schools and that way you

475
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,540
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wait if you have a</font>

476
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,730
situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need the data right</font>

477
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:41,350
now no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they ask</font>

478
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:44,350
you will have to pay so as it was ported

479
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:47,860
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> tall esteem the estimated revenue was</font>

480
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:50,409
about 35 million dollars a year but then

481
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:56,469
ninety percent of those asn were taken

482
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:59,140
down and within 90 days have like it

483
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,360
gets up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fifty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is</font>

484
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,150
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so it just cuts down to about</font>

485
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,500
17 million it's still huge amount of

486
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:11,770
money but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is those money are</font>

487
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,970
not actual cash those money are bitcoins

488
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:21,070
and to legalize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that huge amount of</font>

489
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:25,960
bitcoins it's pretty challenging we are

490
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,970
doing a deep dive into the dark part of

491
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,170
the web to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the schemas that</font>

492
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:36,810
they use to actually get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real cash</font>

493
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:40,540
out of the bitcoins so far we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

494
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:44,679
main ways that those money become<font color="#E5E5E5"> League</font>

495
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,350
I still the ways that were used at ten

496
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:51,730
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Max vision right it's</font>

497
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:54,340
carding way you buy stolen credit cards

498
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:57,100
with some amount of money and that would

499
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,850
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal for</font>

500
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:03,550
the bitcoins oh she do that like right

501
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,560
away but usually for the credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card</font>

502
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have from three to five thousand</font>

503
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,760
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's for about twelve to</font>

504
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,689
fifteen thousand dollars in bitcoins oh

505
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,090
you lose 70 priyamani the way you know

506
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,160
it's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> great even like from 17</font>

507
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,709
million go down to like three four

508
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:28,740
million that's a big loss so they're

509
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:31,600
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a now with the race of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Alibaba</font>

510
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,180
Chinese company they shifting it there

511
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,820
because ebay have improved a lot of

512
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:40,510
security based in<font color="#E5E5E5"> states</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that they</font>

513
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,060
don't yet do that but so let's see will

514
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,580
it take for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice this stop</font>

515
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:52,060
going they're so underground exchange is

516
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:54,429
pretty one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registrant emails that</font>

517
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,919
owned by the authors of exploit kid

518
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:00,250
actually used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> host a website that</font>

519
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,590
would let you buy bitcoins and pay your

520
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,750
real money but it was taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> down not</font>

521
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,939
that long ago and i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it was</font>

522
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual person behind it or was</font>

523
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,930
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so the end result anyway</font>

524
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,899
oh and of course modules those taking

525
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,360
about ten twenty percent of the money it

526
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,760
looks great for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malicious authors</font>

527
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:27,399
but not that many people are ready to be

528
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:31,480
meals so the end result is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty</font>

529
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,400
plus percent of the of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss so out</font>

530
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,680
of 17 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good if they got</font>

531
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">about seven eight million dollars at the</font>

532
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,330
very end and this is during a year it

533
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,400
might change because we consistently

534
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,379
fighting them taken down their

535
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:52,060
infrastructure and everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

536
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:54,340
also detection prevention since i work

537
00:28:52,060 --> 00:29:01,658
at opendns i will be focused on

538
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:04,418
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I shall we use our software that</font>

539
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:06,640
we bill it's called investigate and it

540
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,309
absorbed a lot of feeds from like

541
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,380
different third vendors and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

own algorithms that our researchers come

up with so one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SP rank</font>

544
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:20,320
which stands for that spike rank if you

about 100 billion queries and a day so

550
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,610
we can apply our intelligence to that

551
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:44,919
huge amount of money of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

the specific window and flag it as

suspicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> right away so how it looks</font>

556
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:01,330
like usually let's say your website have

557
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:04,000
about hundred carries an hour for 10 20

558
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,970
days and then at some point it jumps up

559
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like 1200 an hour that's not normal</font>

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,520
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> either you are becoming really</font>

00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:14,469
popular or something malicious going on

562
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">right another one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the honeypot used</font>

563
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:22,210
to be really a good source of all that

564
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:24,219
HTTP embedded payload data and

565
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,590
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they start</font>

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:30,480
implementing avoiding techniques it

567
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:33,129
dropped a lot we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see about</font>

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,100
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty four hundred domains at</font>

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised domains and lender</font>

570
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,510
pages a day using those honey pots now

571
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:47,439
we dropped you about 80 maybe hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

572
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:50,470
sell but then private around those

573
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,450
domains to let us discovered compromised

574
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:59,049
and and IPS and a sense that are

575
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,690
dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid proof and we can make</font>

just abused hosting

579
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:18,070
we also can see the app patterns that

580
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:20,510
they use like<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJs or something else to</font>

581
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:28,370
DJ is really great because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font>

the seed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can like you can use that</font>

583
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:35,030
seed and might like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can predict what</font>

584
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:38,930
are those domains would look in the

585
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:41,570
future and block them ahead of time but

586
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:44,570
unfortunately they stopped using<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJs and</font>

587
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:47,990
most DJ's I used by the botnets right

588
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,520
now and the exploit kit authors staying

589
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:57,220
away from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so that</font>

590
00:31:51,520 --> 00:32:02,720
everything in my date we had that a

591
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,690
domain right here right which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is have no</font>

592
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,820
traffic up until the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixth of March and</font>

593
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,210
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly it got like four hot plus</font>

594
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:15,310
tourism so that's not normal when we

595
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,620
take a deeper look in it we see that it

596
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:23,360
registered by that guy obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

597
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:25,399
Russian email and for like non Russian

598
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,010
speakers hard to tell actually there are

599
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:35,510
two real words which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain and break</font>

600
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:37,250
right also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we check how any other</font>

601
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,560
domains that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered with the</font>

602
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,530
same account we can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look</font>

603
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,260
almost the same right it used the first

604
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,110
word which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> goloka is ahead and it</font>

605
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:54,500
used the animals so they started with

606
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:58,100
the crocodile else cell dot patterns can

607
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,080
use in their ex and like from that part

608
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,969
we start seeing that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guys</font>

609
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,139
behind that probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russians if they</font>

610
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,450
using that stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

611
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,310
authoritive servers that they use they

612
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:16,700
are up highly abused they are about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font>

613
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to 15 hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised domains than</font>

614
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,179
them

615
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:26,240
if we ply wood down there and see what

616
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:28,640
are the other domains that are using

617
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this outer jib</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thurber's for their</font>

618
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,309
purpose way again we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

619
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:38,360
patterns and those are Russian words are

620
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:42,379
written in translate and they using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

621
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:45,918
noun + + adverb which is color so and

622
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:48,710
they use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot so it would be like</font>

623
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,539
green face if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you translate that from</font>

624
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,950
Russian and when we start checking those

625
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:57,250
domains or we can see they are

626
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">registered by the different author and</font>

627
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:05,750
this guy I owned a company which called

628
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:10,668
add media which is a fake advertising

629
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:15,560
and it was delivering all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic to</font>

630
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:18,560
the anger landing pages for last half a

631
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,480
year and all those accounts is still

632
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:28,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">alive the registering and new domains</font>

633
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:31,750
almost every day on that and where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

634
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:36,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">are lender page is actually reside and</font>

635
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,690
further you will see whether and those

636
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,969
people are don't even hiding they just

637
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,200
using like what looks like a real at

638
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:48,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">least stolen identity to chew on that so</font>

639
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:52,399
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that came from</font>

640
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:54,409
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the honeypot so from for me like</font>

641
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,348
I already did like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time but</font>

642
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:00,280
that looks like a domain shadowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

643
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">away I'd have some legitimate looking</font>

644
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,150
sec a second-level domain top-level

645
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,550
domain right here and then right right

646
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">here it just it looks like a real word</font>

647
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,470
by they would add like couple extra

648
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,720
letters that it kind of real word and

649
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,299
not the real world at the same time so

650
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,549
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the actual</font>

651
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,570
second-level domain it resides on that

652
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,640
IP but if we take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that third</font>

653
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,240
level domain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I don way different</font>

654
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,680
IP which started with 31 right so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

655
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,660
check who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that domain we</font>

656
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,410
and see the registrant email we can

657
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:39,118
check how many other domains he owns and

658
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,879
if we check them there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

659
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,309
malicious there but now we know that

660
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,829
malicious author already own that

661
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:50,369
registrant email and adjust the matter

662
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:55,230
of time when those domains would be

663
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:57,420
compromised we can I suspicious and just

664
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,819
wait until like the first spike of

665
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:04,490
traffic to block it or we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just block</font>

666
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:08,730
them proactively but in cases it's a

667
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,040
downward it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this register</font>

668
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,740
and emails they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually aware that</font>

669
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,079
they they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised and then they</font>

670
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,160
would like call and scream oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god why</font>

671
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,109
are you blocking us we are not doing

672
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,970
anything bad yes you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing</font>

673
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything bad but the security on your</font>

674
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:26,220
DNS records was stolen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then like how</font>

675
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,259
we can fix it although change it or we

676
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:32,098
can change the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so what</font>

677
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,760
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right and if we take a look</font>

678
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,730
again of the space where all those

679
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:44,099
domain shadow resides we can see that's

680
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:47,640
mostly Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you got a seed</font>

681
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,740
using opendns investigate you can

682
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">leverage down or you can use the feed</font>

683
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,020
air from anywhere it's either honeypot

684
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,520
virustotal malware thread grid but you

685
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,839
gotta see it and that private<font color="#E5E5E5"> hangar</font>

686
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">outdid seed you can find out patterns</font>

687
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,828
infrastructures and other useful

688
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,619
information that can find out what those

689
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:11,280
malicious author so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abused</font>

690
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,980
networks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see they are it's this</font>

691
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,740
is the mix of dedicated and compromised

692
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,780
but you see on the very top there are

693
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,118
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russians and this one is Ukrainian</font>

694
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,010
that one that we've seen was used in the

695
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
very beginning for advertising the

696
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">boggin addresses that were using the</font>

697
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,910
fishing campaigns and you can see they

698
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:37,740
using some bodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> a credentials that</font>

699
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:40,799
look legit we will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify this</font>

700
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,930
guy but that's what what's ongoing right

701
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:45,050
now and we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those</font>

702
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:50,870
people behind that part

703
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:53,780
but yeah most abuse providers the in

704
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Foley global corporation but they bought</font>

705
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:00,350
their part from godaddy then it said JP

706
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:04,640
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll show it's located and</font>

707
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:10,460
one asn in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

709
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:17,810
last 90 days so i was told that life

710
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,990
demo is not work doesn't work usually

711
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:26,360
but let me give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a try so i'm using</font>

712
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:30,859
open graph which is our open source

713
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:34,130
project to visualize any data sets that

714
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:36,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it's a I think it's open</font>

715
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,660
graffiti calm you can check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

716
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,890
do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own stuff but I will do it for</font>

717
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,009
the IPS that were seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the angler</font>

718
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:56,240
campaign and we identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most active</font>

719
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:58,040
part of them let's do put<font color="#E5E5E5"> green so I'm</font>

720
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:05,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to load the data set that I</font>

721
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:09,710
extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> there from our system and those</font>

722
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:13,910
are compromised and dedicated right so

723
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:17,960
let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow a little bigger alright so</font>

724
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:20,120
the rap connected nodes and unconnected

725
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,180
nodes connected nodes are those that

726
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,990
were seen in DNS queries for the last

727
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:29,540
night is those who are don't have any

728
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:32,149
connections they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so let's</font>

729
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,960
just explore trade those so it wouldn't

730
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,960
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that noisy</font>

731
00:39:44,450 --> 00:40:16,830
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's select I was I guess that</font>

732
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:24,870
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a true that life doesn't really work</font>

733
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:27,420
that type I would be so it's open source

734
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,730
project so it's always evolving and the

735
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,060
trip they made any changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API</font>

736
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,630
sounds like that oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright be just</font>

737
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,630
me trippin

738
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:56,060
so now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose only the one that have</font>

739
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">connections</font>

740
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:07,720
and then remove them<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah now it</font>

741
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:17,190
works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then let's just add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some color</font>

742
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:17,189
in it to do color blue

743
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:36,710
Oh yourself now we can get AB so now we

744
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:42,770
can see all the a sense that have a lot

745
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:49,540
of compromised IPS on them and some of

746
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:52,880
the and some of them are not that I

747
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">abused not that bad but they still abuse</font>

748
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:02,240
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part where the signal is</font>

749
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">going it text how big is a traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

750
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,890
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> note so the faster it goes the more</font>

751
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:10,430
queries an hour they have the lower it

752
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:12,200
goes the less queries an hour it is so

753
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,870
this is the graphical representation of

754
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,060
all day a sense that were highly active

755
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:23,000
in the last 90 days and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font>

756
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:25,430
IPS if we add domains on the IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

757
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,430
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more notes it at this</font>

758
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:31,490
point it's about half a million notes

759
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:36,560
that are actually either abused

760
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:42,500
compromised or dedicated lender pages if

761
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:45,710
so let's go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tation right so how</font>

762
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,650
to mitigate the risk keep backups of the

763
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:52,010
data all the time at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Primus payload</font>

764
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:54,320
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ransomware you want to have it I</font>

765
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,600
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> three backups at least because I</font>

766
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,600
really care about my data I don't care

767
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,029
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that huge amount of pictures</font>

768
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:07,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my wife has something else so I don't</font>

769
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:07,060
back up your data but my eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mask</font>

770
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:14,480
we have to use a layered security system

771
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,580
firewall is the must what we see now

772
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,910
even so we can detect it at different

773
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:23,240
levels if you have a layered security<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

774
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot harder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can stop the</font>

775
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,410
exploitation chain in just one spot to

00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:32,720
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it stop so to break one</font>

777
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,348
link and that's it that's all you need

778
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,479
so

779
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:40,249
the layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security will help you to</font>

780
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:45,558
do that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the companies as it</font>

781
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:47,988
was discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Cisco about sixty</font>

percent of the enterprise's don't have

any DNS control and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

784
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:55,789
important implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS control let</font>

785
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:58,879
us stop about almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seventy</font>

786
00:43:55,789 --> 00:44:01,910
percent more ransomware than we used to

787
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,609
stop without DNS control patch

788
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:08,899
management as you can see from the

791
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,089
dated like three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago but there's</font>

792
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:19,069
still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of software a lot of</font>

794
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:24,319
versions and it looks like they either

795
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:26,538
don't care or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the right</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them to mitigate those risks right and</font>

798
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:37,099
then as we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fifty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font>

799
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:42,829
all the lender pages domain shadowing

00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:46,539
shall implement the as strict policy for

801
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:48,769
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS records and DNS seconds is very</font>

802
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:50,569
important and you have to have a

803
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:53,089
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that would check if</font>

804
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,829
there anything happened if you have if

805
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:56,749
there is like another IP added that

806
00:44:54,829 --> 00:45:00,729
point to your domain or something like

807
00:44:56,749 --> 00:45:03,738
that most of the domain shadows live for

808
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:07,839
months and months before anybody will

809
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:10,789
notice and even when we notify when it

810
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,190
like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example it's front tire net</font>

811
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:17,390
company they have a domain shadow on

812
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:19,849
their main IP for last four weeks right

813
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:22,400
now they still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't follow up to us</font>

814
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,289
that threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still there anybody can</font>

815
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,339
access it and it leaves on the server

816
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:31,819
where they have all their users login

817
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:35,058
page so if that web server is

818

education unfortunately it's really hard

821
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,240
for like in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate user</font>

822
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,740
for I because you say that

823
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,649
like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use internet because</font>

00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:55,100
that memorizing can be anywhere as long

825
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:57,560
as ad companies would try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for big</font>

money and would blindly trust like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ed</font>

829
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,190
the reasons why angular keeps winning

00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:13,130
right one is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious the</font>

would target like post you suck

cream when you that would still in cards

858
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,980
would outsource that part where they

859
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:38,510
have to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess most of the banks when</font>

860
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,600
you have a huge transaction they would

861
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:45,020
call the owner so they will catch that

862
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,270
call rerouted to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> skype and make you</font>

that schema so there is though that

there is the reason why it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:06,990
up it completely so our findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

using various threads to infect user for

872
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,480
crime organization that is huge there

are a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they either</font>

trade their stuff to each other or they

have strong connections between them

each<font color="#CCCCCC"> other two and hopefully if we play</font>

878
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:37,920
on there there might be a way for one of

them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get some useful</font>

infrastructure being compromised it's a

884
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,830
significant threat right now when they

885
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,000
implement honey pot and anti virus

886
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:58,680
detection techniques I'd go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

seventy-five percent unfortunately I

didn't have the data available for that

889
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,270
of analysis shall I stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the one</font>

that tells did five months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our</font>

security applications do not quickly

security researchers and analysts come

899
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:44,580
up with some solutions to stop that

900
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:49,410
because the ransomware incidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not</font>

find the how the hackers got in and to

00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,170
find out the way to mitigate this risk

companies

909
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:19,230
and even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have forensic people</font>

910
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:22,740
coming to their machine as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">before they used a worthless technique</font>

912
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:28,020
which means they don't have anything

volatile part of the ramp for analysis

918
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:46,618
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it right after</font>

it it's already gone and i think that's
