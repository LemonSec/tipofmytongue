6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,279
stuff really entry-level stuff but at

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,670
the same time that's kind of the point

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,740
right my goal is to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that this</font>

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,550
stuff is really ridiculously easy

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,080
especially when people make it easy so

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,040
to begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,660
that anything in this talk that looks

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,399
even remotely legal totally didn't

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,349
happen it's all one hundred percent

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,719
fictional this was all a lab environment

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,489
and the any resemblance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,390
persons is only because I am really

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically I'm not career than anything</font>

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,640
that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stress many times</font>

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,009
across this talk is that operational

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,079
security failures make an investigator's

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,460
job really easy I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sit</font>

52
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,280
fence you fall on there will be

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,628
something relevant to you right so if

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,180
you're more interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in blue teaming</font>

55
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,920
or incident response or you know monitor

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,680
as a

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,059
as a analyst there will be interesting

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,739
points for you if you're more interested

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the offensive something malware</font>

whatever you'll hopefully glean

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,260
something out of this talk as well so

63
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,580
you're probably wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> who the hell</font>

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,370
is this guy that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing up at the</font>

71
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,140
research we do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of red teaming</font>

72
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:51,109
stuff we also have managed security

73
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,319
services so essentially sock monitoring

74
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:58,430
as a service I'm not a Salesman but go

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,548
look them up because we're amazing I'm a

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,040
computer security club so anyway headers

80
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,540
in the room blue oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's cool</font>

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,760
ultimately I have a passion for

82
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,700
literally anything related to security

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,769
right yet how lock works<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how to</font>

84
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,750
penetrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> air-gap networks everything</font>

85
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,650
about security fascinates me and I hope

86
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see this throughout the talk</font>

87
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,100
so to begin with we're going to start

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this background scenario of what</font>

89
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,560
happened right and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

90
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a little discussion on ransomware</font>

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,739
so raise your hand if everyone here

92
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,220
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what ransomware as we all know it</font>

93
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,209
I figured so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

94
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,070
read you the definition I'm sure you

95
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,030
already know malicious file encrypt

96
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,670
everything on the hard drive and says

97
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,829
hey you give me money awesome now

98
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,208
there's a few typical infection vectors

99
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,100
but some of the most common ones are

100
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,560
through email and malicious

101
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,440
advertisements just so we're clear I

102
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,250
want to show you how bad these attacks

103
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,730
are and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad i mean bad badly</font>

104
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,590
attempted right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally what a</font>

105
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,530
legitimate ransomware attack looks like

106
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,900
it's sent to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a random blast of multiple</font>

107
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,608
people there is literally nothing in the

108
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,200
message body and there is an attachment

109
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:25,130
called part 1 zip that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

110
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,659
suspicious at all right now so we open

111
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,030
the zip file and

112
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,610
we come across another file that says

113
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,030
part 1 j s it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript file and</font>

114
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,550
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's heavily obstacle now</font>

115
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,229
we could spend hours and hours trying to

116
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,510
reverse-engineer it and get get it all

117
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,010
back to plain text does anyone have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

118
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,289
ideas on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what that process</font>

119
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,200
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be how you go about doing it it</font>

120
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,060
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't really care my</font>

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,409
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce you the</font>

122
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,980
wonderful world of google that's it

123
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,680
seriously that's it the first result is

124
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,380
a utility that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love to use called jst</font>

125
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,320
talks and essentially it's a malware

126
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,240
analysis tool that uses static analysis

127
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the application techniques and execution</font>

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,880
featuring HTML Dom emulation to put it

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,060
in English<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stupid simple stupid</font>

130
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,700
easy to use and it reverses hasta que

131
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,920
todavia script samples literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

132
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,320
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 minutes to set it up and</font>

133
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,450
you will analyze any malicious piece of

134
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,760
JavaScript in less than 30 seconds I

135
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,610
know it says five minutes but let's be

136
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,250
honest 30 seconds it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> like magic</font>

137
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,240
right what you do is you take the

138
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">obstacle code use the laser pointer here</font>

139
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,460
paste it in the top and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hit that</font>

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,500
magic hole analyze button and then at

141
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,049
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom it prints plain text and</font>

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,640
human readable code really really really

143
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,080
difficult stuff to do we can all<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font>

144
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,909
that right so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look</font>

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,700
well let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a closer look at what</font>

146
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,180
the at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs that are contained</font>

147
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,039
within this javascript file so looking

148
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it what could what do we notice about</font>

149
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,460
these URLs what can anyone just throw

150
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,130
out some ideas what do you see that

151
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,989
special about them wordpress that's

152
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,540
right and what do we lie why do we love

153
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">WordPress because because WordPress</font>

154
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:24,940
sucks and it's so easy exploit anything

155
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:27,409
else that we notice what do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> link to</font>

156
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,590
executable and are they the same

157
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,890
executable right on so they all link to

158
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:37,400
the executable and they all and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

159
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,840
them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress so we'll keep that</font>

160
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,520
in the back of our heads but

161
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,068
realistically at this point we

162
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,740
to a fork in the road right do we focus

163
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,259
on the executables or do we focus on the

164
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,629
websites and ultimately it kind of

165
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,590
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your goal right if I'm a blue</font>

166
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,520
team and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company hires us to do this</font>

167
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,719
generally all they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really looking for</font>

168
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we generate indicate as a</font>

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,159
compromise right I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

170
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,620
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can look for to determine</font>

171
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,270
when a machine gets hit that way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

172
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">just set it up to automatically block it</font>

173
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,840
if I was an investigator ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

174
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,759
goal would probably be to determine

175
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,008
attribution I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arrest the guy</font>

176
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,860
who's running this ransomware operation

177
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,690
or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're bit of an asshole and we</font>

178
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,860
all have that inside of us we could go

179
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">there out with trolling the troll</font>

180
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,039
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fun let's be honest</font>

181
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,970
so that being said we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

182
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,969
look a quick lesson in our analysis

183
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,860
reversing is hard I think we can't agree

184
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:37,009
that I don't know assembly I'm learning

185
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,539
it I hate it it sucks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately i'm</font>

186
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,379
lazy Packers were lazy we can all agree

187
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,969
being lazy is awesome now the great part

188
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,759
about this is that there's tools that

189
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:48,590
make all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this super easy one of my</font>

190
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,750
personal favorites is<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuckoo sandbox</font>

191
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,669
right if you've ever used malware calm

192
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,229
it's the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same framework I prefer</font>

193
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,000
to stand up my own instance because it

194
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:58,520
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to do configurations that</font>

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,860
aren't possible on malware I can use my

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,810
own plugins I can pull a lot more info

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,699
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it than i can with malware calm</font>

198
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,569
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't have to share my sample</font>

199
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,599
with anyone so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coo coo you</font>

200
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,940
can go there download it visit it later

201
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,069
Mauer analysis system just upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

202
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,810
file it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a sandbox and</font>

203
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,840
then generate indicators and you know

204
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:25,699
what the best part about cuckoo is it's

205
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,739
free so you upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sample hit run</font>

206
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,889
and it generates indicators in about 120

207
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,120
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I don't know if you could</font>

208
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it out there but here you'll</font>

209
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,399
see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URLs let's talk to and then</font>

210
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:42,380
any HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications is all nice and</font>

211
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:44,240
readable in plain text so we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

212
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,209
closer look at one of these at one of

213
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,949
the HTTP communications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it made to</font>

214
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:53,449
so there's a website / misc dot PHP ?

215
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the parameter is essentially</font>

216
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a encrypt</font>

217
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,310
he that it uploads to the website

218
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,660
there's multiple websites so there was

219
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,479
some redundancy built into the sample

220
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,579
just to make sure that hey even if one

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,240
of the websites went down we can still

222
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,878
get our ransomware out that being<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,370
what else did we find running the sample

224
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,509
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuckoo obviously didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crypts</font>

225
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,850
all the files on your hard drive there's

226
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:20,060
no surprise there transom where it

227
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,360
points you to a dot onion server which

228
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,529
is located on tour so what we can see

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,870
and visit the decryption server

230
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,269
ultimately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no idea where it's at</font>

231
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,389
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not the NSA and I'm not the</font>

232
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">FBI and I'm not at Carnegie Mellon so I</font>

233
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,639
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way of decrypting the</font>

234
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,329
actual location of this tour server and

235
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:44,329
at all each sample always does one thing

236
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:48,019
first which is checks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users external</font>

237
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:51,019
IP address using the same site and they

238
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:53,810
all reach out to something PHP on all of

239
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,180
the dropper sites so since we know that

240
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the samples reach out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

241
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,689
external IP check and that's the first

242
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,490
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do we can pretty much</font>

243
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,430
generate an indicator of compromise that

244
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,529
says if anything on your network visits

245
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,930
this page you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably block it</font>

246
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:12,709
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lose all your files fair</font>

247
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,660
enough but now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to the</font>

248
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,209
fun part right the boring malware

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,009
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts over we did the really</font>

250
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:20,560
lazy mode binary analysis because again

251
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,420
real lazy and were constricted on time

252
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,279
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking at the actual</font>

253
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,099
infrastructure behind all all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operations now since we already know</font>

255
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the drivers use WordPress</font>

256
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,160
something we could do is break out WP

257
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,980
skin if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used WP scan before</font>

258
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,100
it's really retarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee easy to use dot</font>

vulnerable themes for that wordpress

264

website and it'll even link you to the

here than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I could literally</font>

shells a personal favorite is and I

290
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,210
already forgot how to say the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

291
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">374 k WS oh I see this one pretty common</font>

292
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,760
it's all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet widely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

293
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,790
but if you're using Kelly there's plenty

294
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,080
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> user shell web shells here's</font>

295
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,980
pretty much what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like now that</font>

296
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,770
we've uploaded it on our website great

297
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,740
so we know all of the droppers reach out

298
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,840
to a specific page to talk to the

299
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,550
decryption server so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font>

300
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,920
go ahead and take a closer look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

301
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,810
page I don't know if you can see this

302
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,329
here but there's a variable that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

303
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,430
dollar sign you are equals I know I

304
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,890
understand that I blacked it out but

305
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:39,930
that says dot-com at the end dot-com

306
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">when originally the decryption server</font>

307
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,920
was thought onion it really shouldn't be

308
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,310
this easy it's completely useless if you

309
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,640
link to the actual URL instead of

310
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:57,229
linking to like a tour gateway now I

311
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,230
know where your servers that awesome

312
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,860
poking around the web sites did we

313
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,750
notice anything else aside from all

314
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,640
having that same gateway dropper

315
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,310
whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call it they all</font>

316
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,520
have a folder<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says / cash and then</font>

317
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,270
some random string of characters looking

318
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,890
closer

319
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,260
you could kind of tell that it's got

320
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,370
something to do with span it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

321
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,189
a hundred percent sure what it is yet

322
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:25,040
right but we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead</font>

323
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look only to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

324
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,010
looking through the code we notice they

325
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:34,500
obstacle the location of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea to</font>

326
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:36,300
server using what str rot13 that is

327
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,440
unbreakable encryption if you use that

328
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:45,120
the NSA will cry it's uber<font color="#E5E5E5"> late so for</font>

329
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,090
Leslie they don't know rot13 it's a very

330
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,940
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> character substitution I'm sure</font>

331
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,070
you can figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there's no way</font>

332
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,640
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this server at all</font>

333
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,640
at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just going to go ahead</font>

334
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and visit the server and then oh crap</font>

335
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,110
we're blocked by a login screen now at

336
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I still have no idea what's</font>

337
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,860
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind this login screen</font>

338
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,540
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and hours and</font>

339
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,180
hours looking for vulnerability on the

340
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,939
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> just crunching time away on verb</font>

341
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,339
or doing whatever but again I'm lazy so

342
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,280
we could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop out hydro and brute</font>

343
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,990
force the password now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do both</font>

344
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,339
of these at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time right run</font>

345
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">hydro in the background and then start</font>

346
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:30,030
looking for vulnerabilities the great

347
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about Hydra is that</font>

348
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,860
the weakest link in security is the

349
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,260
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> element in humans are well face it</font>

350
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,090
everyone's a little bit stupid so when

351
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,660
your password is literally one two one

352
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:46,200
two one two it takes 30 seconds to get

353
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">into this you should probably use the</font>

354
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,240
better password probably so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get in</font>

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,960
and this is what the panel looks like

356
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,240
anyone here read Russian you that's it

357
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,710
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't read Russian most</font>

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,710
people don't but hey

359
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:25,329
you know how we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this even easier</font>

360
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:27,610
google translate awesome it's so now

361
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:28,868
we're in and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to play</font>

362
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit so we're going to</font>

363
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:34,569
get real experimental with this server

364
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:38,139
start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the second base if you</font>

365
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:39,849
will right so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

366
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,709
playing the functionality and then we

367
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,769
come across another page that seems to

368
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,939
generate a file given some input we'll

369
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,980
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a peek at what it looks like right</font>

370
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:49,779
now I didn't put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google translate</font>

371
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,199
version up there but essentially at the

372
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,819
top you provided a block of text you're

373
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,589
supposed to provide it a key parameter

374
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:59,529
and then it will insert a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

375
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:02,079
spam keywords based off of that the

376
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,209
second one links<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other text files</font>

377
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are sitting on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server and these</font>

378
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:10,388
are pretty much just lists of keywords

379
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:13,059
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one link per each keyword</font>

380
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:15,459
if that makes sense and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

381
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:20,139
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much just the output</font>

382
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:22,628
file name that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use so we</font>

383
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:24,309
start submitting things then this is

384
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,290
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hyperlink to our new file that</font>

385
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:32,049
got generated which ends up looking like

386
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:34,059
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome now why is that</font>

387
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">special what does this mean that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

388
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:40,059
on the server at this point

389
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:42,100
realistically thank you we have write

390
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,049
access on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server which pretty much</font>

391
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,799
means we kind of have arbitrary file

392
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:51,730
upload right now because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

393
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:54,910
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever text we put in and make a</font>

394
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,399
file using whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> file name we want we</font>

395
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,490
could probably upload PHP code but the

396
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">only issue is out of the list of</font>

397
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,130
keywords there's no file in there that

398
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:08,230
only has one single line of keywords so

399
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,360
we need to ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that whatever code we</font>

400
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,370
upload only execute once does anyone

401
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,819
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any idea on what the best way to do</font>

402
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,819
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

403
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,730
he could but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeats the purpose</font>

404
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,099
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better just use comment blocks</font>

405
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,390
honestly right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start with a closed</font>

406
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,459
block for an HTML comment and then PHP

407
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,460
comments and it ensures that every other

408
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,110
line of PHP code gets commented out this

409
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,620
ensures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whatever we're doing is</font>

410
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,570
only going to execute once so we upload

411
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,860
our web shell and if you you can't

412
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,360
really make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out but in the upper left</font>

413
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,439
you can see our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> little HTML</font>

414
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:51,050
comment block it's really that easy it

415
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,670
shouldn't be this easy now we don't have

416
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,050
root on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server necessarily right</font>

417
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,929
we're running with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server</font>

418
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,120
permissions but we'll go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

419
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,710
poking around on the website turns out

420
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:07,159
we come across yet another login panel

421
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,960
we owned it so with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> findings we see</font>

422
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,900
the new login page and it looks like

423
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's use inductive reasoning</font>

424
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,940
here right it really can't be this easy

425
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,710
there's no way this guy's that done that

426
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,760
he used the exact same credentials for

427
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:32,150
this login page<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm no way in hell one</font>

428
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:35,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">two one two one two and we wait no god</font>

429
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:38,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">damn it so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked using the same</font>

430
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,460
passwords credential reuse there's your

431
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,639
vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's even more</font>

432
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,080
right we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this new login</font>

433
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,970
panel and I don't know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make</font>

434
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,169
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at the bottom here and I wasn't</font>

435
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">even using google translate at this</font>

436
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:54,620
point but that string says system by an

437
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,940
email address active shells at this

438
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,389
point was thirty thousand nine hundred

439
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,390
sixty but that email address<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

440
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:09,460
we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking around on the site we</font>

441
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,039
see the single web server but there's

442
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,450
many other URLs that will work basically

443
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's got like an engine X proxy and then</font>

444
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,360
you know different serves up different

445
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,179
pages depending on whatever domain

446
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,760
you're visiting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> s turns out there's a</font>

447
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:25,779
bug tracker located at<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracked the c2</font>

448
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,760
domain org there's also a legitimate

449
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,649
website running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this web server as</font>

450
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,019
well and by legitimate I legitimately

451
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:35,469
mean legitimate it's just a Russian car

452
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:37,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">form that operates as a business now now</font>

453
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,490
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this is getting a lot</font>

454
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">more interesting but we're going to go</font>

455
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,880
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just take a peek at the bug</font>

456
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,189
tracker real quick and unfortunately

457
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,010
once you went to 12 didn't work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

458
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,750
case but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have access to the</font>

459
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,059
server we could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a file</font>

460
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,659
that has hashes in them which we did

461
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:58,418
right there's an epr hash now with the

462
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,070
thing with hashes is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

463
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,350
have a word list it has a password in it

464
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,658
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way I'm going to get into</font>

465
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,480
this and since I'm not root I can't edit

466
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,980
the hash regardless we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

467
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,470
our hand at cracking it there's a great

468
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,500
utility I use hash cat if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

469
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,059
powerful enough video card you can use

470
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,720
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> CL hash cat or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CUDA hash code</font>

471
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:23,879
depending if AMD or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nvidia the fact that</font>

472
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,809
I have a 980 GTX does not hurt at all

473
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Saran it through a word list in the</font>

474
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,139
admin password ended up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank you</font>

475
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,659
to w3 easd that at first looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

476
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:37,209
secure password right if you have a

477
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,750
keyboard in front of you get the look at

478
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:43,090
the password it's just a hand pattern

479
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,980
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of wordless out there</font>

480
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,980
that take cut stuff like this into

481
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,779
effect right so you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull some of</font>

482
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">these worthless down try it against the</font>

483
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:56,260
hash and then you're magically in so now

484
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're in the bug tracker and this</font>

485
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,740
is ran through google translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font>

486
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking around and it's the it's the</font>

487
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,630
actual bug tracker to that legitimate

488
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,668
car forum website the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

489
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,250
interesting was we came across this part

490
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:12,549
here that says team or engineer

491
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,370
statistics now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can</font>

492
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:17,530
tell but this right here

493
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,659
has a name associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Sergey our</font>

494
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,330
homeboys<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sergei as I like to refer to</font>

495
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,770
him as that<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah that's</font>

496
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same email address we just saw</font>

497
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,760
earlier which kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of brings me to my</font>

498
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,960
next point right about attribution

499
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,809
attribution is supposed to be really

500
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">really difficult the NSA uses a</font>

501
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,050
technique they like to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

502
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">collection and what that essentially</font>

503
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,250
means is that they log in and they find

504
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,110
botnets on the internet they take those

505
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,930
botnets over and then they put their own

506
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,909
botnet hidden on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> server the reason</font>

507
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that is if their operation ever gets</font>

508
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,070
compromised attribution is shifted from

509
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:57,490
the NSA to whatever guy is running that

510
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:00,850
botnet right the whole goal is that I'm

511
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,340
placing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blame on someone else that</font>

512
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,129
again if done correctly attribution is

513
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,840
supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult the only</font>

514
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue is if you want to feel lead and</font>

515
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,100
you want to let your ego get in the way

516
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,500
and then you put your email associated

517
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,120
with things or you're running illegal

518
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,530
stuff at the same time as<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal stuff</font>

519
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,070
that you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name associated with</font>

520
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:24,340
that's just a major op SEC fail going

521
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,830
back we see system by blanket<font color="#E5E5E5"> live.com</font>

522
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,659
and then cert are at home boy Sergei and

523
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,270
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address which is the same</font>

524
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,000
email address now that's not solid proof

525
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:37,720
at all right we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting close but it</font>

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,160
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of case but</font>

527
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,300
it's like we

528
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,740
hey guy is he's possibly associated

529
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,790
intimate website and the spin operation

530
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,190
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about open source</font>

531
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,680
intelligence with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google it's really</font>

532
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,790
hard to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all I had to do was take</font>

533
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:00,490
Sergey and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google his email address very</font>

534
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult this takes us to another</font>

535
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:11,440
website another Russian car forum which

536
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:13,060
gives us<font color="#CCCCCC"> drum roll please anyone ha hey</font>

537
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,800
I know what Sergei looks like now right

538
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,030
he's got a girlfriend apparently he

539
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,950
drives a BMW III he lives in a the city

540
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,420
is given here but he lives in the

541
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:29,080
Ukraine oh and I have his last name now

542
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're getting somewhere so back on</font>

543
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,620
open source intelligence now we have

544
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,360
additional data points we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use right</font>

545
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,449
so we're going to do a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

546
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:45,100
OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent and can you guess what I did M</font>

547
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:48,510
plus the city plus the country what do

548
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,510
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came across next</font>

549
00:23:52,980 --> 00:24:01,179
BK so VK is quite literally a Russian

550
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,010
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook right now I didn't</font>

551
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:05,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a profile for this this</font>

552
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,910
is all publicly available and I know you

553
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,080
guys see this all the time yes some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

554
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,080
you something you may have kids that

555
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,030
have that that share everything on their

556
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,760
facebook profile and it's all set to

557
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,899
public looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the photo you could</font>

558
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,740
tell he was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little cold in</font>

559
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but that being said we're going to</font>

560
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:28,150
start VK stalking this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I want</font>

561
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,710
to see everything that he's posted to

562
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,070
this website because he doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:42,000
foresight to make anything private so

564
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:42,000
the first thing I come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yeah</font>

565
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">home boy Sergei was born in 1995 he's 20</font>

566
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,750
years old this is his<font color="#E5E5E5"> driver's license</font>

567
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,030

to drive a car so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the first</font>

569
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,510
thing he<font color="#E5E5E5"> does when he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gets his driver's</font>

come across this here right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

575
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:16,210
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have the need to talk</font>

576
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">about work on their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook this still</font>

he's familiar with PHP this is all PHP

579
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,309
code and he's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a comment</font>

580
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,120
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says really as though this</font>

581
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-in that he's analyzing his crap but</font>

582
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> being said we know he has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

583
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,450
familiarity with PHP the great<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

584
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,540
about this was that everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we</font>

585
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,760
looked at was all written in PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

586
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,059
fine still not one hundred percent sure

587
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,879
that this is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sergei until we</font>

588
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:49,240
get to this photo which is a Kanban

589
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,640
board right now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

590
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,790
see the hashtags at the bottom there but

591
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,860
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is tagged hashtag the URL to</font>

592
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,480
that Russian car forum website which is

593
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the legitimate website running on this</font>

594
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:06,970
c2 server the next hashtag is work as in

595
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,200
I work here

596
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,789
at this point it's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid</font>

597
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,169
proof that this is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sergey that</font>

598
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:16,190
we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before which is a</font>

599
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:22,120
massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC failure don't suck at</font>

600
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">OPSEC it's just really really really bad</font>

601
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,399
so we're gonna learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

602
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Sergei because hey facebook</font>

603
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,409
stalking<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's fun right he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

604
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:33,770
party I mean this guy goes out in clubs

605
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:35,779
he drives an m5 he had a hotter girl

606
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:41,510
friend before but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was told I couldn't</font>

607
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:46,039
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay his new one really is kind of</font>

608
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,200
like he likes cats and he takes a

609
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,960
stereotypical photo of throwing money on

610
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:58,789
the desk and with his I'm night<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

611
00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:01,610
gonna go<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I'm sorry so the best</font>

612
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:07,549
part was what he dressed up for is

613
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:11,809
Halloween the smiley<font color="#E5E5E5"> faces just make it</font>

614
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:13,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">more creepy I'm sorry so we're going to</font>

615
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:17,299
touch a little bit on his massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font>

616
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:19,010
fails and some takeaways from this right

617
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,990
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do anything illegal on</font>

618
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet don't associate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your real</font>

619
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,559
name with it that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not smart to do</font>

620
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,929
at all Grug always get is a great piece

621
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice use a different handle for</font>

622
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:36,230
every different operation that you're

623
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing right this this has</font>

624
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,860
caused so many fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> lil psych is a</font>

625
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,049
great example you hack to CIA<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet CIA's</font>

626
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,408
website right but you never change your

627
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:49,639
handles so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next tax that you're</font>

628
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:50,960
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're still claiming oh this</font>

629
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,640
is under the banner of low sec oh this

630
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,049
is under the banner of Sabu whatever you

631
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,830
can kind of start doing pattern based

632
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:02,750
analysis based off of what with this

633
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,970
hack was similar to this act since we

634
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,440
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the same individual was</font>

635
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,909
performing it also you probably

636
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,480
shouldn't run malware on your work

637
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,480
server lips

638
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:20,970
like come on now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stronger passwords</font>

639
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:29,280
I mean there's things out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> keepass</font>

640
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:31,920
last past why why my point was doing

641
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,100
this was extremely cheap right and the

642
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,160
hacking was laughable ridiculously easy

643
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,689
none of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hard you can legitimately</font>

644
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,970
learn how to do any of this in a week

645
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,880
and I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes for every</font>

646
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,390
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in this room the best part</font>

647
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:53,280
was everything was 100% open source and

648
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:55,920
free that being said here's my contact

649

654
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,750
all fences so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as offensive tools</font>

655
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">kali linux usually has a lot of really</font>

656
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,270
good stuff there's other things hit him

657
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,930
on the repository<font color="#CCCCCC"> but realistically the</font>

658
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,910
best tool in any hackers toolbox is

659
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google I'd be out of a job if it wasn't</font>

660
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,860
for Google you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pretty much get</font>

661
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,480
anything that you need on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google as far</font>

662
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,350
as investigation tools go guess what the

663
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one is google um coo coo sandbox</font>

664
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:41,280
again makes this ridiculously easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> js2</font>

665
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">talks 4d ossification javascript and as</font>

666
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,840
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> offset goes i will really praised</font>

667
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,610
Grug he does a fantastic job at making

668
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,370
suggestions were doing analysis on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ops</font>

669
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:56,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">like failures read his blog posts follow</font>

670
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,629
his twitter and just absorb the

671
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,840
information that he puts out there

672
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it is really good now if you</font>

673
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,379
need a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity and as far as</font>

674
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,510
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know makes shell accounts</font>

675
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,940
right four different operations use fake

676
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,430
name generator<font color="#CCCCCC"> com it provides you so</font>

677
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,450
much info that you have to do literally

678
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,830
no thinking you hit go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will give</font>

679
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,150
you a name it'll give you an address

680
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,970
it'll give you a fake social security

681
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,620
number it'll give you an entire identity

682
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,380
that you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell accounts based</font>

683
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,729
around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last resource</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

684
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,919
talk about is Hemingway

685
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,020
and the reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is</font>

686
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,510
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called like language</font>

687
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,668
analysis right so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write a piece of</font>

688
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,160
code I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as my own personal</font>

689
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,480
unique writing style as I write more and

690
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,740
more code or as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write more and more</font>

691
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,390
malware even if I go in and take into

692
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,890
account oh I'm using different handles

693
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,309
I'm using different infrastructure if

694
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,480
the writing pattern is still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

695
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:54,120
that's still something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

696
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,890
investigator<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use so take a block of</font>

697
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,320
text uploading upload it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hemingway</font>

698
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:02,160
app and the whole goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is to make</font>

699
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,860
a block of text simpler so easy a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5th</font>

700
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,660
grader could read it right which

701
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,879
essentially will change your writing

702
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,790
style entirely you can write however you

703
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,190
want upload it change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code or change</font>

704
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,350
the the texts around and suddenly it's

705
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,590
no longer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of style that</font>

706
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:21,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">you use does that make sense so that's</font>

707
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,740
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all i have if anyone has any</font>

708
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions hey we have plenty of time for</font>

709
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:35,910
questions nothing illegal I mean it's

710
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,679
literally nothing illegal it's not like

711
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to give you a real identity</font>

712
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,570
or anything it's just a block of text oh

713
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,290
I'm sorry I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the quite the</font>

714
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,610
question was what were the legalities

715
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,610
associated with fake name generator

716
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,119
so pathetically right at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> was how did</font>

717
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:05,609
this hypothetical situation

718
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,958
hypothetically end there's a few things

719
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:08,070
you could do and again that goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

720
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,769
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying it really depends on</font>

721
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">what your ultimate goal was</font>

722
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,109
hypothetically if you were contracted by

723
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:16,499
organizations should investigate a piece

724
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:17,849
or somewhere we thought you find the

725
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,959
attribution of this guy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know who</font>

726
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,820
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but at same time he also</font>

727
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:23,999
generator k is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise that's</font>

728
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,529
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much all you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do um I'm</font>

729
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:27,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AI</font>

730
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:30,329
really hate talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the police and B</font>

731
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:32,070
I don't like dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the police so</font>

732
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:33,178
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave that up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to up to the</font>

733
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,668
the customer that I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

734
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigation for is it really worth</font>

735
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:41,669
their time to chase after this guy

736
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:43,349
probably not you know hypothetically you

737
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:45,869
could do a number of things at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

738
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:48,928
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> right something that i would</font>

739
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:51,238
suggest would be to actually just hey

740
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:53,009
keep your shell on this on this guy's

741
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:55,469
server right not only do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you own</font>

742
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:56,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally everything he owns not only</font>

743
00:32:55,469 --> 00:33:00,570
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you steal money from him at any</font>

744
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:02,339
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me out</font>

745
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,718
hear me out hear me up the important

746
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,418
part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can actually</font>

747
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:09,539
monitor and see how these operations are

748
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,829
going right so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it'll evolve</font>

749
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,599
he'll sit there and update the code

750
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:15,299
he'll put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new versions of dined or</font>

751
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,009
whatever he's using and you can pretty

752
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:21,440
much just generate new indicators based

753
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,440
off of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if he will have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

754
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,730
hi it's like radical I don't know as far

755
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,890
as far as the laws that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

756
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,390
from getting in turn outside server

757
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:45,940
again hypothetical situation it doesn't

758
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company's website make sure</font>

759
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to check linkedin see if they work there</font>

760
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,340
and the tag give your name but<font color="#CCCCCC"> phi and</font>

761
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:57,970
then whoever works there Oh programmer

762
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,939
and then attribution problem solved

763
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just point them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who works</font>

764
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:08,290
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go head absolutely so the</font>

765
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,630
the comment was essentially as an

766
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,040
attacker you could literally just take

767
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,350
someone else's email address and tack<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

768
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their sure yes that's completely</font>

769
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,110
true and again that goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i</font>

770
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,259
was saying attribution is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

771
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:23,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you certainly should do</font>

772
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't happen in this case</font>

773
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:43,140
hypothetically yes basically loading

774
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:49,510
ransomware web server and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

775
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:51,549
absolutely absolutely absolutely so the

776
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,130
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was hypothetically would it be</font>

777
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,540
hypothetically possible to upload

778
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,400
ransomware and encrypt everything on the

779
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,740
server and hypothetically I may have

780
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,800
hypothetically fought of taking that

781
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:05,830
same malware sample and encrypting all

782
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,880
his files using his own ransomware cuz

783
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:15,210
that's just hilarious right

784
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,210
hypothetically any further questions

785
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:22,559
alright this has been owning owners like

786
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,559
a noob
