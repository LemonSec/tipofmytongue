pretty common around that time was not

stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh this school kept doing it up</font>

Division one sports championship teams

you add up all the schools which had

predictable sink once first three digits

is just the location where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">administration was nice enough to tell</font>

you when what numbers were valid in

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,330
there because they needed some way for

said is just a sequential and this

88
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,549
becomes really important because the IRS

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,220
started requiring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Social Security</font>

sure you had a legitimate tax deduction

92
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,849
around the same time there's an

they were done at the pots we were born

out the first five digits for sixty

percent of the population within two

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,400
attempts so if you the last digits are

109
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,479
known that's where all the potential

110
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,500

created a proof of concept last year

sites that they're competing with each

247
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,329
eventually maybe especially if you could

fair warning but uh this is uh this is

whomever the suspect was basically was

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,010
especially said he's going into

451
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,530
pre-trial intervention he wrote a five

page handwritten x.x essay explaining

453
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,428
why he did is bad you took a drug test

454
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,929
and theoretically the charge was

455

discharged but the court record<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

feel if he stumbled upon the record

saying this guy went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this thing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">even if he does hand you the paperwork</font>

466
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,130
think no one is playing playing for bulk

467
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,600
access to scraping this record website

468
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,120
you're kidding yourself there's lots of

469
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,280
firms not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nexus LexisNexis and</font>

470
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,639
big-name firms like those looking at

471
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,379
court records uh you use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places</font>

472
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,390
you can kind of get information like

473
00:18:50,380 --> 00:19:01,299
this and guess at this point of any

474
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:04,210
questions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font>

475
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then saying oh I'm dead talking</font>

476
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,760
about a public information in various

477
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,250
ways it can be found so focus on how

478
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">profit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> practices security professionals</font>

479
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,820
and system designers fortunately at

480
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,130
least my personal view protecting

481
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,740
against public information as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

482
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,410
people compromising information stuff

483
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,990
like that fall is much the same approach

484
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,790
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go too much into</font>

485
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,630
authorization because access rights tend

486
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,909
to be pretty system specific

487
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:38,110
historically we used to use security

488
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:40,260
questions and stuff like that many quick

489
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,668
crown with the security questions is

490
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,270
many answers are easily found in public

491
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,190
record to social secure also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google did</font>

492
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,330
a study and they found forty percent of

493
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,150
users forgot their answers to the

494
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,470
security questions of a top top of that

495

what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people may just throw</font>

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,340

put in there that weren't the real

499
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,870
answers often were the same

<font color="#CCCCCC">uh-oh if you've also with security</font>

questions you might not know they're

really is unfortunately this is going

away<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but the current trend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

515
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,350
say generally is at least what's kind of

516
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,090
ironically is when with all the data

517
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,490
braces in the news what I was noticed

518
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,709
over the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or so is everyone is</font>

519
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,690
asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more information here's</font>

520
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,640
Microsoft after the secure there's their

521
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,920
privacy policy update asking for more

522
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,210
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite sure why they</font>

523
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,800
didn't have this information before

524
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,920
grinning have had a Microsoft account

525
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,270
for a year it's also nursing usability

526
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,720
example because they asked twice for the

527
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,030
same information but really what I

528
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,950
really started<font color="#E5E5E5"> last I think really</font>

529
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,480
happened is everyone realized last year

530
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,310
with all the data breaches in the news

531
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,680
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really couldn't trust who they</font>

532
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,990
were doing dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just purely the</font>

533
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,600
way they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing it so what what's</font>

534
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,190
been going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is little more and more</font>

535
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,550
websites that doing some swarm of two

536
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,690
factor authentication to factor is when

537
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,290
you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know along with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with the two-factor authentication is</font>

540
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,140
everyone seems to have their own

541
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,690
solution some groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do phone calls</font>

542
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,910
and SMS messages others use this system

543
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,590
called open authentication Google

544
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,070
Authenticator actually is a pretty good

545
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:50,260
example of open authentication basically

546
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,149
it lets you the sights you deal with all

547
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">generate secrets and then it just</font>

548
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,650
updates the thing either every time the

549
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:00,670
display appears or every at set timing

550
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,010
furtles you can do here is it shown you

551
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,790
can all don't miss is everyone who what

552
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,950
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the open authentication</font>

553
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,629
generate unique token so here someone

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,530
has a personal one in one for their

555
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,120
employer but it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple everyone</font>

556
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,779
just use the same Authenticator we can't

<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly</font>

that bug but not every financial state

586
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:21,789
will not or site will let you get away

587
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,979
with not providing information like this

588
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:25,450
this also is the nearest an example

589
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:29,080
where this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first websites</font>

593
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:39,009
so even banking sites are playing with

594
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,830
third-party trackers now and it's not

596
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,830
bit of an aside when a company wants you

597
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:47,529
to provide something whether it's

727
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,570
this likely primarily now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,010
pretty harmless example i badgered

729
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,669
there's not a radio inside of your

734
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,040
i had a problem this probably comes into

735
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,780
play is unless them figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with unit and how it worked</font>

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:23,500
this is a rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> but benign example of</font>

738
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,360
analytics analytics is the discovery and

communication of meaningful patterns and

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,900
to separate these two apart<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it's</font>

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to know how everyone's traveling</font>

746

i skipped some election example so just

but anyone can obtain the records to say

806
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,440
yes you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've even received postcards</font>

815
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,080
going on there I it anyways at this

816
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:41,750
point I'd normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about web</font>

analytics but Cooper<font color="#CCCCCC"> kenton the next</font>

speaker is going to do an entire session

819
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,290
on web analytics so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to we</font>

820
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,570
talked in vance and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus</font>

821
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,360
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world examples and he'll handle</font>

822
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:56,270
the non real worlds the internet style

823
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,299
stuff but i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to steal one</font>

824
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:01,220
little thing from from his the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system's</font>

dr. running furnished<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed Frontier</font>

826
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,490
Foundation has and look at the panoptic

827
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,850
click system is this is really an odds

828
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,500
game so you have a lot of little details

829
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,360
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which you don't know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

830
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,480
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an eye chart but it's like this</font>

831
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,550
field over here is one the field over

832
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,000
here is one index browsers have this

833
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,480
value right and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those fields say</font>

834
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,980
one in one so it's not

835
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,850
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are unique on their own</font>

836
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:29,309
but my browser is unique among the over

837
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,139
136,000 that websites tested but so it's

838
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,330
but not necessarily all of this is

839
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,090
needed say my<font color="#E5E5E5"> times don't change because</font>

840
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,860
I'm in and I'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> California if the rest</font>

841
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,770
of the information stole matt is it's

842
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,000
still likely me if my web user agent or

843
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,668
my web browser changes because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

upgraded it and it's a new version it's

845
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:52,500
still probably me right and where this

846
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,000
really comes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

that in January but prior to that they

1043

said oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> look we have a HIPAA interface</font>

1056
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,830
interesting what applies just like

1057
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,600
mandatory arbitration clauses users may

1058
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,310

1060
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,900
legal text also worth noting like many

1061
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,190
websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> hickies term estate says says</font>

1062
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,970
their system does not give medical

1063
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,980
advice yet they

1064
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,020
published studies saying look using our

1065
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,020

blood pressure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down as a medical</font>

1067
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,180
outcome there is there a correlation

1068
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,500
correlation that's potentially medically

1069
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,440
interesting yes and so how could it not

1070
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:36,790
be medical advice if it potentially

1071
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,490
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure in short let me just</font>

1072
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:41,800
quickly finish up is everyone wants to

<font color="#E5E5E5">have their cake and eat it too consumers</font>

want to have accurate predictions but

1075
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,560
they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to necessarily know</font>

everything about everyone businesses

00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,250
want to beat their competitors by having

1078

a secret sauce but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible to protect broken</font>

1088
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:15,130
kind of see that now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> relay this</font>

1089
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,630
okay with this encryption debates<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1090
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,190
we want a back door but we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1091
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,890
a factor we don't want anyone else to

1092
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,609
have a back door and really that's very

1093
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:26,529
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> if not possible to do the</font>

1094
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,410
acceptable answers to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this will</font>

1095
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,970
probably verify country and society you

1096
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">may have China and sis we must have your</font>

1097
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,930
source code in back doors you may have

1098
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,790
the USA or europe say no we you can't

1099
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,200
and this could make very things very

1100
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:41,770
difficult for us trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop</font>

1101
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,569
technology sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the catch is with all of</font>

1102
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you have to hunt down the truth all</font>

1103
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:49,839
too often researchers find ways to take

1104
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,009
information information<font color="#CCCCCC"> claims is not</font>

1105
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,470
personally identifying and use it

saw this week was someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a way to</font>

00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,150
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our users by their mouse</font>

1109
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,609
movements ah the worth also noting that

1110
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,080
of mouse movements are commonly used to

1111
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:06,520
generate heat maps to figure out where

1112

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested on a website which is</font>

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,280
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for misleading arguments</font>

you about as well I'm it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm not</font>

that crazy and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way this is a very</font>

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> book if you haven't read it he</font>

1122
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,600
doesn't presume your statistics person

1123
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,550
this book is

1124
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,170
print the date examples are bit dated

1125
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:37,010
because but the book is over 60 years

1126
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,570
old and stolen print so it's also

1127
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,850
believe there's also a copy an archive

1128
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,860
org of an older version i don't know if

1129
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:48,200
it's supposed to disassemble their but

1130
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:50,360
that's copyright law for you if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

go away if you want to try at such

00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,860
blocking software do but realize some

1140
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,629
websites block you nowadays and these

1141
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,580
can occasionally break websites if you

1142
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,380
track too much if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dock</font>

1143
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,330
someone can see if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

it you will affect feelings as i

1145
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:19,640
mentioned maybe legal implications<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1146
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,799
really the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can think you</font>

1147
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,839
should do this is if you're researching

1148
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,250
your family history there's case when I

1149
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,530
first gave this talk i believe around

<font color="#E5E5E5">november of someone posted in social</font>
