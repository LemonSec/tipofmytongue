1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:19,849
all right morning my name is Vikram it's

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,820
my third time<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at besides proud to</font>

3
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,470
be back and thanks to Jeff and Jonathan

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,960
I think they're in here can't see him

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:34,040
but thanks to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of them having</font>

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:36,410
back here again anyhow today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,309
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about securing the</font>

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:44,690
Internet of Things this word or term

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:47,959
really got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of buzz behind it sort</font>

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of 2015 was kind of the big year a lot</font>

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,739
of investment funding but intubate a lot

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,350
of companies got started doing this

13
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:55,519
stuff but it's kind of like the early

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,989
days of the internet we don't really

15
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,210
have a clue what we're really doing

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,280
we're hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work out and you</font>

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,230
know we get enough funding and so on to

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue doing those cool kind of things</font>

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm one of the few people fortunate</font>

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,620
enough to be in a lab environment that I

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,250
can play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and I don't</font>

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,080
have to worry too much about

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,050
consequences as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I get to write</font>

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,300
some papers and so on those are hard to

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,830
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway so what are we going</font>

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:24,890
to cover today um not too much but when

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,240
I start by defining<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I OT is a lot</font>

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have a lot of different</font>

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,500
definitions I'm going to use a standard

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of my own in this talk after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,610
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few industries and areas</font>

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,940
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OT is very prevalent it's</font>

33
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,920
growing very very very fast I mean

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,929
that's why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all the buzz behind</font>

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,130
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's penetrating a lot of</font>

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,680
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> industries so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

37
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">a look at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those are afterwards it</font>

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,890
talk very briefly about some startups

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,440
that are building<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot stuff then the</font>

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,200
current state of security in IOT which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,179
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> say right now is very bad but we'll</font>

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,250
get more into how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly in a bit</font>

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,710
and finally I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,470
contributions to the area where I come

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,369
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm giving the socket so on</font>

46
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:13,060
all right um I OT recently has been

47
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,610
feeling like kind of a a nervous system

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,290
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hardware and software it's</font>

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like the old hardware</font>

50
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,340
abstraction layer if you know from old

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,319
colonel days it that used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in its</font>

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,950
still in in some places got taken out in

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,530
some other destroy

54
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,040
us but it gives life to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

55
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before were separated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just on</font>

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,950
their own with that the big deal with

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,140
IOT is its communication particularly

58
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,599
communication between devices and

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,140
sensors this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a very very very</font>

60
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,549
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal and the reason is quite simple</font>

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">too many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different devices do not</font>

62
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,989
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other they just you know</font>

63
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,610
if you've used a printer you know what

64
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about i mean it just you</font>

65
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,090
know things just don't work out and

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,500
another thing has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of big</font>

67
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,959
consulting firms are gotten her being

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,560
one of them they send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a report that</font>

69
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:14,660
around 20 million devices will be up in

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,560
the cloud very shortly at these are 20

71
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,120
million that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be top</font>

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,000
performing so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4G</font>

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,150
LTE<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe 5 g and so on you know</font>

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,980
these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are online and pretty much</font>

75
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,160
everything that's coming out now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

76
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">even cars have LTE and come on now but</font>

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,389
anyway having those facilities and

78
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,670
capabilities also makes you vulnerable

79
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:37,190
you're going to see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this team</font>

80
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,809
repeat having more features is good but

81
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,319
you do not need an ftp server on our

82
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,209
printer that's just come on that's it's

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,160
fine to have but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder to secure</font>

84
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,690
you have to always a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,040
assume our security research just you

86
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,780
always have to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the assumption</font>

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,760
that people will not configure devices

88
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,350
the right way they're supposed to be

89
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,200
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use things out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box</font>

90
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,079
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the easiest way to get</font>

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in it work now that's fine for</font>

92
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,440
most things but if you have an ftp

93
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,930
server running that has one two three

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,069
four is password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know you could</font>

95
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,900
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very serious trouble</font>

96
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,060
incidentally uh one of the

97
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,299
vulnerabilities that Stuxnet the huge

98
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,829
you know corporate espionage malware it

99
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:20,150
took advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the printer</font>

100
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:21,650
vulnerabilities and you know it don't

101
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,820
meal if you read they have a comic

102
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,710
that's you know printers are from hell

103
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,090
it's it's pretty funny if you've read it

104
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,900
but it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what I'm</font>

105
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking anyway back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT stuff in IOT</font>

106
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,440
the Holy Grail<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the main goal is that</font>

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,909
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish a network it</font>

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,830
could be a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be a public</font>

109
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,849
network but it is a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of connected</font>

110
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,889
devices

111
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,119
these the core requirement and probably

112
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,740
the only requirement that you can

113
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,899
satisfy<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

114
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,469
devices have<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

115
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:53,990
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see shortly how they do up</font>

116
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:57,199
devices now a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different devices</font>

117
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,539
you know are converging in a sense that

118
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have we look at mobile phones</font>

119
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,409
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very good example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung has</font>

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,779
their own stuff you know touch with and

121
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:08,110
so on but it can still load the same

122
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:11,089
sort of apps that my Nexus would load or

123
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,189
you know the Sony Xperia phones or any

124
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,709
of them would load that the

125
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:17,300
infrastructure being different but the

126
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:19,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">software that runs out on top of it</font>

127
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,740
being about the same that's kind of what

128
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,949
I OTS going for but at a much deeper

129
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,330
level much deeper as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system-level</font>

130
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,860
devices need to be you know talk like

131
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,599
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font>

132
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,629
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other but more so they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

133
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,669
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data that is a very very</font>

134
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:36,679
difficult challenge to solve when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

135
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,169
look at right here you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the left</font>

136
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:40,698
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> economist and talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about in a</font>

137
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,180
language of Internet of Things right

138
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,129
side that's why sand bottom one from

139
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,809
another blog but you know all of them

140
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,490
pointing out the same things people

141
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:51,709
saying that you know can the internet

142
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,589
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unified that way if you've</font>

143
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:56,719
worked with firmwares and devices at you

144
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,339
know very sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system level you'll</font>

145
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:01,699
see how difficult it is for them to

146
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:04,579
really talk and even share data message

147
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,499
passing protocols and MPs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenMP and</font>

148
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:08,419
so on those are what some of the common

149
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,159
sophistication is we use you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a</font>

150
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,438
lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> setting so if you're developing a</font>

151
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,029
server cluster farm or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

152
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,729
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you would talk from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

153
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,300
them is message passing but that doesn't

154
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">translate very well to sort of system</font>

155
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,579
level stuff I've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on some</font>

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,139
of this so you're taking known

157
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:30,169
principles in message passing and

158
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,689
converting them over to sort of system

159
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,029
level Internet of Things devices one

160
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,969
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this stuff happens to</font>

161
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:40,519
be that you could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the devices on</font>

162
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:44,329
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same backbone if you</font>

163
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:47,120
will the same protocols that's probably

164
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:49,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to happen very low chance of</font>

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,019
it device manufacturers are very very

166
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,620
bad at talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other about this</font>

167
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,720
perfectly

work graphics drivers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work alone was</font>

a major pain leave alone getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

173
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,169

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them happening but there's progress</font>

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,130
one of the ones you know when Google

176
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,169
does something they generally do it

177
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,969
right at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least as we're hoping for one</font>

178
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,940
of the recent ones that came up during

179
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,510
the last io was this combination of

180
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,180
something called brillo and weave wave

181
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,949
is not sure if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can see the</font>

182
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,490
pictures very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but basically it is</font>

183
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,830
it the idea is that these devices are

184
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,030
going to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the stock</font>

185
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,960
androids on your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they're going</font>

186
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run the sort of a stripped-down</font>

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,169
version minimalistic version of Android

188
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:43,220
which will power all five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six of</font>

189
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,400
these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to put in</font>

190
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,440
the in the cloud and because they're on

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,780
the same infrastructure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hope</font>

192
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,940
that getting them to talk to each other

193
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,770
getting them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share data take input</font>

194
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,590
converted into output that's a lot

195
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do given that they're on the</font>

196
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,179
same infrastructure nest is a company

197
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,370
that you know is now under google they

198
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,990
are recently released<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called</font>

199
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,200
nest weave that's their own

200
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,510
implementation and basically it is one

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,330
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first home home automation sort</font>

202
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,070
of ideas that use a common

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,260
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can imagine one day</font>

204
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,820
you have the same device that you know

205
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,699
the same stuff that's powering your

206
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,159
phone maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> even your car and your home</font>

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,349
you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same seamless</font>

208
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,320
interface from one to another and they

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,849
can all communicate very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we was</font>

210
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">only a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the puzzle because</font>

211
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,830
we've only lets you talk two things

212
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,140
that's not the all the way there the

213
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,779
complete solution is brillo you guys

214
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,600
might recall this slide from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Android</font>

215
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,459
or from google i/o when they did it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

216
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
just took it right from there but it

217
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows something very nicely at the</font>

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,830
bottom level is hardware hardware could

219
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,810
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but as long as it can be</font>

220
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,730
made to run linux you're making some

221
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,040
progress on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which is the</font>

222
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">colonel on top of the the colonel</font>

223
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,930
basically manages the hardware to

224
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,700
software interactions on top of the

225
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,540
colonel is HL the hardware abstraction

226
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,949
layer

227
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,769
this is where some really neat stuff

228
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:12,410
happens because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take hardware</font>

229
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,990
that's similar enough for example USB

230
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,310
you know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> universal because most</font>

231
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,079
of them can operate on similar

232
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,329
principles if you can take hard work

233
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,359
that's similar enough in abstract sort

234
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,579
of the core object and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about object</font>

235
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,100
orientation if you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

236
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:30,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach a very it's very easy to reach a</font>

237
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,940
consensus on devices being able to

238
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,079
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus is something I'll get</font>

239
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,029
into in a little bit and why it's

240
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,040
important but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important that we</font>

241
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,509
can authenticate devices properly as far

242
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,209
as one of the biggest security flaws in

243
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,560
IOT and we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shortly now what</font>

244
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,869
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other line in terms</font>

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,849
of hardware you can see here it's very

246
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,009
easy on top of hell we can build

247
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,290
everything most common linux

248
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,449
distributions either use hell or

249
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,339
something something else that's similar

250
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,889
to hell to build a lot of connectivity

251
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,540
and hardware services we use them you

252
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if you have a linux distribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

253
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,910
here on your computer what is being done

254
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,939
on the last the black box which is

255
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,980
hardware itself linux foundation

256
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,269
announced a initiative called project

257
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,190
yocto it's a common operating system for

258
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,199
embedded devices a lot of embedded

259
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,990
devices are running it currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

260
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:22,370
of them use it huge industry partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

261
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,199
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel you know a lot of the big</font>

262
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,639
ones are are in it contributing code to

263
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:27,740
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the hope is still the same</font>

264
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,110
though because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the same</font>

265
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,649
backbone we can get these devices to

266
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,769
work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to each other well enough</font>

267
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,180
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over really quick what it looks like</font>

268
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like a nightmare but it's</font>

269
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,479
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot easier than that i'm not</font>

270
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the whole picture but</font>

271
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,670
the point basically is you have you know

272
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,380
in debian or or in any package

273
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,029
management system you have something

274
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">like apt-get you know you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type that</font>

275
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,560
in type of package and it installs it

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,199
now think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the similar similar</font>

277
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,849
principle but applied to hardware and

278
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,819
software drivers you just have one

279
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,370
script a 10 line script that runs in

280
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:07,069
each of those 10 lines it installs the

281
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,980
exact sort of the same operating system

282
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,810
including drivers on all five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or six of</font>

283
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">your devices that's kind of the idea</font>

284
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,930
behind project<font color="#CCCCCC"> yocto you can see on the</font>

285
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,640
right side the same package feeds

286
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,939
basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same repositories are</font>

287
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,300
um all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different flavors of yogurt</font>

288
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available and in the end they</font>

289
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,109
all get compiled into the images<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

290
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,329
run on devices if you've tried never

291
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,950
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> yocto in uh in your you know small</font>

292
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,920
virtual machine or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something i highly</font>

293
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend giving it a try it is amazing</font>

294
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact it just the simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing fact</font>

295
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,260
that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out there that</font>

296
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,150
can support eight or nine different

297
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,340
devices give a Raspberry Pi that's a

298
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,170
very good tutorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's several good</font>

299
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,660
tutorials on running<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> York toe on it</font>

300
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,920
basically gives you a very nice system

301
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,390
level access to the Raspberry Pi and let

302
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,370
you do crazy things you can do whatever

303
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,920
you want with it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the going back to</font>

304
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,960
the something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier the very</font>

305
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,689
simple fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this can happen that</font>

306
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,250
alone is amazing because historically

307
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,560
it's been incredibly hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get device</font>

308
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,210
manufacturers to agree on building

309
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,209
something like this to begin with

310
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so been talking about IOT sort</font>

311
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,410
of from the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> level approach when I</font>

312
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,350
talk from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other angle the other</font>

313
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,959
angle being from the user end I Ortiz

314
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,400
been around in way too<font color="#E5E5E5"> many places now</font>

315
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,810
but what are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prominent</font>

316
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,640
applications I want to talk in this

317
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,420
section about some of the common<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

318
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,210
that are around here's a brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary</font>

319
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the applications</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see most</font>

320
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:49,370
commonly around manufacturing they're

321
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,690
mostly focusing on supply side up one of

322
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,660
the big trouble that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

323
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,820
manufacturing sort of at least the

324
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,930
supply side chain people have had part

325
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason a lot of them turned to</font>

326
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,040
Yammer and so on was keeping track of

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,230
inventory stuff coming in they can't

328
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,120
keep track of it in time and what's

329
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,340
needed what's in transit and so on

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,650
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying to get big on IOT</font>

331
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,570
and RFID chips and so on to make sure

332
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,430
that the supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and manufacturing</font>

333
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,980
process goes as smoothly as possible

334
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,680
they don't waste a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it um</font>

335
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,330
health care big<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

336
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,780
I you know also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had spent a little bit</font>

337
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,790
our time on electronical records

338
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,910
electronic health records any of you

339
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,699
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fitbit any of those devices you</font>

340
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,500
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our yeah thank you yet those</font>

341
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,840
devices you know are innocent

342
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,690
constructing a similar sense a Fitbit

343
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,240
alone is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I OT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a component of it</font>

344
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,430
because that Fitbit connecting to your

345
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,830
laptop connected to your phone going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

346
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,109
the cloud one day you can imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,120
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sensitive bits made</font>

348
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,940
that can track hardware motor<font color="#CCCCCC"> library</font>

349
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,180
you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data being piped</font>

350
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,070
directly to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> physician or as some</font>

351
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,170
sort of a monitoring server which will

352
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,360
notify<font color="#E5E5E5"> your physician in case your heart</font>

353
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:07,099
rate goes too high up that's the hope at

354
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,740
least um retail mostly these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

355
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,540
sort of the front end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the supply side</font>

356
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,940
you know they're mostly using it for

357
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,410
tracking and so on as well similar ideas

358
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,150
but here's something very interesting

359
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,270
that comes in retail and i'll talk about

360
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,430
it later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in more detail ibeacons if</font>

361
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,439
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have played with them there are</font>

362
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">some very cool principles you can apply</font>

363
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,870
from very using ibeacons as in

364
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,790
information sort of almost advertising

365
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,500
tools you walk round in a store your

366
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,990
phone gets a notification you pull it

367
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,160
out check what's going on oh wow so

368
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,390
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here you know</font>

369
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,980
they could tell you about a sale that's

370
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">not their only if you have your phone</font>

371
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do it you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

372
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,230
augmented reality games and so on even

373
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that that's part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the thing that</font>

374
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,500
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> for at least security</font>

375
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,810
biometrics is becoming a huge deal in

376
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,300
IOT so using your fingerprint to unlock

377
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,739
device and not only do that but also

378
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,229
authenticate it to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

379
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,880
network so in an enterprise in an

380
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,400
enterprise environment you're talking

381
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,589
about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could connect right</font>

382
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,240
away and open you up to you know it

383
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,220
could also authenticate your email and

384
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on and so forth all four or five</font>

385
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,360
different things through your

386
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,000
fingerprinting finally transportation

387
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:21,560
this is a big one because it's becoming

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,230
very very practical Google's doing

389
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,489
self-driving cars Apple is participating

390
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,810
in it they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

391
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,920
it and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

392
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out yet uber and lyft or trying</font>

393
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,890
excuse me they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

394
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,430
automated cars that you know

395
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,439
self-driving cars of GM and just

396
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,719
partnered with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lift and they're rolling</font>

397
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">out their first sort of batch of these</font>

398
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,700
in 2018 I I believe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

399
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,360
exciting because you can imagine up you

400
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,620
know not

401
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,470
these self-driving cars are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

402
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,360
amazing but the fact that you could also

403
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,060
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same sort of ride sharing and</font>

404
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,130
all those features<font color="#E5E5E5"> built into the device</font>

405
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would probably be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty exciting</font>

406
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:05,000
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do let's go into a few of these</font>

407
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">areas in sort of more detail and see how</font>

408
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,240
they work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I briefly talked about</font>

409
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole idea earlier of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

410
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,680
being a being of importance especially

411
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,319
because a lot of money is going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

412
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,560
area you know there are three sort of

413
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,410
these components<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a triangle that the</font>

414
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,729
pairs which are people actually you know

415
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,709
are paying for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

416
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,480
treatments the providers that your

417
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,189
insurance plans are so on and the

418
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,410
patients were actually you know getting

419
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the treatment very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often these three are</font>

420
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in sync to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea of how</font>

421
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,579
bad it is three trillion dollars are

422
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,910
spent each year in<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare and about</font>

423
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,439
a trillion of it is completely wasted so

424
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,140
if there's a lot of incentive here to

425
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,370
save any money from that trillion by

426
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,730
incorporating new technologies

427
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,199
experimental technologies like IOT

428
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,360
sensors are becoming very very important

429
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,870
big deal like I said Fitbit being an

430
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,250
example pebble they<font color="#E5E5E5"> release their health</font>

431
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,620
you know step tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and health API</font>

432
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,660
Apple watch has a couple of fitness

433
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,520
initiatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sensors are becoming</font>

434
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,500
important because these devices do one

435
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,660
thing very variable which is track what

436
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,849
they're given to do and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

437
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,650
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk in a smart way you might</font>

438
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:19,069
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting going on</font>

439
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,049
where you can sort of automate your own

440
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,030
life or your own health in that manner

441
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:26,510
so you can imagine sensors providing

442
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,709
data that can be accessed easily out you

443
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,390
know through like a REST API or

444
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,280
something and then an application

445
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,770
building on top of it where you can do

446
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,480
more fun things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's kind of</font>

447
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,260
where healthcare is going at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

448
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,929
seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way we talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

449
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">ibeacons I talked about them earlier the</font>

450
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,400
main idea here again being you can use

451
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,350
them in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you couldn't</font>

452
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,299
otherwise for example proximity

453
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">marketing I saw an application if this</font>

454
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,020
happened it's very very closing the lab

455
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,120
so it wasn't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the environment</font>

456
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,980
outside what was interesting was you

457
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,530
could see you walked around with it and

458
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,800
if you were in close<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to it you</font>

459
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,300
could

460
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,090
see an ad or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a sale or</font>

461
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that of the item being on</font>

462
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,810
the shelf and it was it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

463
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,910
amazing was all I needed to do was walk

464
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,649
past it and I got a notification on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,020
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty amazing instead of</font>

466
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,310
having to look around to each of the you

467

<font color="#CCCCCC">know through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the shelves or through</font>

468
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,790
flyers or anything you just get the

469
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,149
notification automatically which i think

470
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,550
is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty cool thing context</font>

471
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,470
is also a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

472
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,240
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> shopping it could recommend</font>

473
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,810
more things it's kind of like an Amazon

474
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,520
you know you might also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing where</font>

475
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,919
you can buy more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right off of</font>

based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your recommendation and that</font>

477
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,810
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of power to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stores or</font>

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,820
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who are putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

479
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,919
items up because they simply need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

480
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,960
program the ibeacon to take some

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,700
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and provide it to your phone</font>

482
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,890
it that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

483
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,450
simple and straightforward the cloud

484
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,640
that actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the processing of</font>

485
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,940
making recommendations and so on but

486
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">again seamless and very very easy</font>

487
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you don't even have to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:08,270
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that this has been one of</font>

489
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the largest sort of drivers of IOT which</font>

490
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,170
is home automation you guys but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

491
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if nest and in the you know</font>

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,730
automated control light bulbs and more

493
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:27,350
importantly belkin's which you know you

494
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:30,800
can contribute now now what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

495
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can imagine your your coffee</font>

maker doesn't have internet Wi-Fi on it

497
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:40,639
it shouldn't now now if you cut you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

498
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,000
either just build a new coffee maker

499
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wi-Fi or you could build</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has Wi-Fi but it turns</font>

501
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,919
the coffee maker on and off the reality

502
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,750
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that instead of building</font>

503
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,450
instead of phasing out old devices and

504
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,160
making smart devices all over again you

505
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,200
can just control access to power that's

506
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,210
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you</font>

507
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,940
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the belkin has done really big on</font>

508
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,870
you can control the access to power and

509
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,820
that matters a whole lot more the next

510
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,790
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually getting a bit</font>

511
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,570
maybe perhaps more serious reason here

512
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,940
being

513
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,950
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

514
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,590
going in here and and this is

515
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,350
infrastructure up anybody here taking

516
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,269
the public bus I took the public bus for

517
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,320
four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years it's terrible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

518
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:32,360
yeah thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreeing a lot of the</font>

519
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,428
problem just<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out from not only</font>

520
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,750
miscommunication but also not knowing

521
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:38,090
where the buses not knowing what

522
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,950
anything is happening the whole idea of

523
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,168
smart infrastructure is to keep the

524
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">people using it and our people providing</font>

525
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:46,100
it on the same page the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here</font>

526
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,679
is if you can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that communication</font>

527
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,178
faster and seamless people be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

528
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,460
people who want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your service more</font>

529
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:55,009
I think a pretty reasonable assumption

530
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,179
is if I know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bus is coming I</font>

531
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,250
don't have to wait outside for two hours

532
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,159
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty happy right that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this how</font>

533
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,289
it used to happen not only is this kind

534
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,000
of stuff becoming more prevalent in

535
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,649
Japan it's kind of been kind of the

536
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,740
commonality from what I heard I've never

537
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:11,090
actually been<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to go but one</font>

538
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,320
of the coolest things they've done is

539
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,840
build these IOT sensors that work along

540
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,629
with raspberry PI's and they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave</font>

541
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,959
them in sort of a plot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of land somewhere</font>

542
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:26,240
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things can tweet if there's an</font>

543
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,789
earthquake happening so they can sense a

544
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,039
seismic motion and they can tweet if an

545
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,990
earthquake is forming or even close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

546
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,330
getting to dangerous levels and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

547
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,830
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public twitter feed anywhere at</font>

548
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,389
any time like that's a pretty neat

549
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,189
application nobody's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thought of</font>

550
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:42,709
kind of that kind of people have also

551
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,809
done some neat stuff where you have a

552
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,179
sensor that's connected to a plant it's

553
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,408
actually in the soil and then it sends

554
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message saying I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need water</font>

555
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:52,639
because the the plant Nina the soils

556
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,678
dried out and stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stuff</font>

557
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,418
is pretty neat that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> where hobby</font>

558
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,970
has sort of come in you have to realize

559
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,830
everybody who's interested IOT has to

560
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,419
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in from an angle so a lot of people</font>

561
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">come in from the health care angle</font>

562
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,139
people like me or academics government

563
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:07,850
is coming in from the infrastructure

564
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:10,219
angle obvious are coming in from

565
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,408
ibeacons are building this sort of DIY

566
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,450
home you know home devices which are all

567
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,100
of them are very neat and this is one of

568
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

569
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,969
teaching people how to code a lot of

570
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:21,620
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who know how to program well</font>

571
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,080
enough don't understand the basics of

572
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,399
networking not at a deep level but these

573
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,139
things are sort of forcing them to learn

574
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:28,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're not then there could</font>

575
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,139
be other trouble

576
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,480
now a lot of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

577
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">so far were small players let's talk</font>

578
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about big efforts and particularly going</font>

579
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,750
to focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> watson oracle and microsoft</font>

580
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,770
and what they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done because what</font>

581
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,390
they're doing is probably going to

582
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,940
change the game forever who saw watson

583
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,730
at the Jeopardy game and so on everybody

584
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,930
right probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I was a huge deal</font>

585
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,480
what's it also building cognitive

586
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,110
services there was a recent trend by

587
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,090
them would they call cognitive services

588
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,159
platform which is the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

589
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,250
offer machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning or deep learning</font>

590
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,290
tasks as a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can drag and drop</font>

591
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">them attach them in sort of a flowchart</font>

592
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,490
and all you need to do is provide data

593
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,290
and Watson will give you the output

594
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,000
there's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed up here just some</font>

595
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,860
of the services available but you can

596
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,600
imagine just dragging and dropping four

597
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,419
or five of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to build a pretty</font>

598
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,300
convincing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network pretty convincing at</font>

599
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,610
least task runner there but they're

600
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,409
building up this new entire

601
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,990
infrastructure actually with 38 new

602
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,460
services specifically for sensors

603
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,660
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very well with</font>

604
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,910
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Intel supported devices</font>

605
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,940
actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come out I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

606
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,550
mid-2016 unless it already has I'm not

607
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,830
too sure at the moment but basically the

608
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,800
idea they're being that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watson is going</font>

609
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,090
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to power a whole new world of</font>

610
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,070
devices and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the reason</font>

611
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,639
what's it matter so much is because they

612
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,189
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical sort of not only the</font>

613
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,930
resources but the expertise to do it

614
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,820
they have enough servers they have

615
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,640
enough all of that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needed</font>

616
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,990
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> power a very very good private</font>

617
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,490
network and obviously they're going to

618
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,500
charge you a fortune for it but that

619
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,450
aside the fact that they can do it very

620
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,280
convincingly that matters<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

621
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,690
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push it forward the</font>

622
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,639
fact that they have be enough resources

623
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,590
to make all those things happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

624
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ultimately push</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT further down</font>

625
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:24,889
because dragging and dropping you don't

626
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,100
need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time to put together sort</font>

627
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:31,730
of a first prototype on the enterprise

628
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,679
side is Oracle again don't worry I'm not

629
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,960
going to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole chart but what</font>

630
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,760
matters is again something convincing

631
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,390
that they've done which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually at</font>

632
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,200
the very bottom java powers a lot of

633
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,330
devices

634
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,100
even some embedded devices and so on

635
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,280
some of that's being phased out but in

636
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,929
any case it powers enough devices Oracle

637
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,629
they're now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is push out</font>

638
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,850
separate set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> API that can allow</font>

640
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,760

641
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,980
back process it in the cloud and then

642
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally let it do whatever you want to</font>

do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization what's important</font>

visibility you get in terms of not only

667
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,950
metrics but the data itself has been

668
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,040
exceptionally well in providing a lot of

669
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,020
new ways or angles to look at the same

670
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,850
data that you gathered that's really I

671
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,830
think what's been powering them that's

672
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,709
the big difference between Microsoft and

673
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,780
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> competitors so far on when you</font>

Microsoft servers or even embedded

684
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,140
devices away to other things so they

685
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,490
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of leverage in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

all the progress that's been made in

improvement and that being said let's

700
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:26,120
tear down IOT and see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

701
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now people have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how to</font>

702
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,669
secure the devices at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment there</font>

703
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,290
aren't any standard protocols simply

704
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,130
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't know how many new</font>

705
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:39,950
devices people are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with</font>

706
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,270
more importantly the thing this is kind

707
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second fact is kind of a sad</font>

708
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,420
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we can</font>

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,750
compress years and years of security

710
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,940
very fast and very very rapidly just

711
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,500
because some security policies worked in

712
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,480
one environment they think it will also

713
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,460
translate very easily to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'll</font>

714
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,460
personally say that it's been very hard

715
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:02,480
to translate even<font color="#E5E5E5"> small policies over</font>

716
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,220
and finally no one solution is going to

717
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,510
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure it on this is</font>

718
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,790
something a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts in the area</font>

719
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:11,450
agreed you cannot just go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

720
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,620
solution that will secure all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500</font>

721
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,300
devices connected to your private

722
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,040
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to happen you're</font>

723
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,990
going to need device level security as

724
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,639
opposed to cloud level security and

725
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,200
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that let's talk a brill</font>

726
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,740
quickly but what are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

727
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,900
challenges were facing number one

728
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,660
probably the biggest one too much data

729
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,220
being collected now it makes sense this

730
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the whole purpose of IOT you're</font>

731
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,330
supposed to collect more data but the

732
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is it's becoming too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much to</font>

733
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even know what the</font>

734
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,919
streams of data in putting our if you

735
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,170
don't know what where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stream wise</font>

736
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,170
you can't secure it as well or as easily

737
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,970
another thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know all</font>

738
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the use cases people can make whatever</font>

739
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,700
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make with IOT stuff they</font>

740
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,459
can use the hardware the software come

741
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,040
up with new software there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no sort of</font>

742
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,410
centralized repository where they all

743
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,700
can be managed for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Ruby</font>

744
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,440
gems or something you know the

745
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,740
centralized place everybody knows that's

746
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,750
where to go look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them here come</font>

747
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,830
pletely out in the wild it's hard to

748
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,050
secure something where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

749
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:19,820
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters or what goes around</font>

750
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:24,139
it lastly um the more devices you

751
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:26,659
connect the problem is the more security

752
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,970
flaws you're opening up every device if

753
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,070
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> one flaw and you connected 500</font>

754
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,590
devices you're probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

755
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,000
500 flaws given they're all different

756
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,550
that's probably not going to happen but

757
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,290
nonetheless the point is if you connect

758
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,270
a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices all with on</font>

759
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,678
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of infrastructure that</font>

760
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,900
are different from others<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're also</font>

761
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,640
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble managing each of</font>

762
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,200
those security flaws which becomes

763
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,410
exponentially difficult to manage it

764
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:57,230
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to do if you have</font>

765
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware or firmware issues or security</font>

766
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,820
issues that go that far deep god help

767
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,590
you at that point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's very hard</font>

768
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,050
to manage software level issues leave

769
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">alone something as problematic as a</font>

770
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">former security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue the other problem</font>

771
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,240
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people aren't understanding</font>

772
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,399
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define access level if you have</font>

773
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,010
predefined predefined environments that

774
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,410
can control how the access works that's

775
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,590
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you're at a stage where</font>

776
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how the access</font>

777
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,689
level is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be managed for users</font>

778
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:32,030
connecting to it you can't control that

779
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,520
um I actually worked on access level

780
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,290
controller wrote a grant to Google which

781
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,129
unfortunately didn't get funded but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

782
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,659
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it anyway later on the part of</font>

783
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,640
the grant was dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with autentico</font>

784
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,110
specially easier double authentication

785
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,790
and how you're going to manage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

786
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,550
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that work later on</font>

787
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,350
and lastly maintenance of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices</font>

788
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are connected a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

789
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,980
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update their computers leave</font>

790
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,780
alone update farm boys or things on

791
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,090
their router leave I know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

792
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">go on to sensors and so on nobody's</font>

793
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update them now the issue is</font>

794
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,120
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you still manage to keep those</font>

795
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,210
devices free from vulnerabilities if you

796
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,309
cannot manage even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most basic update</font>

797
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,290
procedures they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very hard</font>

798
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:16,250
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you what happens when</font>

799
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,750
people don't manage them this is one

800
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,910
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out very recently was</font>

801
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,679
huge which is this search engine called

802
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,510
children which actually gives you access

803
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,980
to

804
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,670
it's for free you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> even look it up</font>

805
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:31,670
you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to cameras that are</font>

806
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,140
out there and view<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the unprotected</font>

807
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,780
streams like you're doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

808
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,550
search this was huge and it made people

809
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,810
not only think about how bad the

810
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:44,270
security is amid some people close down

811
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">their their private clouds entirely I</font>

812
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,370
mean it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so bad that you know you</font>

813
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,500
could see this time we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in</font>

814
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,620
criminais ting and so on but anyway that

815
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,310
aside the real the real story here is

816
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:00,320
that some of these devices in the people

817
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,330
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users cannot be held</font>

818
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,820
completely accountable a shopkeeper is

819
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,949
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend 10 hours it's making</font>

820
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure the camera and the way the camera</font>

821
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:12,440
connects to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a recording</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device so on are</font>

822
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,750
secured with AES and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 13 character</font>

823
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,310
passphrase just not going to happen we

824
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,510
can find better mechanisms on our own

825
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,580
because if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't going to do it</font>

826
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,320
and this stuff keeps happening some of

827
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,600
this could spill over into very serious

828
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,280
matters as it happened in some health

829
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,830
care and have some hospitals and we'll

830
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,790
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in a little bit HP</font>

831
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:33,439
released<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their fortify</font>

832
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,470
on-demand initiative on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet of</font>

833
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,630
Things and this is what the report said

834
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:41,510
about 25 vulnerabilities per device and

835
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,760
they only examined I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 or 20 of</font>

836
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,920
those devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of the common</font>

837
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,960
points I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about here the one I</font>

838
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,700
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on particularly is a lack</font>

839
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,400
of credit you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport encryption</font>

840
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,630
basically what that means is two devices

841
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,210
that are talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other aren't</font>

842
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,610
you went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure a secure layer like</font>

843
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,960
SSL or HTTPS or anything they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

844
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,050
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and open anybody could</font>

845
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,180
intercept again if you think about

846
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:10,370
deeply but who really should fix this

847
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,900
not the developers or the consumers the

848
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,330
developers cannot secure everything

849
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,130
mistakes happen people don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

850
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about budget and project</font>

851
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,480
allocations not<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody is going to</font>

852
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,189
allocate every security feature in every

853
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
project what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

854
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,970
fundamentally different and more

855
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,800
importantly something ingrained that can

856
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:32,570
come from bottom up is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you divine design</font>

857
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,370
devices oh and obviously software

858
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,540
protection nobody updates their stuff my

859
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,679
laptop is not operated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

860
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,520
just kidding<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd updated yesterday</font>

861
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:44,250
before the talk this was another big

862
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,550
thing actually I came out recently with

863
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,440
Nissan their nissan leaf it's got

864
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,210
anybody followed try hunt on the blog

865
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys probably already seen this</font>

866
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,500
then yeah there are a lot of the stuff

867
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,600
what happened was basically you know

868
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,190
they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about vehicle control</font>

869
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,399
and they had a application<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a</font>

870
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,620
mobile application to do it a lot of the

871
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">data about the vehicle the point of the</font>

872
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,159
apples you get a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on how</font>

873
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,719
your car works it runs and so on and

874
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">even other features about it I'm not</font>

875
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,529
getting a too deep into it the problem

876
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:16,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be everything about</font>

877
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,260
the car was accessible through rest

878
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:22,050
api's even use a secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> key nothing it</font>

879
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,390
was very straightforward accessible and

880
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,160
it the the column on the right shows you

881
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,750
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them it turns</font>

882
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,449
out you could use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

883
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,360
variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the results that</font>

884
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:36,270
came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here plug them in back into the</font>

885
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,400
rest api and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> even deeper access the</font>

886
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,710
name was a person you could turn the car

887
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,240
on and off remotely um they<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled off</font>

888
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,220
the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right away after this</font>

889
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,899
came out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on them</font>

890
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,060
because they you know quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> save the</font>

891
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,620
world but you know damage already been

892
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,750
done this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one example of</font>

893
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,630
something at a massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale that</font>

894
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,090
happens if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not only the</font>

895
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:59,280
right policies but even a sort of the

896
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,140
design mind set on how to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> iot</font>

897
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,450
and again you cannot blame them for it

898
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,900
this is all far too new for everybody

899
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:13,830
including security people like me and

900
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:15,420
troy how to pound it finally get to

901
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,890
where I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this talk and what my</font>

902
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,170
contribution was I wanted to save<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

903
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:22,020
world you know protect all these devices

904
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,400
but that didn't happen soon enough I try

905
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,290
to take a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> angle to it which</font>

906
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,510
was as I mentioned earlier tractor

907
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,740
translate security policies and and so

908
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,980
on that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already been in place for</font>

909
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:35,160
years in big tools and big you know

910
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,930
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bring them down to sort of</font>

911
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,930
these normal play devices

912
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,270
first thing I worked on which happened

913
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to actually give some positive results</font>

914
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:53,120
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a make every connection count for</font>

915
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,740
money so<font color="#CCCCCC"> microtransactions by</font>

916
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,569
implementing smart contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and micro</font>

917
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,180
transactions what you really allow to do

918
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,190
is to devices cannot talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

919
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,680
unless they either pay up in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

920
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,420
resources or actual money<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

921
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,490
anything like that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of it being</font>

922
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,220
you could connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to devices very</font>

923
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,200
securely this way because a third device

924
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,240
trying to access it wouldn't one either

925
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,700
have the payment setup system<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up if</font>

926
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,529
it does it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to that</font>

927
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,230
easily get into your payment stuff if

928
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,790
you can get if an external device or

929
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,840
external hacker can get that easily into

930
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,380
your payment system you have other

931
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,660
problems in IOT but that aside adding

932
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:33,320
payments makes it very unlikely for

933
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,029
people to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of want to hijack and</font>

934
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,640
connect the same issue why you know

935
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,590
email spam that's one of the things

936
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminating spam was if</font>

937
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay a fee for every email</font>

938
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,549
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting applications in</font>

939
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,110
Bitcoin particularly has been if you

940
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,760
attach a small micro transaction to

941
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:52,220
every email<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sent you will eliminate</font>

942
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,290
spam because for spammers who sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

943
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,029
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails a day that transaction</font>

944
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,680
would add<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to far too much money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

945
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wouldn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost benefit you</font>

946
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,879
know the cost of sending it weighs far

947
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,320
outweighs the benefit they'll get

948
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">because nobody clicks on those links</font>

949
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">from you know Nigerian princess these</font>

950
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,260
days the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart contracts are nice</font>

951
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,649
because they're autonomous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> self</font>

952
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">executing but what that comes down to is</font>

953
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have two devices completely</font>

954
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,350
without a person monitoring them connect

955
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,200
to each other manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and even</font>

956
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:22,670
check up on what the status is that

957
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,589
could become powerful because if you

958
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,450
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a JSON leak like</font>

959
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the car stuff we had earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

960
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,230
there was a censored monitoring the

961
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,070
outflow of that information they could

962
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">have detected there was it was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">information coming out that somebody was</font>

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,370
accessing even if you can't stop it

965
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:42,410
knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens that that alone</font>

966
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big deal and this was the second</font>

967
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,920
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which was detecting up</font>

968
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,600
there can be a whole magnitude of

969
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,609
threats that come in either from inside

970
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,440
or outside for IOT instead of looking

971
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:58,339
and preventing threats from the outside

972
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,019
what is probably more reliable to do

973
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:02,730
arguably so what's more reliable is to

974
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:06,299
monitor once your device has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

975
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,039
compromised how it homes back that's the

976
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,349
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea behind extrusion detection</font>

977
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,769
how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that your devices are</font>

978
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:15,779
connecting from your software your

979
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,729
system outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the command and</font>

980
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">control servers if you can instead of</font>

981
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring for every third that's</font>

982
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,579
outside a better policy is to monitor

983
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:25,980
your own devices and every threat that

984
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,670
penetrates through the idea here being

985
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,650
if you can control how your devices

986
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:35,069
interact from inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you might be</font>

987
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,249
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eliminate completely how that</font>

988
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:40,558
can that that connection works so the

989
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:43,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of it being if you could manage</font>

990
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,660
how exactly your devices are

991
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:49,049
transmitting data outside you could

992
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:52,259
probably completely stop it one of the

993
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:54,839
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that verisign found in the later</font>

994
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:56,579
half of 2015 was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dita's activity</font>

995
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,038
had been some of the highest that it

996
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,569
ever had been in a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do a four or five year study</font>

998
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:05,670

ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could really bring down a</font>

1001
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:10,680
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1002
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,509
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices well enough if you had</font>

1003
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,669
policies in place instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protecting</font>

1004
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:16,380
from details from the outside for detox

1005
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,970
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really protect too much what</font>

1006
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is mitigate some other damage</font>

1007
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,868
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside out so that you can</font>

1008
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,328
isolate the system and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1009
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">your excuse me your devices are</font>

1010
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:33,930
protected well enough and finally the

1011
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,940
thing I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier which</font>

1012
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,499
is device and roll management this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1013
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,299
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

1014
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:41,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of security tools implemented like</font>

1015
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:44,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">selinux and so on but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools</font>

1016
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,549
aren't actually doing our or applicable

1017
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:51,988
to system level security the point of it

1018
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:53,579
being if you can manage an authenticator

1019
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,650
device if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

1020
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,640
connecting to your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be</font>

1021
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,190
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop some devices from</font>

1022
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,288
connecting to it this could also mean

1023
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,849
malicious sensors you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine it's</font>

1024
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,529
not too far-fetched to think somebody

1025
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,029
would design a sensor with some software

1026
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,440
on it that's supposed to instead of

1027
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:10,140
sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> in data</font>

1028
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,950
actually just taking data or worse off

1029
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,240
is providing wrong data that happens I

1030
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,220
mentioned earlier in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of Stuxnet</font>

1031
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,020
where the data being provided from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1032
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,509
nuclear centrifuges was all completely

1033
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,430
wrong to the engineer side the

1034
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,859
centrifuges were totally fine when in

1035
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:28,500
reality they were breaking down so that

1036
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,180
you know there you have a risk of very

1037
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,680
serious espionage I'm taking giving a

1038
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,020
very extreme example you're not going to

1039
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,790
find IOT ibeacons in in a nuclear

1040
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,069
reactor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the point of it being</font>

1041
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,259
that you know if you have a better idea

1042
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of who's connecting to your devices you</font>

1043
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:45,150
could probably do a very good job at

1044
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,549
maintaining them system policies are

1045
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,650
effective but to a certain end what

1046
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,890
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> matters is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device based roll</font>

1047
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,210
security use people not everybody should

1048
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,589
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to everything in an</font>

1049
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,359
enterprise environment you should limit

1050
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:59,609
the access and not only limit the access

1051
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,660
but more importantly make it so that

1052
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:06,540
their roles define how exactly they can

1053
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:09,029
connect and authenticate into two more

1054
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,160
services if you can have a very clear

1055
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,290
idea of that happening I think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1056
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,990
really be making you know strides

1057
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:20,790
towards securing these new<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1058
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:23,910
devices and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hoped I saved</font>

1059
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:25,859
the world not really look you know it's

1060
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,970
it's funny you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your insecurities</font>

1061
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,460
often you're fighting a losing battle

1062
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,589
you make things you hope they work and

1063
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,300
often they don't and you know and then

1064
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,799
you eat because the attacker attackers

1065
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,900
are come a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated or</font>

1066
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,670
something you missed entirely you know

1067
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,770
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work on anything hoping</font>

1068
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,560
that it would work<font color="#CCCCCC"> out very fast and</font>

1069
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,349
safely it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely blows out of</font>

00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">the window but yeah thank you so much</font>

1071
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:49,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">for coming by and that was all</font>

1072
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,000
if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes to ask any questions</font>

1073
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,660
please either come up or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it</font>

1074
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,020
from there up be happy to answer thank
