<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in many cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can even</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you some kind of give you</font>

56
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay of the land about those of the</font>

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,500
legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitfalls and and what to think</font>

58
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're doing a reverse</font>

59
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,109
engineering project or using the fruits

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,959
of reverse engineering to build new

61
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:55,569
things but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal advice and then so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you shouldn't</font>

63
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,899
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be specific to your issues</font>

64
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's that's a that's something</font>

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,909
different so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talking about</font>

66
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,379
here i'm talking about taking things

67
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:11,290
apart to find out how they work whether

68
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:14,970
that's hardware or software jailbreaking

69
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">devices getting rude on on on devices</font>

70
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,560
devices that you didn't build you know

71
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,379
third device that somebody else build

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,639
reprogramming things and and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

73
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,560
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big one is taking us to taking</font>

74
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,620
that taking that a step further is is

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,699
right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you writing a software</font>

76
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,230
that's compatible with things that

77
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">already exist out there in the world so</font>

78
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,179
so so writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an interface maybe</font>

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,459
maybe not necessarily an open interface

80
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,599
but but but building something<font color="#CCCCCC"> new that</font>

81
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,220
interacts with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that already</font>

82
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,478
exists and there's there's there's all

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,370
kind of examples with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure maybe</font>

84
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,299
you can give them doing this or what are

85
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,590
familiar with it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of</font>

86
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,590
things so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

87
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,449
this this is these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in general the</font>

88
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,560
things that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look</font>

89
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,530
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm going to go through</font>

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">these in a bit more detail that's you</font>

91
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,069
know on the thing that you reverse

92
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,388
engineering whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hardware or</font>

93
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:08,369
software do you own it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or do you have</font>

94
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">permission to reverse engineer it</font>

95
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,280

biggest concern here so I'm save that

for last and talk about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to navigate</font>

it but also what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to do to fix it</font>

116
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,890
first issue here and it gives the kind

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the simplest one is if your reverse</font>

many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here know remember a movie</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">from the early 1980s called war games</font>

during Matthew Broderick a lot of folks

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay up you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in 1986 after having</font>

seen or heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movie it</font>

128
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,390
freaked out a bunch of members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,840
not always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best written law so</font>

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,190
within that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the result was the Computer</font>

Fraud and Abuse Act which is still with

138
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:13,560
us it has a few parts and it's good sort

of all an attempt to define and capture

140

malicious hacking and there's a few

141

different parts but the relevant ones

142

are here or here it's you who ever

can be criminal this is the criminal or

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,560
and then there's an intermediate sense

288
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,940
just to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

289
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,060
second thing was necessity whether there

290
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,210
was there was no other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that it</font>

291
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:04,390
wasn't an open standard it was in a

292
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,640
sense they had to do that in order to

293
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:10,720
write games and and the third thing is

294
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was they were creating something</font>

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,400
new they hope the end goal here was was

296
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,960
right new games they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't so free</font>

297
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,430
riding on someone else's<font color="#CCCCCC"> work they were</font>

298
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,140
they were doing what

299
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,810
necessary in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring something</font>

300
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,520
else new into the world all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things</font>

301
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,449
matter this is then a similar thing

302
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,149
happened again but sort of reversing the

303
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,860
reversing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> size of the API here and</font>

304

305
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,980
this one got cut off a little bit but

306
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:43,390
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> premiere console one of the</font>

was fair use this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bit dangerous to generalize from here</font>

318
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,560
but but but there is a broad principle

319
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:27,060
that emerges with some some caveats

320
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,060
around the edges the brother is that

321
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,160
disassembling and looking at code and

322
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,930
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an intermediate sense to</font>

323
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,069
create a final product that is something

324
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:42,699
new and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is compatible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

325
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:46,450
original product is likely to be fair

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:52,209
use likely to be okay under copyright

327
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:54,880
now going all the way up to 2015 similar

328
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,910
case here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle brought against</font>

329
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,189

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:23,709
android OS was in a sense emulating the

is good and bad both I mean this is very

adaptable to new situations but it's

362
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,180
also kind of difficult to predict like

363
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,449
the outcome of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any given thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is four</font>

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,270
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the four so that's the</font>

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,200
purpose and<font color="#E5E5E5"> character of the use</font>

367
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,930
including whether it's commercial or

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonprofit and then the effective use</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're reverse engineering code how</font>

much copy codes in the final product if

382
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:32,750
almost none and that and that's key in

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,850
some in the Sega Genesis case there was

384

to

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a fair use if if you must use that</font>

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,270
yeah in order to make to make something

392

run

393
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:11,350
um it wasn't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mean it was it</font>

394
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:15,070
was more about the court went into this

395
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:19,659
sort of the the layout<font color="#CCCCCC"> of method</font>

396
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:22,629
function calls and secure suggested that

397
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,860
just sort of the blue of hierarchy of

398
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,060
method and function calls could be

399
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:33,280
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been subject to</font>

400

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,980
files they copied see header files quite

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,980
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but not implementation</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stick still an open question all right</font>

404
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,850
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are the</font>

405
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:54,010
takeaways i think it is it's it's how is

406
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:58,149
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use any any copy code in the</font>

final product the final new product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

408
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,700
you're copying in order as necessary in

410
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,830
avoid doing your own work and then

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,110
lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're starting to see this</font>

414
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,480
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we have to watch out</font>

415
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,040
for is is are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking security</font>

416
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,720
precautions during this process so that

<font color="#E5E5E5">save the trade secrets from the original</font>

418
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,230
or really the the the details that

you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from the reverse</font>

into account that's the copyright piece

425
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,410
the next the next piece I like I call it

426
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,950
the fine print lawyers would call it

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,909
ridiculous legal gobbledygook that we

431
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,889
see or get exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to every time we deal</font>

432
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,940
with digital products and software these

433
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,560
days there was a study a couple of years

434
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,530
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said that if we all actually</font>

00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,830
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read all of the legal terms that</font>

436
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,960
we

437
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,129
are exposed to and asked to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font>

438
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:21,370
a year it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take us three weeks</font>

439
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:23,679
morning tonight and which means it's

440
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,779
basically impossible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are trained to do it don't read every</font>

00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:35,260
one of those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

445
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible but when you want to reverse</font>

engineer something it is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

447
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">moments where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually do have to</font>

448
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,570
pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what terms you were</font>

449
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,059
presented with when and how and whether

450
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,649
you clicked the i agree button or how

451
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,879
those were those were presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

452
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:50,260
and the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they often</font>

453
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">have terms like this and I mean this is</font>

454
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is from the samsung</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> galaxy note but</font>

455
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,459
this is pretty standard for both

456
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,289
hardware and software right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

457
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,970
you've all seen this language out of the

458
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,360
corner of your eye at some point it says

459
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,279
uh you agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not and will</font>

460
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,549
not attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify prepare derivative</font>

461
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,169
works of reverse engineer the compile

462
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:13,600
disassembled or otherwise attempt to

463
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,580
create source code from from the

464
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,820
software yikes I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all the</font>

465
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:22,928
things we want to do right and if this

466
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see this pretty commonly this</font>

467
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:28,750
standing alone you know it's it's not a

468
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:32,350
law to contract at<font color="#E5E5E5"> most you know you may</font>

469
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,139
just be words so the question is what

470
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,668
effect does this have on you and in what

471
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,899
you want to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is good this</font>

472
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,250
is one of those talk to your lawyer

473
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,870
moments because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to vary</font>

474
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,700
the important thing is just to note

475
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:47,860
these things take a screenshot take a

476
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:52,690
you know download<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terms if it's on</font>

477
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">paper save the paper and note how you</font>

478
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,799
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got past it whether it</font>

479
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,260
was simply thrown up at you on a website

480
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,179
or whether you had to click a and I

481
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,090
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is another example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

482
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,260
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else that we do this is</font>

483
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,070
raises another wrinkle this one's from

484
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:12,730
the xbox 360 and it gets talking more

485
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,710
about networking but it says you can't

486
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">use unauthorized software hardware to</font>

487
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,700
access the services nor can you modify

488
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,490
an authorized device in any unauthorized

489
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,810
way through unauthorized repairs

490
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,380
unauthorized upgrades or

491
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,129
is downloads this is the sort of thing

492
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,620
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use to say okay you can</font>

493
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">modify you know or you have modified</font>

494
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,649
your console you can't connect to our

495
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,500
network with it anymore which is

496
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">something which is you know always going</font>

497
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:55,990
to add another wrinkle I'll get back to

498
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:59,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these may not matter that much if</font>

499
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,940
what you're doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering</font>

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">information for for study or for your</font>

502
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:13,220
breaking a contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't come to</font>

503
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,570
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> demand the your phone back I'm</font>

504
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,840
sure you definitely we're going to void

505
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:22,129
the warranty right but assuming you made

506
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,399
a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something you actually</font>

507
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:28,880
agreed to something which is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

508
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for your lawyer you may you</font>

509
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,740
know there's there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

510
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do about it unless two things</font>

511
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,910
or they're building a product from this

512
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,649
in which case you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

513
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do what you want to try to avoid</font>

514
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,970
these kind of things or there's this

515
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:47,270
weird case to get back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA and</font>

516
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,280
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen this is this is thankfully</font>

517
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,050
the courts are moving away from this but

518
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,850
there have been cases where people have

519
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,020
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> accused of violating the Computer</font>

520
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,250
Fraud and Abuse Act that's war games

521
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,780
because they violated the terms of

522
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:06,370
service which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy innocence and the</font>

523
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:11,420
court n and overzealous prosecutors

524
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:13,189
continue to bring this<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but the courts</font>

525
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,720
are moving away from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's</font>

526
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:20,030
a kind of the judge out in California

527
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a wry sense of humor said you know</font>

528
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,600
you talkin by violating the terms of

529
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,850
service on an online dating site and and

530
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,230
he said if you describe yourself as tall

531
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">dark and handsome when you were actually</font>

532
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:35,150
shortened homely you may may earn you a

533
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,889
handsome orange jumpsuit but he rejected

534
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,000
that and said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not what this</font>

535
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,440
does you can't turn

536
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,540
and violating the the fine print on a

537
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,430
digital hardware software into a crime

538
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,870
but that still<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets bit still comes up</font>

539
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,860
every once in a while so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

540
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,389
the king but we are we've been mostly

541
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,790
successful in moving a long way from

542
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but it's not good it's not totally</font>

543
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:05,960
gone sometimes you can avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> these terms</font>

544
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,850
by buying secondhand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always it's</font>

545
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's not a magic talisman it's</font>

546
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,209
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really have to check in</font>

547
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,060
every case but but but they're

548
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:17,660
definitely cases where it you know if

549
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:21,350
you buy something used you didn't click

550
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,880
the I agree and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you never actually</font>

551
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,540
entered a contract with the original

552
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:31,550
manufacturer or you know or anybody now

553
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:33,230
now that's right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a magic</font>

554
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,480
talisman and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> always work</font>

555
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you know so if you are if</font>

556
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,230
you're doing things<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

557
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,150
basically any work that you plan to

558
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,680
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with anyone else it's a good idea</font>

559
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get your ducks in a row and talk to a</font>

560
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,750
lawyer before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but you know before</font>

561
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">you attempt this but it's possibility</font>

562
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,550
and then i got i mentioned it before but

563
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:58,070
then even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if even if your use of a</font>

564
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:59,690
device or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of software yeah is</font>

565
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,970
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> violating one of those things if</font>

566
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:07,130
it's connecting to someone else's

567
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:10,940
network or a server then you may be

568
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:14,470
exceeding authorized access to that and

569
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,630
that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know raises another wrinkle</font>

570
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,980
so then finally the last assuming you've

already so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA the ownership</font>

575
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,420
print we get to this thing the Digital

Millennium Copyright Act which may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

577
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,160
the biggest obstacle here to reverse

578
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,889
engineering but but again you know not

579
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,490
not insurmountable and not you know we

580
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:51,670
were not a reason to lose all hope this

581
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:55,430
was passed in nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

582
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:57,320
it says no person shall circumvent a

00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,720
technological measure that effectively

584
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,980
controls access to a work protected by

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,230
copyright well what the hell does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

586
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,390
mean well it says it is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to it</font>

587
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,370
it is this that says what that means is

588
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">a measure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ordinary course of</font>

its operation requires the application

594
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:21,610
more illuminating we know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we</font>

595
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,409
know that this covers the encryption

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,790
this is this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">business model and we know this doesn't</font>

605
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:57,650
cover just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a label or an HTML tag that</font>

606
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,200
says please don't copy this it has to be

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">some it has to be something with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

608
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,940
as being that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

609
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,740
technical process and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a label</font>

610
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:18,230
or a legend even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's even if that</font>

611
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:21,470
that label is digital but still<font color="#CCCCCC"> the soap</font>

612
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:24,740
so what does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

613
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:30,110
question the big question where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMCA</font>

614
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:32,720
is does it stop us from doing things

615
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,679
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be leaked that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

616
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,350
otherwise or does it only apply when we

617
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,410
are circumventing access controls in

618
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:46,310
order to make illegal copies of

619
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:48,500
something or to help others make illegal

620
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:52,820
copies of something courts are going

621
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:57,400
both ways on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the tricky</font>

622
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,810
part so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I this is the early aughts</font>

623
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,310
lexmark actually this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is still</font>

624
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:04,940
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's been going on like like 15</font>

625
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">years the lexmark printers lexmark laser</font>

626
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,090
printers do a handshake with a chip that

627
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">lives in the toner cartridge and if they</font>

628
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,790
don't receive the right hand shake from

629
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,790
the chip and the toner cartridge the

630
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:20,180
printer won't run some folks who made

631
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,190
recycle they refurbished toner

632
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,840
cartridges so they refill them replace

633
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,770
the chip and and and sell them as as as

634
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">refurbished they wrote their own chip</font>

635
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:33,620
which emulates that handshake lexmark

636
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,740
sued them they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're circumventing</font>

637
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:45,159
and access control court said no that's

638
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay essentially they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font>

639
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer already owns both</font>

640
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,230
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so there's the again</font>

641
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's no unauthorized access</font>

642
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,140
there and then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similar case</font>

643
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,110
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a company that made</font>

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,140
do with copyright infringement you're

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're there's no we're not copying</font>

652
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,580
code here you're just making new remotes

653
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if there's no connection to</font>

copyright infringement then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

655
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,379
violating the DMCA either now

656
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately some courts went the other</font>

657
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,220
way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of similar to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

garage<font color="#E5E5E5"> door opener but in</font>

in context this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> World</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Warcraft you</font>

660
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:39,439
know a famous multiplayer online game

661
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:43,730
and a program called glider which

662
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,760
automated gameplay I think it again

663
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:49,220
reverse engineered the protocol by which

664
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,850
of the world of warcraft client talks to

665
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,980
the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and replayed some of those</font>

666
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,240
protocol actions to just I'm gonna make

667
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,770
your character walk around and gather

668
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,890
gold or something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do basic</font>

669
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:03,860
actions in this case the court said yeah

670
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know even if if this isn't really</font>

doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a separate thing</font>

673
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,299
you're breaking and access control your

674
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,940
circumventing reverse engineering and

675
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:19,309
access control and that itself is

676
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,760
illegal can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so when totally</font>

677
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:25,149
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way courts are split which is</font>

678
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,990
tricky right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what do you do</font>

679
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,299
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reverse engineer</font>

680
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,710
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new things if it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to involve breaking an access</font>

682
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,919
control there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's another way</font>

683
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,500
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which is this the the Library</font>

of Congress and the US Copyright Office

685

which is part of the Library of Congress

686
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:48,760
every three years does this rulemaking

687
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:51,020
proceeding where people can propose

688
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,600
things that are going to be exceptions

689
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,100
to this law and where things and it's

690
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,539
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're tough to get and you have</font>

691
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and we have to ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them again</font>

692
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:04,520
repeatedly every three years eff does

693
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,620
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ffs participated in this in most</font>

694
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:12,320
years the last rulemaking just finished

695
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:15,739
up past October it's tricky it's

696
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,500
expensive and it tends to end up with

697
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,150
pretty narrow exceptions we've gotten

698
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,450
some good ones and we've got some good

699
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:26,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones this time around this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a few</font>

700
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:28,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good but so uh</font>

701
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,370
jailbreak and routing modal mobile

702
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,559
devices this is really defined as

703
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,629
modifying the software on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobile</font>

704
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,480
device and and this used to be just

705
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,649
phones but we've got them to include

706
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,630
tablets and smart watches too so

707
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:44,870
basically anything running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

708

<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile OS as opposed to a desktop OS</font>

709
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,840
that's how we've that's how we've sorted

710
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:56,030
it out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time could modify it to run</font>

711
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:58,090
software of your choice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar</font>

712
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,320
thing for carrier unlocking so mom

713
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,540
assuming something you have the codes to

714
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,350
do it or configure them or configure

715
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:08,080
them out you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlock a mobile</font>

717
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,010
without this law getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way and</font>

718
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,679
then there's two more going to take

719
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,960
effect this October the one on vehicle

720
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,320
diagnosis repair and modification and

721
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,700
another one on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good faith security</font>

722
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,649
testing of various different kinds of

723
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:31,970
products when we propose the an

724
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,980
exception for vehicle repair the auto

725
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,780
industry was up in arms and we even

726
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:42,350
heard from<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Deere who wrote to the</font>

might pirate music on their tractors

730
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,320
unfortunately it actually takes a lot of

731
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,530
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and money to knock down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

733
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good but this is where we're at</font>

734
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:08,360
we're particularly excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,100

exemptions windows when those come

737
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:16,190
online because so you think those are

738
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:17,060
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> help provide protection for a</font>

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,870
look for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of independent</font>

740
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:24,199
repair and then for a lot of interesting

741
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:27,580
security work but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably this</font>

742
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:29,870
process is not sustainable there's a

743
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,040
bill introduced in Congress it's called

744
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,330
the unlocking technology act of 2015

745
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,949
it'll expire at the end of this year but

746
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,750
hope but we're pretty sure it'll be

747
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:43,939
it'll be introduced again and when the

748
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:45,710
new Congress comes in next year and this

749
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,360
is that what this what this law will do

750
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,850
is it'll basically go take us back to

751
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the toner cartridges and the garage</font>

and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">help us get there the Copyright Office</font>

April first if you go to this website

763
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:27,629
there's instructions on how to on how to

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:30,500
do it you can send you can send just

there April first just giving your

768
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,200
opinion is great though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

769
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">really valuable thing is if you if you</font>

770
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,020
have anecdotes remember this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is public</font>

771
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,190
records so you know probably best not to

772
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,400
tell them if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think you've broken the</font>

773
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:53,340
law or doing anything questionable but

774
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,340
if you have personal stories about the

775
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:02,250
importance of security testing repair

776
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:05,430
reverse engineering and how it might be

777
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,960
impacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the DMCA and you can give</font>

778
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,368
attic goats about that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll</font>

779
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,350
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really powerful for these guys</font>

780
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,670
because we are continuing to pursue this

781
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:17,339
and again I'll make a shameless plug

782
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:20,640
here for donations to eff we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font>

783
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,840
us working working every day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

784
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a major priority this year</font>

785
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,780
try to try to fix this law try to remove

786
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:32,879
this Clyde this cloud of legal

787
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,140
uncertainty over security research I'll

788
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up here this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the</font>

789
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,190
the the points that i mentioned that

790
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,750
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier the things to think</font>

791
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,250
about before you start a reverse

792
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:46,350
engineering process and happy to take

793
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,420
questions remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't give a</font>

794
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:53,240
specific legal advice but I concert' but

795
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:56,070
I can certainly try to cali uh what

796
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,569
experiences others have had and and and

797
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,810
hopefully clarify some of the things

798
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,810
here

799
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,910
fire

800
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,120
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question i'm actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

801
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,250
sure it was asking if there are cases

802
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:41,700
about using digital forensics as as

803
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:41,700
evidence in a in a court<font color="#CCCCCC"> case yeah i</font>

804
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,319
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if there are any cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

805
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,180
touch on the DMCA there are cases about

806
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,340
fair use because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that you</font>

807
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it basically you can't call</font>

808
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,190
copyright infringement because somebody

809
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,640
made a copy of something to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

810
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:10,390
court case so that's so that's a that's

811
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:18,069
a start there for the most part you know

812
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's expert expert witness</font>

813
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:24,360
information it has to be reliable has to

814
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:38,710
be a useful based on reliable methods

815
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:42,460
yeah I haven't either not on the DMCA i

816
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:45,730
miss you discover the locker room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

817
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,280
heard that some of life in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DMCA are</font>

818
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,890
about the three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that exemption for</font>

819
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,140
security testing I approved it some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

820
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security tools for the lost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

821
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,500
arrangement in which day I guess they're

822
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,240
currently reviewing i guess most recent

823
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:04,090
news about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it those were under fire so</font>

824
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,390
if if<font color="#E5E5E5"> security testing isn't allowed but</font>

825
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:10,300
that was her ring<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Rick do we not find</font>

826
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:16,230
ourselves to catch 22 where the tool you

827
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:19,860
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> duties things but you can do that</font>

828
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:22,750
yes we do find ourselves in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch-22</font>

829
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:25,150
the good news is the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government has</font>

830
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,700
basically rejected that that piece of

831
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wasn't our agreement the the</font>

832
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:35,730
uncertain news is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

833
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,730
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world is going to do yeah</font>

834
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,170
the first point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink have permission</font>

835
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:07,700
yeah you say what sort of permission is

836
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,370
that your mileage may vary the easiest

837
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:16,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing the easy question is going to be</font>

838
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:17,810
if you own the thing beyond that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

839
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,700
know if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are concerned</font>

840
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:23,870
then you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to a</font>

841
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:26,830
lawyer this is the best answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

842
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,830
give the trans-pacific partnership

843
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:34,339
doesn't make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many changes to US law</font>

844
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,260
would not require that many changes to

845
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:41,260
US law<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it actually it's going to</font>

846
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,260
affect folks in other countries more

847
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,850
what what it could do and we're fighting

848
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,910
very hard against this is is it might

849
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:52,180
make it harder in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. to fix some</font>

850
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,180
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

851
00:40:54,609 --> 00:41:01,779
one of these problems might politically

852
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,359
set these in stone a little more

853
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:07,359
strongly both both here and in the other

854
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries but it wouldn't it wouldn't</font>

855
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:28,328
cause a lot of immediate changes in the

856
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:32,049
US where you try we are making

cloud-based SAT models or<font color="#CCCCCC"> rgrg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

858
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:38,829
you probably the better example being

859
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:41,890
office 365 I no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> own office for my</font>

860
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:44,710
organization as a curious asere common

861
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,920
what you think is going to happen in a

862
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,809
world where the legal firms are being

863
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,359
argued for at least one when

864
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:55,420
constructing the wrong or software

865
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:57,730
ownership plan do you own this thing

866
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,069
when the things i'm buying anymore have

867
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:02,200
specific clauses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't own them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

868
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:04,420
have a nice on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

869
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,390
ability to use them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

870
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:11,230
them so curious girl calm yeah things

871
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,848
get much harder not only do you not<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

872
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,380
it and that's typical right this is

873
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,869
going back to this is going back 30

874
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,519
years now that even when<font color="#CCCCCC"> software was</font>

875
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:22,170
was sold in little cardboard boxes

876
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:24,569
there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a text in the box that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

877
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,650
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually selling you anything</font>

878
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:27,849
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just giving you a right to use</font>

879
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,529
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not telling you anything</font>

880
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,670
except a cardboard box everything else

881
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:34,569
is at our sufferance that's not new

882
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,609
what's new is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even in</font>

883
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,589
possession of the bits writing

884
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:41,259
possession of the the object code is

885
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,720
running on Microsoft servers or what

886
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:47,160
have you that that that absolutely makes

887
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,160
these problems harder certainly

888
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:51,669
legalities aside it makes it harder to

889
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,499
audit the code it makes it harder to

890
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,369
audit what it's doing with your

891
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:56,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">information Oh</font>

892
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,220
seen any case wall or president coming

893
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:06,000
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially address that</font>

894
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:08,399
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're going to start to</font>

895
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,250
see it in the context of data breaches

896
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> corp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company liability for data</font>

897
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:19,290
breaches which it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible you know</font>

898
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:22,350
could lead to essentially do this you

899
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,690
know a software-as-a-service or you know

900
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,970
saw at least software or that kind of

901
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing maybe being being treated more</font>

902
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:32,759
like other kind of consumer goods<font color="#CCCCCC"> as far</font>

903
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,290
as if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it injures you or mangles</font>

904
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,750
your data then they're going to bear

905
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:40,050
some responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but that's</font>

906
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,340
but that's tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then and I'm SMS</font>

907
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,710
tricky how much how much time do I have

908
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,710
another another question yeah

909
00:43:51,160 --> 00:44:05,730
the nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have to ask my audience</font>

910
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:12,970
it's a given that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript chatter</font>

911
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:19,720
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a scent is all right there</font>

912
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they hire you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so your</font>

913
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:27,580
mileage may vary I don't know what's in

914
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:31,090
your employer agreements and couldn't

915
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:33,520
tell you about it here if I did but in

916
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:36,160
but in jet but it but but in general yes

917
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,800
those things can be understood they

918
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,790
don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be explicit</font>

919
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,790
yeah

920
00:44:43,329 --> 00:45:03,710
yeah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more where does one start I</font>

921
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,940
feel like that that's that's

922
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:15,859
specifically talking about like ships

923
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:18,890
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> irregularly here we see if</font>

924
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:20,569
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> brig if you come up after I got my</font>

925
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:24,770
god I can show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual language</font>

926
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:27,740
um it's it's it's broad enough to cover

927
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:30,589
that I mean and Tesla is the extreme as

928
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:34,279
far as as good being sort of a rolling

929
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:37,460
iphone but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but all</font>

930
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,280
cars all modern cars have have an

931
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">enormous amount of software and</font>

932
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,050
computing power and them and the

933
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,500
exemption was designed to cover most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

934
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:51,349
that with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exception of entertainment</font>

935
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,310
book audio visual stuff I can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

936
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:54,310
yeah
