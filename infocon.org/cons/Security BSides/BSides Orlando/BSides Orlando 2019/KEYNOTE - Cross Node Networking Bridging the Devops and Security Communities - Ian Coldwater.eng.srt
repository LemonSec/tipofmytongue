00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:07,020
so it is my distinct pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,219
to stage Ian Coldwater she is starting a

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,590
new gig at she'll tell you all about

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,259
which is pretty awesome and she is also

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,070
very involved in kubernetes a

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,750
troublemaker kennis a troublemaker

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,039
douche or would that be okay

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,930
she said troublemaker I gotta throw

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,930
something on to it so a troublemaker and

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,480
also helps with their runs the girls

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,130
taking over CTF team so again it is my

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,119
pleasure and please welcome to the stage

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,119
Ian Coldwater

[Music]

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:56,019
when does the oh my goodness hi

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:58,659
everybody hi um this is an amazing space

17
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:01,210
um can we just take a second before I

18
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,430
start to thank the organizers and the

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:10,090
amazing AV crew for putting this on

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:11,560
having us all here this is really

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,050
exciting and thank y'all so much for

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:22,350
being here - um hi everybody my name is

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:24,940
Ian Coldwater that thing is very big and

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,970
I'm an independent security consultant

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,250
from Minneapolis I'm independent for

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,780
another nine days and that I start my

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,369
new gig at Heroku which I'm really

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,190
excited about I'm gonna be pen testing

29
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,979
all the container infrastructure there

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,539
and one thing that I do is I travel

31
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,899
around the country and I speak a lot I

32
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,060
speak a lot - DevOps audiences about how

33
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,789
to secure their kubernetes installations

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,259
and I speak to security audiences about

35
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,810
how to break the devops people's

36
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,099
security installations and one of the

37
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,539
cool things about getting to do that is

38
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,770
that I get to talk to a lot of different

39
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,629
people from both of those communities

40
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,179
and I get to see the kinds of things

41
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:03,369
that they say about each other about

42
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:04,989
their pain points what their learnings

43
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,869
are what their understandings are like

44
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:09,670
you know what they're thinking and and

45
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,670
I've found some commonalities and some

46
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:15,099
differences so I wanted to take that sum

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,410
of knowledge and bring it to you and

48
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,299
talk about it and talk about how we can

49
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,299
come to work better together and

50
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,890
apparently I clicked this without

51
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,090
looking so what this is all about is

52
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,069
yeah like I said these communities have

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,750
common interests but they're not always

54
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,089
necessarily connected very well to one

55
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,090
another and this causes various kinds of

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,349
problems there's gaps in communication

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,129
gaps and knowledge gaps and

58
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,869
understanding and this creates both

59
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,980
interpersonal problems and problems in

60
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,049
the security of software and the

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,608
products that we build so let's talk

62
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,790
about how we got to this place what we

63
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,890
can do to move forward

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,239
so first things first just want to like

65
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,149
put some things on the table before we

66
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,360
go there everything that I'm saying is

67
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,430
pretty much the dichotomy

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,239
between DevOps and security is false it

69
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,400
has to be because it's all part of the

70
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,720
same pipeline right ideally we're all

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,459
working together we're all working

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,560
toward the same goals we want to build

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,970
more secure stuff I mean those of us who

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,860
want to break stuff like fair enough

75
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,099
but ideally that's what we want to be

76
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,049
doing and there's overlap there the

77
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,410
existence of deficit cops people like me

78
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:31,079
I'm you know proves that overlap and we

79
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,989
know that it shouldn't be this way so

80
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,720
there's that but the pain points are

81
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,370
real people have a hard time

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
communicating people don't understand

83
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,920
what's going on

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,410
this causes problems on either side of

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,660
the news cycle and I want to acknowledge

86
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,310
that these silos exist because

87
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,370
acknowledging a problem is the first

88
00:03:47,310 --> 00:04:00,569
thing first step to try to start to fix

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:04:04,049
it because silos are per grain and it

90
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,910
doesn't have to be this way I think we

91
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,980
can think about this as a security

92
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,810
vulnerability because it causes security

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,450
vulnerabilities so if we're naming this

94
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,289
one today and yes I realized that's not

95
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,668
a number um

96
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,630
let's figure out like let's treat it

97
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,858
like a vulnerability let's do it

98
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,310
analysis of it let's figure out how to

99
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,810
remediate it as security people how many

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,750
folks here have done a pen test either

101
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,090
extra-curricular ly or otherwise a few

102
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,950
of y'all a lot of us who work as pen

103
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,719
testers know that a lot of the stuff we

104
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,830
see in the wild isnt the sexy O'Day's

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,889
that we all really like to talk about

106
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,599
like those are fun but mostly what we

107
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,740
see is things like defaults and

108
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,919
misconfigurations

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,500
we see them a lot we see admin admin we

110
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,500
see people leaving their SMB one open we

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,930
see all these things and it's easy to

112
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,270
patch a bug in software you know like

113
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,440
you fix the code you know you patch in

114
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,049
whatever way makes sense in your

115
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,960
organization and then you're good you

116
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,370
know you're patched for the moment the

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
thing is that misconfigurations

118
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,120
are harder to patch because mixed

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,030
configurations don't come from bugs and

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,300
code they

121
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,090
from things like misunderstandings and

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,750
miscommunication and you can't patch

123
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:22,060
culture but you can improve it so let's

124
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,770
talk about how to do that first let's

125
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,300
talk about how they got here or how we

126
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,609
got here how did this class come to be

127
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,700
it's complicated right there's a

128
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,650
combination of factors and I'm probably

129
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:38,380
gonna miss some but let's talk about a

130
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:40,000
few let's talk about DevOps and I was

131
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,969
like this was ugly on a small screen so

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,150
it has to be real ugly on this big one

133
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,320
uh-huh so I come from DevOps I was with

134
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,960
that boss person before I write a

135
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,090
deficit cops before he went to security

136
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,280
DevOps we're amazing we do amazing

137
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,830
things we move as fast as we possibly

138
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,469
can we improve efficiency we you know

139
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,940
move everything forwards we manage to do

140
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,200
the jobs of 10 people because we

141
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,770
automate so much of it that we can

142
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:12,340
that's awesome we move fast we we get

143
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,229
stuff done that's great but the problem

144
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,260
is that moving fast isn't always

145
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:19,060
necessarily a good thing

146
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,159
security can be an afterthought or it

147
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,919
can be seen as a blocker is anyone here

148
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,530
in the red the Phoenix project couple

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,469
young so people who have read this

150
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,820
they're gonna have heard it before and

151
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:36,340
I'm gonna move this water not to the

152
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,860
back of this thing so the Phoenix

153
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,719
project is everybody hear me

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,780
sort of thinly veiled editorial this

155
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,540
guy's is a novel and in the Phoenix

156
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,830
project which is this allegory of

157
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,540
business that's kind of failing people

158
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,099
aren't getting along there's a lot of

159
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,050
like issues and silos between

160
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,760
development operations and nobody's

161
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,110
getting anything done eventually they

162
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,710
figure out how to get development and

163
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:02,140
operations to work together and

164
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,450
everybody that goes great everybody

165
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,610
lives happily ever after

166
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:10,030
except there's one villain in this book

167
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:13,090
and that villain is the security guy in

168
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,570
the company and he is the one character

169
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,880
who never gets redeemed at the end when

170
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,558
Devon ops become DevOps everybody works

171
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
together this is fantastic

172
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:25,329
the security guy is still widely

173
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,339
disliked still is often his silo in the

174
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,129
corner and as the other silos break down

175
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:31,239
that one stays intact

176
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,829
now the Phoenix project why I'm

177
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:35,619
mentioning this is considered one of the

178
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:37,479
sort of like seminal works of the

179
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,909
beginnings of the cultural idea of

180
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,378
DevOps people really like this when you

181
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,849
get your first DevOps job somebody gives

182
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,579
you a copy of the Phoenix project and

183
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,369
the fact that it's considered so

184
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,809
important which is historically it's

185
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:51,819
very important the fact that it is

186
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:54,489
important and the relationship with the

187
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:57,459
security person is so bad I think it's

188
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:59,169
like indicative of DevOps and Security's

189
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,179
relationship in a way that kind of sucks

190
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:05,649
you know like we don't actually like

191
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:09,339
want it to be like that and and you can

192
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,869
see this also in the way that people

193
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,959
communicate across teams in

194
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:15,279
organizations sometimes or even the ways

195
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:20,679
that like individuals communicator

196
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:22,449
communities communicate it's people if

197
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:25,599
security is seen as a blocker if they're

198
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,799
seen as the team of no it's um it

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,039
doesn't necessarily make people want to

200
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:32,438
work with us and if developers are like

201
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,419
we're just gonna like do all of our

202
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,039
features get our sprint done and then

203
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,598
throw it over the wall maybe they're not

204
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,889
throwing it over the wall to ops anymore

205
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,870
but as security maybe they're still

206
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,180
throwing it to us and that's a bummer on

207
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,160
our end to so we need to figure out how

208
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,359
to work better across teams and across

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,089
communities in our excitement in our

210
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,800
speed DevOps and I'm saying we here

211
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,899
because I come from there we can miss

212
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,550
things and we can fail to make our work

213
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,040
legible people don't necessarily

214
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,599
understand what we're doing and the lack

215
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,879
of transfer of knowledge can create

216
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,879
problems on any number of sides

217
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,479
Peach's lock is responsible for this

218
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,540
graphic thank you Pete

219
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,579
and you know DevOps shiny rainbow

220
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,889
unicorns sometimes can create problems

221
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:27,399
for security in our moving so quickly

222
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,010
and maybe not taking security into

223
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,250
consideration in the process the name of

224
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,230
the book that people get when they learn

225
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,000
kubernetes often is called kubernetes up

226
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,060
and running kubernetes up and running is

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,410
a fantastic book and its name is kind of

228
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,268
like what it says on the tin it's

229
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,529
getting it done it's getting it you know

230
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,980
getting it open getting your cluster

231
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,889
spun up and the defaults are pretty open

232
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,940
and it's open because you know you want

233
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,079
you want to get up and running you want

234
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,899
to get going you want to get your thing

235
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,550
on but then you can look on show Dan and

236
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,829
you can see a lot of the sort of results

237
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,430
of that of like leaving open defaults to

238
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,540
just like get it done fast and yeah you

239
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,170
get it done but you don't necessarily

240
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,180
get it secured and if you don't secure

241
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,849
it when you're making it it becomes a

242
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,649
lot harder to add security later rather

243
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,649
than building security into the process

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:28,649
some would argue that some knowledge

245
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,209
didn't get transferred to DevOps either

246
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:34,120
so if DevOps is failing to communicate

247
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,029
what we're doing to security folks and

248
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,529
being you know moving so quickly getting

249
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,209
this stuff done that security is really

250
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:44,079
struggling to keep up which sometimes it

251
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:46,089
is but maybe security folks haven't

252
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,969
necessarily been communicating our stuff

253
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,500
very well to DevOps either one thing

254
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,569
that I see a lot is a container person

255
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,120
is like people being like what do you

256
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,410
mean that's exposed to the Internet we

257
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,000
learned this as like lamp stack

258
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,860
developers in 2003

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,690
what is the deal I don't understand and

260
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,079
this comes from this there are reasons

261
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,760
for this a lot of like older school like

262
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,170
graybeard UNIX assignments who are

263
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,510
awesome for the older school graybeard

264
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,180
you Nexus admins in the room have a lot

265
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,829
of accumulated knowledge over time which

266
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,559
is really important and really useful

267
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,998
and some number

268
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,949
older school sucide mints have a lot of

269
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:26,889
feelings about DevOps for reasons that

270
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:30,519
are totally valid and haven't

271
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:33,099
necessarily communicated the sum total

272
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,819
of their accumulated knowledge to the

273
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:38,619
DevOps folks in their midst and DevOps

274
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,389
people in our enthusiasm in our

275
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:43,689
excitement and are moving quickly have

276
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,849
not necessarily taken he accumulated sum

277
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:48,429
of knowledge into account or put it into

278
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:51,789
our products and so on the one hand you

279
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,649
have you know people who are like really

280
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:56,859
excited moving really fast and on the

281
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,149
other hand we're not necessarily we're

282
00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:00,339
making the same mistakes over and over

283
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,719
but the people who have learned not to

284
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,519
make those mistakes aren't necessarily

285
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,989
telling the people who are continuing to

286
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,229
make those mistakes now there's

287
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:11,049
complaining which fair enough but also

288
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:13,419
isn't necessarily productive so one

289
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:16,329
thing we can do besides complain is try

290
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:21,839
to talk to the people who are creating

291
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:24,478
the security holes in the new software

292
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,519
and try to explain to them what we know

293
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:29,819
not by being like your stuffs insecure

294
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,099
this sucks

295
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:35,738
because who wants to hear that for one

296
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:39,489
thing it's a bummer you know like you

297
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:40,839
hear that your work is bad and for

298
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:45,309
another thing it's not really actionable

299
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:49,119
feedback like okay it's insecure what do

300
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:51,459
I do about it you know and being like

301
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:53,289
okay your stuffs insecure here's why

302
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,549
here's how you can fix it might be a

303
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,598
better way to try to communicate that

304
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,598
when we're communicating

305
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,040
because here's the thing that might be

306
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:12,529
happening to is InfoSec as a community

307
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,939
tends to have as I said also a lot of

308
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:18,319
some of accumulative knowledge but a lot

309
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:20,899
of the stuff that a lot of folks are

310
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,339
talking about still is not necessarily

311
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,749
reflective of a lot of the work that

312
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,579
like cloud native and DevOps and

313
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:27,800
container folks are doing and cloud

314
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:31,008
natives and DevOps and container folks

315
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,389
are doing really amazing stuff with new

316
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:36,709
tech like modern tech stacks are really

317
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:38,959
cool but what's happening is that

318
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,670
they're moving so quickly in terms of

319
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,969
what they're making that they're going

320
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,920
way up here and kind of InfoSec is kind

321
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,899
of going like that you know in learning

322
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,599
it much more slowly and a lot of time

323
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,029
this works fine actually until it

324
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,829
doesn't I was um I took who you're

325
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:59,629
taking the osep anybody view of young um

326
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:02,269
when I went through the osep lab like

327
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,459
classes I was like this is so old like

328
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,649
who works with this stuff like this is

329
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:11,000
ancient at one point I had to compile a

330
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:12,559
kernel from 2004 uh-huh and was kind of

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,670
scandalized by it until I started

332
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,920
working at InfoSec and realize that

333
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,149
InfoSec lives in 2010 um and and this is

334
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,620
okay kind of

335
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:27,740
because as pen testers we're still

336
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:30,439
dealing with XP but like it works until

337
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,750
it doesn't and when it doesn't this

338
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:34,870
becomes a problem like this this speed

339
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,839
of movement and there's increasingly

340
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,240
large divide with this trajectory means

341
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,910
that in the future InfoSec is in danger

342
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,920
of not having the knowledge that we need

343
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,620
to be able to secure modern software and

344
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,339
if security becomes irrelevant the

345
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,649
software become more secure I'm gonna

346
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,259
argue not I don't think so and so I

347
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:00,769
think it's on us as InfoSec to be

348
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:02,240
keeping up with what is happening in the

349
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,699
modern tech world with the new

350
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,319
technology with cloud with DevOps with

351
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,920
the really cool stuff that people are

352
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:11,569
coming up with

353
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,969
and as DevOps container cloud native

354
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,079
people it's on us to be explaining what

355
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,300
we're doing

356
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,529
because we're not always good at that

357
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,969
like at all

358
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:24,100
who here has ever written documentation

359
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:27,050
already really like five of you for real

360
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,540
okay so for anybody who's ever written

361
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,439
or read documentation sometimes it's

362
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,459
really bad

363
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,930
and sometimes it doesn't exist and a lot

364
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:39,380
of us are responsible for that writing

365
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,779
documentation isn't fun I get it

366
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,730
and in DevOps things move so quickly

367
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,649
that sometimes we just don't bother or

368
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,149
it's like already like as it's already

369
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,490
outdated by the time we written it and

370
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,660
so I just like to screw it but the thing

371
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,010
is if we're not explaining what we're

372
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,990
doing to people how are people gonna

373
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,250
know what we're doing and so if there

374
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,680
are DevOps people in the room it's

375
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,760
important it's important for us to like

376
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,649
be able to like make our work legible

377
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:11,209
like I said be able to explain what it

378
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:12,950
is that we're up to because and I think

379
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,529
that security is moving forward and it's

380
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,329
understanding of like DevOps and cloud

381
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:22,880
tech but it's pretty slow and and there

382
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:23,719
are some things that like I'll move

383
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,010
slides because you've been looking at

384
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,070
this one for a while security it's one

385
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,990
thing that is it happens with that is

386
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,920
that our understandings as security

387
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,290
people break with some modern tech

388
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,779
frameworks break our understandings of

389
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,579
how to patch things what a system looks

390
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,829
like how what a stable system looks like

391
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,199
how to fix it kind of break with a

392
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:50,540
ephemeral compute kind of break with

393
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,800
with containers with some of the ways

394
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,170
that kind of understandings of network

395
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,609
perimeter don't really make any sense in

396
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,740
a multi Club tenant environment which

397
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,920
everything is API based they don't they

398
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,829
just don't necessarily and if security

399
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,000
isn't taking our ideas our

400
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,069
understandings and our frameworks and

401
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,750
continuing to move them forward then

402
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:17,059
it's like just going to continue to not

403
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,619
work as well and we want to be able to

404
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,139
secure stuff so we need to be able to do

405
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,428
that so let's talk about the security

406
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,329
community for a minute because I talked

407
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:28,160
about DevOps so security people tends to

408
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,190
be a little more paranoid

409
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,050
and hip hop's people for pretty solid

410
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,780
reasons that most people tend to assume

411
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:40,669
good security people don't necessarily I

412
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,080
can't imagine why but that can affect

413
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,290
not only the ways that we approach

414
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,909
software where I gave this talk or a

415
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,280
version of this talk to an audience of

416
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,290
developers and suggested that maybe they

417
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,790
write evil user stories in there like

418
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,889
agile user stories that they have an

419
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,620
evil user persona for an attacker and

420
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,080
they just really blew their mind they

421
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,520
were like wow you know and I didn't

422
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,639
expect that to be the line that like

423
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,830
made the most impact but whatever works

424
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,720
a lot of them just it doesn't occur to

425
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,669
them to think about ways that things

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,680
could be misused and those of us who

427
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,210
misuse things for a living we get to

428
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,230
think about how things could get misused

429
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,730
a lot so like you know there's a little

430
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,920
bit of a difference there in mindset and

431
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,330
approach and that can not only affect

432
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,250
the way that we approach building things

433
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,620
but it can also affect the feel of

434
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,050
communities themselves because DevOps

435
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,030
people tend to be pretty open security

436
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,129
people not so much we tend to be pretty

437
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,580
insular we're really good about sharing

438
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,900
knowledge with each other but we're not

439
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,860
necessarily good about sharing knowledge

440
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,500
with other people and again this can

441
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,240
cause problems with knowledge transfer

442
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,480
also it can cause problems because

443
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:55,040
people security folks people think we're

444
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,250
jerks honestly they do it's a problem

445
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,000
and a lot of the time when I go to

446
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,460
DevOps conferences I hear things like I

447
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,360
wanted to work in security but I I don't

448
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,910
know how you work with those people

449
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,860
they're awful like they're so toxic

450
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,710
they're mean to each other they have no

451
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,770
manners like why I don't know how you do

452
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,800
it that's terrible we should all be

453
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,629
ashamed of that like because honestly

454
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,300
what I see of the security community is

455
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,300
that we're amazing we have so much

456
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,639
knowledge we do such cool stuff and like

457
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,830
and within the community people are

458
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,630
incredibly helpful to one another share

459
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,949
the knowledge that we have help people

460
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,080
learn help bring people up with us

461
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,020
that's super cool we need to do that

462
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,460
with other people too outside of the

463
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,270
security community and there's different

464
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,270
ways that we can do that

465
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,760
yeah

466
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,440
so people so on teams across

467
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,020
organizations what people see

468
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,450
so besides conference feedback is they

469
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,970
see us as blockers they see us as saying

470
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,590
no to their projects they see us not

471
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,850
being super nice about it again

472
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,000
like not necessarily giving actionable

473
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,830
feedback so they're like okay security

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,590
people I want to work with you in theory

475
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,580
but all you do is like poop on my stuff

476
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,899
and tell me my baby is ugly people

477
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,409
aren't necessarily super stoked about

478
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,270
that

479
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:24,290
so let's figure out how to talk to

480
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,780
people better and let's figure out or do

481
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,889
better cuz I know how we got this way

482
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,950
but it doesn't necessarily a good way to

483
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,770
be so if we know that this is a

484
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,510
vulnerability we understand how we got

485
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:41,030
here let's analyze it let's figure out

486
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:44,590
what this is getting us now what we've

487
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,590
got here is a failure to communicate

488
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,340
this has caused captain knowledge and

489
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,030
understanding on all sides all of us are

490
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,129
poorer for it these things have happened

491
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,350
for valid reasons without malicious

492
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:02,480
intent but they have happened and here

493
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:05,090
we are now so what is the impact of the

494
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,860
CVE like what happens if we leave this

495
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:14,419
unpatched out in the wild for one thing

496
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,020
bugs for another thing confusion there

497
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:20,480
was a CBE at the end of last year in

498
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,400
kubernetes that involved aggregated API

499
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,660
servers if anybody's curious as to the

500
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,710
deep dive I'm gonna be doing at a docker

501
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:31,010
con in a few weeks and the way that this

502
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,860
particular bug happened it was both a

503
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,110
local privilege escalation and a remote

504
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,790
code execution but security people were

505
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,379
super confused by this they were like

506
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,659
how is it possible for something to be

507
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,710
both remote code execution and local

508
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,790
privilege escalations that doesn't even

509
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:49,160
make any sense and it is possible

510
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,899
because of the way that aggregated API

511
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,600
servers in kubernetes work on the

512
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,340
backend and one way that some of this

513
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,350
confusion could have been mitigated

514
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,149
could have been by explaining to people

515
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,248
how kubernetes works on the back end

516
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,889
which clearly we didn't do very well

517
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:05,360
because people who are like really smart

518
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,850
people who clearly know what they're

519
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,279
doing we're confused that's on us as

520
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,889
DevOps people always container people we

521
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:16,779
weren't explaining things well and that

522
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:20,590
led to fallout it led to fallout of like

523
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:23,299
weirdness around disclosure and

524
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,499
confusion on the other end if we were

525
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,730
talking more on the other side of the

526
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:29,869
news cycle we could have done better

527
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:32,559
with that and what else does it cause it

528
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:35,119
causes less secure software for all if

529
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,668
when we don't come together those gaps

530
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,639
leave holes not only holes around

531
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,990
understanding that effect but holes and

532
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:44,719
understanding that create bugs before

533
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,049
hands that could have been avoided with

534
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,700
greater education and greater empathy

535
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,840
nobody wants that I don't think maybe

536
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,039
the black cats in the room want that

537
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:58,668
fair enough but I'm not a black cat so I

538
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:04,820
can't speak for y'all we can do better

539
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:06,830
it is possible and I have faith in us so

540
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,639
how can these flaws get remediated how

541
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:15,080
can we get there from here is the

542
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:16,729
deficit cops maybe the first time I gave

543
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,149
this talk I didn't actually use the word

544
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,559
data cups at all and somebody was like

545
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,489
obviously this talks about dead cops the

546
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,740
thing is that deficit cops is a

547
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,590
meaningless buzzword on top of another

548
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,799
meeting this buzzword if anybody has

549
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,090
tried to get a job doing DevOps one

550
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,158
thing you may discover is that DevOps

551
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,990
means completely different things to

552
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,879
completely different people and it's

553
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,340
really important if you are looking for

554
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:42,350
a diverse job to clarify exactly what it

555
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,379
is that people mean by that so do you

556
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,110
mean a glorified sysadmin do you mean a

557
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,639
glorified developer do you mean somebody

558
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,029
who plays with C ICD pipelines all day

559
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,758
long

560
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,559
literally what do you mean because

561
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,499
people have interpreted DevOps as being

562
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,090
around about tools and it's not it's

563
00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:00,440
about culture it's a framework of

564
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,879
understanding and a framework of working

565
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,220
together and desig ops which through

566
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:08,399
another little bit into into that set of

567
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,170
buzzwords

568
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,250
has also been interpreted to be around

569
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,110
tools about shifting left about putting

570
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,000
security things into your CIT pipeline

571
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,500
and that's great everybody should be

572
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,690
using that tooling people should be

573
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,900
shipping left which shifting left is the

574
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,400
idea of like thinking about the software

575
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,980
development lifecycle as I like a

576
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,510
holistic thing and then moving security

577
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,370
into it instead of having it be that

578
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,379
afterthought so that instead of throwing

579
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,399
it over the wall and having people deal

580
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,559
with the unicorn poop

581
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,600
everybody's working with like together

582
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,889
with this so those tools are really

583
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,780
important people should be using them

584
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,250
they're pretty cool but I don't think

585
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,260
that tooling is actually going to fix

586
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,429
the problems that we have here what's

587
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,160
going to fix the problems that we have

588
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:56,760
here is cultural change so let's talk

589
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,170
about how to do that we need to

590
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,450
communicate better I keep saying this

591
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,429
but it's true we need to engage with

592
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,860
each other more on this side of the news

593
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,559
cycle we need to reach out and we need

594
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,270
to get out of our bubbles so one way

595
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,320
that we could do that is by doing things

596
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,740
like speaking at each other's

597
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,629
conferences it's okay to talk about

598
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,370
security at non-security conferences and

599
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,170
in fact I'm gonna argue that it's more

600
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,580
than okay it's really needed because

601
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,800
people don't necessarily know how to do

602
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:27,120
this stuff all of us think that our

603
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:29,970
knowledge is is basic the things that we

604
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,760
do day to day are boring like that's not

605
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:36,120
going to be useful knowledge to anybody

606
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,830
else but it isn't basic to everybody it

607
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,320
probably isn't boring to everybody and

608
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:44,250
it really isn't stuff that everybody

609
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,600
knows and so if we are able to like talk

610
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,130
about these things that like maybe seem

611
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,928
simple to us they're not necessarily

612
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,550
gonna be simple to other folks I gave a

613
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,190
talk about basic cross-site scripting to

614
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,540
an audience of relatively junior

615
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,720
JavaScript developers at one point who

616
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,090
were totally mind blown about it they

617
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,250
were so excited and like all of us are

618
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,490
like you have a script alert one you

619
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,830
know but like it doesn't necessarily

620
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,600
things that people know and people need

621
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,399
to know that stuff because if they

622
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,780
literally aren't aware that exists how

623
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,290
are they going to prevent it in their

624
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,120
software probably not very easily so we

625
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,340
can speak at each other's cons get out

626
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,810
of our bubbles talk across teams more

627
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,389
within your org

628
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,770
talk to other people more just like as I

629
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:32,070
said we're in CL area security people

630
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:34,470
just try to get out more and and on the

631
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,669
DevOps end we can seem like container

632
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,430
folks can seem like they're speaking a

633
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,530
different language I hear a lot as a

634
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,230
kubernetes person like I say the word

635
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,879
kubernetes and my eyes glaze over I have

636
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,870
no idea what you're talking about it's

637
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,880
boring I don't get it and that's that's

638
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,260
on us we need to be explaining what

639
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,180
we're doing having people understand it

640
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,710
better and having it not look boring so

641
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,600
you know if we're explaining to people

642
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,630
better so that they're keeping up with

643
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,830
us this trajectory issue isn't

644
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,320
necessarily going to happen as much

645
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,429
maybe all the boats get to be lifted so

646
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,590
that we're all moving at the same speed

647
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:15,960
and that's ideal and security like I

648
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:19,230
said talk more with other people it's

649
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,220
important and be nice I got feedback at

650
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,870
one point that I wasn't telling

651
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,040
developers to be nice or DevOps people

652
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,729
to be nice so if there any of those in

653
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,920
the room y'all be nice to but security

654
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,780
we do have a reputation let's try to

655
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,880
transcend that cuz we're better than

656
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:38,490
that I know we are a scene SP so talking

657
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,810
about people thinking that their

658
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:44,370
knowledge is obvious I went and spoke it

659
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,169
like a few different conferences last

660
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,429
October and I flew straight from

661
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,050
velocity which is like an O'Reilly

662
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,440
conference about systems infrastructure

663
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,870
stuff to Derby con where I did different

664
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,400
versions of the same talk and at

665
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,580
velocity I had dinner with a bunch of

666
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,620
incredibly brilliant engineers and

667
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,840
somebody brought up Kali Linux and

668
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,260
nobody had heard of it anybody here

669
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,070
heard of Kali Linux a couple yo

670
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,360
everybody's giggling right because

671
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,129
that's like that seems like pretty basic

672
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,439
knowledge but like these people who are

673
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,240
like kubernetes rockstars like people

674
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,550
who just are doing incredible work I

675
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,690
never heard of it because they had no

676
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:24,240
need to like why would they care and and

677
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,160
I was talking to them about how I was

678
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,570
about to do this talk at Derby con which

679
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,860
was a to talk about how to attack

680
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,600
containers in a room of people who had

681
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,840
largely not heard about containers or

682
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,280
understand kubernetes and they were like

683
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,409
what do you mean they haven't they

684
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,330
understand kubernetes everybody

685
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,260
understands kubernetes like like what do

686
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,290
you mean haven't heard of that that

687
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,610
doesn't make any sense and and when I

688
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,230
went to Derby con I was like so I had

689
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,260
this conversation and they had never

690
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,250
heard of Kali everybody was like what

691
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,129
people have asked me the story is real

692
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,750
it's real but I think it's really

693
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,460
indicative of like yeah if you're

694
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,770
somebody who works with kubernetes every

695
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,970
day that's gonna be obvious knowledge to

696
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,740
you if there's somebody who works with

697
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,390
Kali every day that's gonna be obvious

698
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,390
knowledge to you but those things aren't

699
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,460
necessarily shared across these streams

700
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,980
so let's try to build these bridges and

701
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,240
cross those chasms because I think that

702
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,040
we can do that and I think that that

703
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,440
would help a lot it isn't that everybody

704
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,000
needs to have all of the knowledge but

705
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,010
if people have enough of the knowledge

706
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,230
to be able to understand what's going on

707
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:32,670
across teams I think that can really

708
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:34,410
help a lot all of us in improving

709
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,360
communication in improving these

710
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,120
cultures can bring what we're good at

711
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,070
because DevOps people have things that

712
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,840
were really good at security people have

713
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,659
things that were really good at so let's

714
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,060
take the best of these communities bring

715
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,670
them to each other and bring them to the

716
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,129
world because we can do that every

717
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,800
single person in this room has something

718
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,680
to teach and something to learn all of

719
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,649
us even you the person who doesn't think

720
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,290
you do and our communities are no

721
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,440
exception so let's take the best of what

722
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,909
we have to offer bring it together

723
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,900
combine it and work together to build

724
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,820
something better DevOps principles can

725
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,890
inspire us

726
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,679
DevOps as an idea as a cultural movement

727
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:22,160
is about breaking down silos is about

728
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,680
approaching with empathy is about

729
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,250
working together better instead of

730
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,020
building things over walls and creating

731
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,000
continuous improvement for all that's

732
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,330
awesome we can learn from that we can

733
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,240
have that inspire us and our enthusiasm

734
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,439
our desire to like to take things and

735
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,570
run with them to make things amazing

736
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,440
that's pretty awesome too I think we can

737
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,439
get inspired by that as well

738
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,639
security isn't a blocker Security's

739
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,840
integral I'm talking to an audience of

740
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:01,668
security people when so everybody knows

741
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:05,988
this but for real like our being able to

742
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:08,479
think like attackers makes it possible

743
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:12,499
to be able to build things with misuse

744
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:14,600
cases in mind our ability to understand

745
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:16,879
the ways that things can be broken to

746
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,399
find holes and things allows people to

747
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:21,439
be able to find those gaps and close

748
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:27,109
them that's awesome we should all feel

749
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,690
good about that and security we temper

750
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:32,029
things we make them stronger and so our

751
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:37,639
ability to do that can make all of us

752
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:39,249
stronger that's pretty cool and our

753
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:41,988
ability to think outside the box

754
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:46,669
it doesn't hurt for building things that

755
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:49,399
can be awesome either because at the end

756
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:52,489
of the day all of us are on the same

757
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:56,418
side we are the software development

758
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:58,039
lifecycle is one whole and I think most

759
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,139
of us again black hats in the room

760
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,408
accepted wants software to be more

761
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:05,899
secure so like if we think of ourselves

762
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:07,399
as being on the same team as moving

763
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:10,789
toward the same goals and act

764
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:13,219
accordingly we can really we can go far

765
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:21,519
in changing the culture and that starts

766
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:24,289
with every one of us because together

767
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:29,210
what we build become stronger and

768
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:31,070
together we become stronger and building

769
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,869
better relationships is the first way to

770
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,678
do that as I said this starts with all

771
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:38,779
of us how can we do that one way that we

772
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,789
can do that is approach the people on

773
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:42,739
other teams just the individuals that

774
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:45,859
we're talking to in the room everybody

775
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:48,739
with empathy where are they coming from

776
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,449
why are they being like that you know

777
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:53,359
like what is their deal because most

778
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,070
people like developers and DevOps people

779
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,109
are not there to piss you off

780
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,668
security people they're there to get

781
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:00,139
through their sprint to get through

782
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:01,190
their day to build a thing hopefully

783
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,840
it's cool

784
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,019
but like you know they're just trying to

785
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,728
like do their thing and secure it and

786
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:09,619
DevOps and developer security people we

787
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:11,659
aren't there to make you sad yeah I

788
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,428
think like on your projects like

789
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:17,210
we're there to try to make your projects

790
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:18,739
more secure so if you just like approach

791
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,080
the person that you're talking to and

792
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:22,909
try to figure out like what their goals

793
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,389
are like what it is that they're going

794
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:28,429
for that can help in trying to figure

795
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:29,570
out like how to be able to work with

796
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:31,639
them because if you can figure out what

797
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,970
they want like what it is that they're

798
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:37,899
aiming for then you can figure out how

799
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,759
to be able to move forward with them and

800
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:42,678
so meet people where they are and then

801
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,940
bring them up with you if there's

802
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,409
knowledge that they're lacking that you

803
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,940
have help provide them with that

804
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:48,830
knowledge it doesn't mean you need to be

805
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,330
a full time teacher but it helps with

806
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,279
actionable feedback and it helps create

807
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,529
better understanding so that people

808
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,549
aren't miss configuring things or

809
00:33:54,529 --> 00:34:03,229
leaving holes in their stuff out of

810
00:33:55,549 --> 00:34:07,700
ignorance because that can happen we can

811
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:09,918
break down the walls together we can

812
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,339
come up with new paradigms we can change

813
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,049
the culture we right now are living in

814
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:16,699
and building a new technological world

815
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:18,109
that's amazing

816
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,118
we're doing things that humans have

817
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,299
never been able to see we're doing

818
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,000
things that like people you know a

819
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:27,949
hundred fifty twenty ten five years ago

820
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,539
couldn't have dreamed of that's awesome

821
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,089
we should all be excited about that and

822
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:35,990
we should all conduct ourselves in a way

823
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:39,788
that's worthy of it because we're worthy
