always try to introduce myself so I'm

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,440
from a small town they call it a

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,390
warhorse town in Texas I live in Austin

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,910

33
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,610

35
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,660

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,030

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,170
get up I tell people usually when I come

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:50,740
to a room they play John Denver thank

39
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,080
God I'm a country boy so when I was

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,210
growing up my father wasn't there so I

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,689
never knew my dad growing up so I kind

42
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,580
of want to know who my dad was my dad he

43
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,070
lived in the Virgin Islands this is the

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,740
man my mom said was my dad and I really

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,990
didn't know so I grew up without him and

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,239
so for all I knew I didn't know any

47
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,049
siblings related to him or anything like

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:18,790
that so I wanted to the search and to

49
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:20,620
see who was my father so for a little

50
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,810
bit the US Navy was my father

51
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,450
the Navy kind of raised me kind of made

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,459
me a man taught me responsibility and

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,560
all kind of cool stuff I actually went

54
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,560
to boot camp here in Orlando back in the

55
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,459
day and they called it Disney they call

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
it Disney World

57
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,610
how many people we have any Navy people

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,880

59
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:47,709
Disney what was more like this that

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,690

I have a sister who lives here an area

63
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,360

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,300
and hanging out with her family so once

66
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,310
I joined the military the whole time I

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,230

68
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,140

72
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,330

78
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,500
you to come back drunk or married or

79
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,300
both so I came back married definitely

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,530
got drunk a couple of times eighteen

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,870
year old being over there able to drink

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,730
so this is my family I'm in the middle

83
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,220
with a huge beard somewhere in the

84
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,570
middle and to the left of me if you can

85
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,150

86
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,829
that's me my daughter and my wife my

87
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,430
wife I met her in Scotland so I came

88
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,440
back married and on the the left on this

89
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,320
side of the picture yeah right in the

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,120
left in the corner is my sister who was

91
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,609
kind of funny because I really didn't

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,860
know she was my sister she's my she's my

93
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,010
father I'm using father in parenthesis

94
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,510
quotes he definitely related to him

95
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,680
because she looked just like it but I'd

96
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,899
look nothing like my father so I went to

97
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,169
do a lot of testing how many people were

98
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,070
ever doing 23andme can we gonna hand up

99
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:29,890
how many people have heard of

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:34,330
ancestry.com ends up Jed match who's her

101
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,159
dad one person I figured he's Noah

102
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,030
Jackie

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,720
Jackie's probably already done

104
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:43,059
everything I'm finna say in my heritage

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,500
is another one so what's cool so I

106
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,880
actually got 23andme

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,590
I'm gonna talk a little bit about these

108
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,930
things so 23andme I actually did my DNA

109
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:58,479
test - excuse me

110
00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:01,810
23andme so on ancestry.com ancestry.com

111
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,880
is a really good place and I recommend

112
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,260
everybody check this up because it's

113
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,280
crazy what I love about ancestry.com you

114
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,830
can find out all kind

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,840
information about anybody a while ago

116
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,690
what I did is actually did research on

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,320
my whole family tree all the way back to

118
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,840
the 1800s and this is like like slavery

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,030
times right so some I traced I traced it

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
back all the way to like 1830 and it's

121
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,888
the forest back I could take it

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,620
personally

123
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,060
but some people know their DNA or know

124
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,370
their heritage is all the way back to

125
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,500
whatever land you went to so that's a

126
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,190
struggle like being black you don't know

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,139
because once it gets past 1800s slavery

128
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,870
happened and there was no not a lot of

129
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,910
good records keeping some people say

130
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,950
they have they can trace the boat that

131
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,710
their ancestor came on and then maybe

132
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,810
true in some cases but I really want to

133
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,419
know my family history so I went all-in

134
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,910
at ancestry.com but what's crazy about

135
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,500
ancestry.com is all the public records

136
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,870
that are available would be like a

137
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,320
social engineering dream for anybody in

138
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,440
here

139
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,510
you can find out everybody like I can

140
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,650
pick any random person in here and I can

141
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,650
know everything about you

142
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,940
like seriously on ancestry.com so

143
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,700
everybody you should go check that out

144
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,030
since I actually worked at NSA I don't

145
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,260
believe there's any secrets anyway but

146
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,179
but instructurecon would definitely make

147
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,310
you a believer I can find out anything

148
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,270
about anybody in this room right now see

149
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,700
that website 23andme is pretty dope it's

150
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,090
probably the most flashy flashy marketed

151
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,130
site and so I had a cell they had a sale

152
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,960
so I was like boom I want to find find

153
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,979
this stuff out and so what I was gonna

154
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,469
do is I was gonna secretly plot to take

155
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:50,800
my dad's DNA like I was gonna get his

156
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,550
hair or something of that nature or swab

157
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,320
him when you're sleeping and I was gonna

158
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,340
test him to see if he's really my father

159
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,530
because it's kind of an awkward

160
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,080
conversation hey I want to find out if

161
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,450
you're really my dad for anything about

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,770
23andme I heard I heard a statistic I

163
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,349
don't know if this is true or not but I

164
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,169
believe that 5% of the people that take

165
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:17,349
the test find out that that wasn't their

166
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:19,590
father 5% that's crazy that's a pretty

167
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,889
high number to me what do y'all think

168
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,929
in my heritage is a free as a

169
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,749
so these next two sites are pretty cool

170
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:30,460
because you can upload your data your

171
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,439
DNA data you can download it from

172
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,128
23andme and you can upload it see these

173
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,860
other sites

174
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,839
this Jade Mac site is pretty dope

175
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,550
because they have all kind of

176
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,499
researchers and scientists actually

177
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,020
putting in different algorithms and

178
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:47,379
things like that and you'll be able to

179
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,508
find relatives what's funny about this

180
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,149
is I noticed that everybody that uploads

181
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,919
their stuff to all these sites all the

182
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:57,039
people upload their stuff to all the

183
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,369
sites so I found relatives on 23andme I

184
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,378
found them on ancestry.com I found them

185
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:05,709
on jet match and I found them on Mount

186
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:08,339
my heritage so what's interesting about

187
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:11,110
this is since DNA your sequence is data

188
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,449
you can actually do some mining effort

189
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,879
to actually mine all these sites for all

190
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,339
kind of crazy people DNA and I'll show

191
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,610
you that later alright so let's get into

192
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,539
this

193
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,459
and I'm gonna get into some

194
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,619
controversial stuff and I hope y'all

195
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:27,189
y'all play along with me because it's

196
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:28,569
all love so here's Kendrick Lamar let's

197
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,629
talk about DNA a little bit more about

198
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:37,180
the DNA this is the DNA video that's

199
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:40,930
KDOT so when I did 23andme here's my

200
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:44,439
here's my relative matches I had 100

201
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:46,959
amino a something relatives on there

202
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:48,689
what's interesting about that is there's

203
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,939
not a lot of black people on these sites

204
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:54,699
so almost like almost all of those

205
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:59,230
people like like thousands probably a

206
00:08:54,699 --> 00:09:01,209
thousand people or Caucasian and again I

207
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,000
don't know anybody white in my family

208
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:06,130
and so I did this DNA stuff and I'm like

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,589
everybody's popping up I'm like wow this

210
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,959
is crazy like I got all these you know

211
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:14,410
these you know my wife's white but

212
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,300
nobody in my my my lineage that I never

213
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,480
knew that was white so it's kind of

214
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,979
funny because me since I'm a hacker what

215
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,600
I what I did is I actually looked up

216
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,769
everybody and I'll tell you about that I

217
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,949
actually started friending people

218
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:29,430
telling them I was their cousin and

219
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:32,680
everything like this that's crazy

220
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,959
so this blew my mind right here so I

221
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,000
didn't know any like I said I don't know

222
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,550
any your

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,570
listen I mean forefathers in my family

224
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,790
everybody you know is black my funny

225
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,070
enough that I remember growing up people

226
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,500
told me that I was far Mexican and since

227
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,230
I'm from Texas I believed it I was like

228
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,300
yeah I believe that

229
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:58,540
I wasn't however here I was part Y I

230
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,010
kinda had no clue we were part Indian or

231
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,199
whatever I think everybody thinks

232
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,020
they're part Indian in America and I

233
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,060
mean you know Native American right so I

234
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,660
didn't know what the heck I was but the

235
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:16,239
DNA test says I was 60s it says 60 I

236
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:19,660
mean 76.5 African and mostly Nigerian

237
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,160
and a Sierra Leone really so that was

238
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,709
kind of interesting and I was like cool

239
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,510
all right so I can kind of like no words

240
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,250
Yarger you know from a geography

241
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,800
perspective I can have someplace pass

242
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,990
you know the cotton pickin feels funny

243
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,050
enough my grandmother picked cotton and

244
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,540
all my uncles picked cotton so cotton

245
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,510
picking is not some thing that just went

246
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,490
away by the way it's kind of that's that

247
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,410
blows my mind that my my mom didn't pick

248
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,940
cotton because she was the baby girl but

249
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,980
if she was a boy she would have picked

250
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,380
cotton growing up and this is my mother

251
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,460
she's one of the 50s and they were still

252
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,910
picking cotton in Texas so European

253
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,710
descent

254
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm 22.5% Europe in that blew my mind

255
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,330
right and so what I had told my kids

256
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,710
because my kids oh we're talking about

257
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,930
they were by ratio they were half black

258
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:13,480
I said no your blackness has been

259
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:17,739
downgraded by at least 15% so they

260
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,210
didn't take that too nicely so it was it

261
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,040
was pretty interesting but what's dope

262
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,770
about that if you see the British and

263
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,630
Irish descent descent funny enough how

264
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,360
the universe of God or whatever y'all

265
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:31,180
believe in works is because the first

266
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,980
duty station I went to was Scotland that

267
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,680
blew my mind and I married a British

268
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,860
wife so I'm like wow that's crazy how

269
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,900
did all that stuff works huh and so

270
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,970
being in Scotland was it was dope

271
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,290
because I lived in Scotland and actually

272
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,940
I was having a conversation with

273
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,270
somebody that lived in Scotland as well

274
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,220
and I know Scotland up up up and down

275
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,959
my mother you know just like uh you know

276
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,480
a for father or somewhere to do it I've

277
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,760
been all over Scotland then all the cut

278
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,940
all the castles drunk all the whiskey

279
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,040
the hold on

280
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,070
so getting the JED match so so you get

281
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,910
your DNA you can download your DNA and

282
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,830
you can upload it to these sites this

283
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,079
what this is what blew my mind and what

284
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,899
I say this is a privacy nightmare and

285
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,390
what I did on here you see those KITT

286
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,700
numbers on the side you can actually

287
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,040
enumerate these KITT numbers on this

288
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,380
website this is dead match I haven't

289
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,969
done this because I'm a circle and I

290
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,589
would I would you would you should get

291
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,660
permission before you did anything too

292
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:34,990
crazy but I'm showing you here is a

293
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,300
screenshot of my results on the left is

294
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,580
a date as a kid and that kit number is

295
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,800
related to somebody's submission that

296
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,930
they submitted themselves you can

297
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,839
actually look at the kit by the way you

298
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:52,689
can look at all these people DNA is that

299
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:55,360
pretty cool is that craig grant what on

300
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,089
the right on the on this next column is

301
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,000
their full names you see me I'm MJ see

302
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,620
I'm being I'm doing legit research to

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,810
I'm not pretending I'm somebody else I'm

304
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,570
saying mark is that threat car.com I'm

305
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,459
like being real loud and proud of Who I

306
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:15,970
am all these people right here they have

307
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:17,949
their real names and so what I do the

308
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,040
hacker that I am I'm like looking up

309
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,510
everybody I can on social media and many

310
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,250
of those people like I said hey I'm I'm

311
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm your cousin how you doing you know

312
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,579
have you heard of this family name

313
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,490
because I'm trying to really search and

314
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm doing legit I'm gonna doing legit

315
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,060
research and at the same I'm doing legit

316
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,190
research on my family at the same time

317
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,770
since I found all this stuff is just

318
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,670
hanging out throw around and all their

319
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:50,170
email addresses so since you download

320
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:52,479
your DNA as a stack of data you can go

321
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:57,250
in and manipulate that DNA to match

322
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,380
anybody on this list so it's 100%

323
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,320
possible to go through her in mind this

324
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,200
whole website if you wanted to do

325
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,250
something crazy like

326
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,560
and here like I'm saying those are

327
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,230
thousands of overlaps so you see there

328
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,449
that red piece right there those are but

329
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,660
that's my DNA overlaps with what other

330
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,060
people so I think it's like really

331
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,699
really crazy that the DNA is out here

332
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,189
because what I believe is I believe DNA

333
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:28,250
is going to be what's what determines

334
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,260
somebody value in the future I believe

335
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,220
that everybody in here if you look at

336
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,750
like China China is kind of like showing

337
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,360
you a blueprint of what's gonna be

338
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,339
happen to next and I'm gonna give you a

339
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,980
couple examples of what we currently do

340
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:46,940
and what I believe DNA is probably gonna

341
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,350
be used for later and in the end the

342
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,660
whole point of this is like talking

343
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,480
about the privacy and how you can easily

344
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,430
harvest thousands of people's DNA right

345
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,139
now if you if you just wrote a simple

346
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,300
script so of course like I said I'm

347
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,459
hitting up people a couple of people

348
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,319
replies so I'm actually friends with

349
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:08,180
some of the people that I found on there

350
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,760
some people are doing crazy stuff like

351
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,010
somebody's a professor in Scotland and

352
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,360
all kind of crazy stuff and I'm like I'm

353
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,069
like really digging this so I got all

354
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,949
this new family all over the place and

355
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,949
it's funny because if I was a bad actor

356
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:22,760
people trust you because you share DNA

357
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:26,269
with them

358
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,819
it's the ultimate little card like we're

359
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:32,540
cousins man I wouldn't do anything to

360
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:39,890
you right we all know family is the

361
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:41,959
worst to do you over the worst right so

362
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,480
bringing me back to Vegas how many y'all

363
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,739
go to the Vegas conferences so when

364
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,329
y'all see when y'all see your brother

365
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,930
out in Vegas say hi

366
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:52,699
cuz I'm always there so say hi to me say

367
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,060
hi when I'm when I'm around I'm out here

368
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:58,310
I love meeting people I love seeing if

369
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,500
there's an opportunity for me to help

370
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,880
out if I can

371
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,310
so what's funny about Vegas every year

372
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,550
when I went to Vegas I would go and and

373
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:12,170
and visit my dad's aunt

374
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:15,290
which was kind of interesting so I you

375
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,610
know he was definitely my my dad looks

376
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,949
like my aunt

377
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,220
so it's the craziest thing so it's like

378
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,110
so they have strong so strong genetics

379
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,579
that they all look alike but I don't

380
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,579
look like them I look like my mom's side

381
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:30,609
so I still was unconvinced and so when I

382
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:33,410
did my DNA test I was telling my wife

383
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,810
man it is gonna be so awkward if these

384
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:40,189
people aren't related to me

385
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:42,380
can you imagine that so what I did my

386
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,860
when I got my DNA relatives they saw

387
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,490
23andme so the top one is because this

388
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,940
is my aunt

389
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,829
her name is Irma Johnson that's my dad's

390
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,800
the guy that I thought was my dad that's

391
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:57,979
his his aunt so that right there was

392
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,719
like oh snap he is my dad and it sucks

393
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,550
that I had to find out this way because

394
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,939
I was thinking of all these plots so I

395
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,428
can get his DNA if I can give my sister

396
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,169
tested like all kind of different I had

397
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,500
all these plots on how I was gonna solve

398
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:15,410
this problem but the problem solved

399
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,869
itself for me and when I noticed of with

400
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,270
with that is like you hear here

401
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,479
sometimes of things like this the crime

402
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,970
scene piece right so on the crime scene

403
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,799
you've heard about now people are

404
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,690
they're finding murderers and serial

405
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:34,490
killers through DNA right so sometimes I

406
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,049
have these thoughts in my head if I was

407
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,210
a cop how about I catch people I

408
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,650
actually took I think about if I was

409
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,900
still at the agency how would I be

410
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,570
catching some of these people - so I

411
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,020
kind of think of this and so I just

412
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,629
showed you real quick that a lot of

413
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,030
these DNA testing sites are under like

414
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:57,350
hard water because what they're doing is

415
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,649
a they're agreeing to cooperate with

416
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,990
crimes but I just showed you that the

417
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,740
people are just uploading in their DNA

418
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,770
to any website so if I was a cop or a

419
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,179
boss FBI or the CIA or NSA I would

420
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:16,760
create a fake DNA analysis site it let

421
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:18,020
everybody just let everybody upload

422
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,879
their DNA straight to me

423
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,860
and what's funny about this is because

424
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,190
the same technique has been used on like

425
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,899
pastebin sites so you know the

426
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,090
government makes all kind of crazy sites

427
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,630
for people that I've loved so I wouldn't

428
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,980
be surprised in the future there's a go

429
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,590
is gonna be maintaining this stuff

430
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,990
either sarin sarin what do you got Sara

431
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:42,470
tippling I'm from Texas so forgive my

432
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:45,809
you know you're not gonna know it so um

433
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,909
so what's happening here is that this

434
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,710
will definitely continue to work I know

435
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,600
in China they're actually doing all kind

436
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,490
of crazy facial recognition for

437
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,168
everybody I wouldn't be surprised if

438
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,809
China actually already hacked all these

439
00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:00,600
websites that I'm talking about and got

440
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:02,700
out and got all the people that gave

441
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,699
their DNA anyway I would not be

442
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,169
surprised and then I'm gonna talk about

443
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,909
a little bit more technology and what

444
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:14,929
I'm gonna talk about here is what we

445
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:17,340
find value what did we see value in so

446
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:19,019
the reason why I'm bringing this book up

447
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,970
is that this book actually taught me a

448
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,769
lot of stuff about empathy and how big

449
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,210
people have been different so right now

450
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,789
I think a lot of stuff in America

451
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,029
definitely in a lot even like in Asia of

452
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:33,600
one of my one of my employees is Asian

453
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:35,759
and she told me that she is funny

454
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,610
because she's not dark-skinned Asian to

455
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,929
me but to her she was dark-skinned Asian

456
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,729
and to every other agent she was

457
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,139
dark-skinned that's like you look real

458
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,929
light-skinned she's like no I'm I'm

459
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,008
actually quite dark and and she told me

460
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:53,159
in China the lighter you are the better

461
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:54,929
I'm like what that blew my mind she told

462
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,340
me that that if you were light that

463
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,529
meant you were royalty and didn't have

464
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,529
to work in the fields the people had

465
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:03,090
darker pigmentation in China she said

466
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:05,850
that they were they were view as a lower

467
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,220
caste or a lower class even has anybody

468
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,250
heard that that blew my mind I did not

469
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,889
know that that blew my mind and I'm like

470
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,480
well this is crazy like all these people

471
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,490
from different places and there's always

472
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,100
something and I'll talk about this

473
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,220
another book in a second where there's

474
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,090
always something in society that makes

475
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:30,330
you treat people better or worse right

476
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,830
and I believe again DNA is the future of

477
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,580
this and that's why I think we have to

478
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,918
start thinking and more serious so when

479
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,019
I start doing to myself that book that I

480
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,450
just mentioned it talks about checking

481
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,520
your privilege one of the things it

482
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,860
talks about so my privilege

483
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:51,270
it's funny because I never always

484
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,610
thought you know I'm black and I've been

485
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,530
you know the story of the slave trade

486
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,600
and all that stuff I'm gonna touch on

487
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,440
that a little bit but the truth is if I

488
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,050
look at myself

489
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,600
what what's cool about my privilege is I

490
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,500
was born in America that's a leg up on

491
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,080
most people in the world when I was 18 I

492
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,350
took a ASVAB test more on that later

493
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,830
and that ass Baptist I got and I got the

494
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,949
highest clearance in the land at 18 I

495
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,800
worked at NSA as a Blue badger for eight

496
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,450
years when I was 18 year old I had this

497
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,629
was in the when the internet was just

498
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,700
coming up I had access to tons and tons

499
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:35,310
of computers the military and NSA spent

500
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,130
$200,000 on training me so I'm like I'm

501
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:42,780
like a nerd boys a nerd version of Jason

502
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:45,630
Bourne and the Bourne Identity so like

503
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,879
that is crazy privileged I got my

504
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,700
bachelor's degree for free I got my

505
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,530
master's degree for free like if you

506
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,510
just took Marcus being black that's the

507
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,270
equation I got a whole lot of privilege

508
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,790
and so that's like man we're all we all

509
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,500
have some kind of privilege and this is

510
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,389
where it's got to get funny because the

511
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,000
people with the privilege to do crazy

512
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,950
stuff like CRISPR technology and stuff

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,430
like that where they're going in and are

514
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,900
modifying DNA they're going to be those

515
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,730
people that have money and that

516
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,440
privilege that to spend that money on

517
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,740
their kids and stuff before they even

518
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,490
born that's that's the future we're

519
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,890
living in right now also this book

520
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,250
sapiens have anybody seen this book

521
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,010
before read it read it a couple people

522
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,950
everybody should read this book this

523
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,600
book blew my mind what this book talks

524
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:41,520
about it talks about the history of

525
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,500
sapiens like us we're sapiens right but

526
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,610
also like the Neanderthal and other

527
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,560
different other different sapiens that

528
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,199
existed all at the same time a lot of

529
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,540
people don't know this but even some

530
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,220
people they have some people in her in

531
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,530
this room probably have a little bit of

532
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,440
Neanderthal DNA

533
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:05,660
so we were all here at the same time but

534
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,640
Homo sapiens killed everybody else Homo

535
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,850
sapiens also killed all the animals

536
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,460
everywhere they lived - and it taught it

537
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:17,300
makes all these ridiculous tires on how

538
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,680
people are bad and it's usually for and

539
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,960
it's a follow-up book to this it's

540
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,340
usually based on scarcity we always

541
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,170
think there are scarcity but there's

542
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,060
actually abundance we have more food

543
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,010
than ever we have more anything that

544
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,899
ever but some people are scared that we

545
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,420
don't have enough of something we have

546
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,910
more money food whatever lights

547
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:39,080
electricity whatever you talk about we

548
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:41,710
have more of it right now anybody heard

549
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,810
this guy can somebody tell what it says

550
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:51,530
I'm gonna give you a present if you was

551
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:53,810
this Lupe Fiasco this guy Lupe Fiasco is

552
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,620
what they call a conscious rapper so I

553
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,480
guess

554
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,610
Kendrick Lamar the other guy he's a

555
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,380
conscious rapper but sometimes these

556
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,070
rappers spit so much knowledge it's

557
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,280
ridiculous this is the this is the cover

558
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:16,370
of his album his last album anybody know

559
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:17,960
that is just blew my mind it took me

560
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,479
forever to figure out what this was so I

561
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,950
found it in a forum somewhere and that

562
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,490
is that so what this is called is this

563
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,280
call this is called a manila this was

564
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:34,030
used at trade slaves so this thing right

565
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,680
here was worth one slave

566
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,970
it's a tiny piece of copper or bronze

567
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,220
like tiny like this big but that was

568
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,130
used to trade one human body that's

569
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,690
crazy to me like that day but it was it

570
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,340
was valuable so what happened is the

571
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,710
Europeans will make these in factories

572
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,649
in Europe they would come down and buy

573
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,140
slaves for this and then in and trade

574
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,030
for this they kept the Africans kabak

575
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,330
guns so Africans sold each other in

576
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,580
slavery - right so the Africans used to

577
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,800
trade one of these for a gun so they can

578
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,199
actually go conquer more land grab more

579
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,240
slaves get more Manila get more guns and

580
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,910
it was shipped to slaves

581
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,280
America mostly I think 85% of the slave

582
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,590
trade went to South America and a tiny

583
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,330
fraction that went to North America why

584
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,370
this is important is because what we

585
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,090
view as value is it blows my mind

586
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,340
because now we have stuff like Bitcoin

587
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:32,059
and people place value and that stuff

588
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,620
now Bitcoin to me it's a made-up thing

589
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,850
might affect all our money right now

590
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,750
it's not backed by anything it's all

591
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,570
fiat currency even an American dollar

592
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,400
but it's crazy how we we we associate

593
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,260
value with all these things the talk of

594
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,080
this is I got royalty royalty

595
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,559
I got royalty and loyalty I think humans

596
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,320
by nature is loyal until money comes in

597
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,928
the picture I just heard today another

598
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,960
Bitcoin some kind of Bitcoin company

599
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:02,480
just got you know messed over I was like

600
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,130
13 million dollars um and so I think

601
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,740
that humans are good as long as money

602
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,080
not involved I think that about anything

603
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,760
you could you could talk about you talk

604
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,689
about the intelligence community same

605
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,210
thing here's how that here's how that

606
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,830
slave trade worked and what's

607
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,140
interesting about this is during that

608
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,870
time what people the people that have

609
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,090
money and power sometimes it was the

610
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,280
royalty sometimes it was the people they

611
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,050
had the money they were in control but

612
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,020
they controlled they control the slave

613
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,700
trade and a couple other things that did

614
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,760
y'all know that the slave trading boats

615
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,620
were on stock markets globally so you

616
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,080
could buy stock in the slave trade and

617
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,580
the slave companies and this was a

618
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:50,030
human's mess everything that were

619
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:51,740
terrible so we built this amazing

620
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,809
country I'm proud to be an American

621
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:58,970
definitely proud to be a Texan it's a

622
00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:01,250
whole nother country but what's crazy

623
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,020
though trafficking is still going on our

624
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,850
global scale and there's some tons and

625
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,660
tons billions of dollars being made I'm

626
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,309
still exploiting people it's just both

627
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,490
it blows my mind it's still happening

628
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:15,080
and if you could do anything to help

629
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,880
stop that there's plenty of organization

630
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,770
out there trying to help do this so this

631
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,179
is still happening today sometimes you

632
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,400
talk about slavery and all that stuff we

633
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,440
talked about oh yeah that must have

634
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,950
sucked like like it's way back in the

635
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,490
day

636
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,200
it's still happy to know also talking

637
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,529
about measuring let me let me go through

638
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,350
this

639
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:35,720
so the ASVAB test what it did for the

640
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,490
military is he said that Marcus it

641
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,320
identified Marcus Carey that's me I was

642
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,299
gonna be good at cryptography and stuff

643
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,490
like that

644
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:48,740
so they put me in that position to do

645
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,049
cryptography and that was my privilege

646
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,679
my privileges was I could I could take

647
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,899
test real good I'm a great test taker

648
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,529
right and so anybody heard of CLEP test

649
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:02,209
or whatever yeah so CLEP test is of

650
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,850
tested you can take for college credit I

651
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:08,630
did a hundred and fifteen credits like

652
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,820
college credits on CLEP tests I can take

653
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,820
tests better anybody in the world so if

654
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,769
there's a DNA segment that says this guy

655
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,539
is good at taking tests that's me

656
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:20,690
they need to clone that little that

657
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,309
little segment but but what I'm saying

658
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,649
is that was like I said that was one of

659
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:26,990
the privileges that I had and that's a

660
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:29,620
DNA thing that's in my DNA that's in

661
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:33,500
everybody's DNA that's posted it online

662
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:36,860
let's say SAT test sometimes the SAT

663
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,779
test is the SAT test to me is more of a

664
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,399
privileged thing because you can do

665
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,559
these preparatory classes and all that

666
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,918
stuff but it could be you just a good

667
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:49,158
test taker stuff like the AC T same

668
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,320
thing right but what these tests all

669
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,850
have in common is the all these tests or

670
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,029
to measure your ability to do something

671
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:01,309
and so globally you know what we've done

672
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:03,200
is globally the people that are the most

673
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,428
successful we've been we've been

674
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,789
bringing them to the States

675
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:09,649
even at h-1b visa is bringing just the

676
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,019
best people from all around around the

677
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:14,059
world I mean well I guess what I've said

678
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,730
the smartest according to some kind of

679
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,010
some kind of need or whatever so now

680
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,539
it's a global game and we're taking and

681
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,549
we're not taking on slaves anymore but

682
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,289
we're taking on people and to be honest

683
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,200
with you a lot of these people on these

684
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:29,210
these visas are treated really bad too

685
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,529
they're underpaid and all that stuff too

686
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,190
and so they can get their citizenship

687
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:35,480
and nowadays what the immigration piece

688
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,519
there's that that's all that's all a

689
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,070
mess to now so that people wait for the

690
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,440
citizenship forever

691
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,439
so this is another selection criteria

692
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,900
that we use to select people what I'm

693
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,950
what I'm big things I'm saying now is

694
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,470
that y'all know who this guy is this is

695
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,170
the CRISPR doctor this is the one who

696
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,620
supposedly genetically modified twins

697
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,810
and the story the story kind of gets all

698
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,080
kind of interpreted but the story is he

699
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:08,270
made one of his daughters it was two

700
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,030
twin girls one of them was genetically

701
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:14,810
modified to not to be resistant to HIV

702
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:17,300
so his daughter can't catch HIV the same

703
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,970
gene that they flipped or whatever did

704
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,690
they change that also makes them smarter

705
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,090
that one's so this person is gonna be

706
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:29,120
more likely to pick up stuff and they're

707
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,830
gonna be resistant to HIV like there's a

708
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,320
lot of people with a lot of money that

709
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:39,530
would pay for that right yeah I believe

710
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:43,070
that I kind of compare it to this where

711
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:46,190
far as DNA goes there's an opportunity

712
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:48,439
for somebody to submit you know

713
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,750
manufacture some kind of could could be

714
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,810
some people say HIV was manufactured

715
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,430
that could be a conspiracy theory or not

716
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:58,909
but we can definitely we definitely know

717
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:01,880
biological warfare is a real deal right

718
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:04,820
so you could certainly go in and you can

719
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,140
see who be resistive or resistant to

720
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:11,320
certain things can't believe that that's

721
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,880
happening all the time

722
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,270
it happens like what companies like this

723
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,310
they're doing this in the in agriculture

724
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,639
fill and seeds and they're suing people

725
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,980
and all this stuff so what's gonna be

726
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,350
crazy if you can start modifying DNA

727
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,840
which is CRISPR technology you can

728
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,600
immune certain people to certain things

729
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,370
and then you end up and then you can end

730
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,939
up making a lot of money off selling and

731
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:39,800
selling that cure as well there's a lot

732
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,230
of conspiracy people out there I'm not

733
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,450
really a conspiracy theory person but

734
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:50,510
it's kind of hard to ignore what's kind

735
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:52,669
of right in front of your face also like

736
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:56,029
I said the CRISPR doctor may

737
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:58,639
has made his kid more more resistant to

738
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,980
certain things there's already what they

739
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,320
call AI or machine learning that's

740
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,600
actually boxing out a lot of people for

741
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,489
instance if you have a certain criteria

742
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,869
this is this is funny as all outdoors to

743
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:13,220
me so I'm a hacker right so what I do is

744
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:17,168
I have everybody has a sock puppet

745
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:20,299
account so I have some Latino accounts

746
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:23,149
like Marco Marcos

747
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:24,529
Caruso or something like I have but

748
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,899
there's they're Hispanic names

749
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:30,350
so what's funny is when I'm when I'm

750
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:34,279
myself Marcos all my ads I see online

751
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:37,309
are black ads it's a black marine

752
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,559
national black Marines I'm just playing

753
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:45,320
our black Marines it's they're the few

754
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:46,549
the proud but but I get black ads every

755
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,549
ad I see on the Internet is black

756
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:52,820
because somebody knows I'm black for it

757
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:58,399
for all do y'all see the same thing like

758
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,590
yo yo yo no sir you don't notice it yeah

759
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:06,709
so when I switch because they're just

760
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:09,379
like you so also we know that banks in

761
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,629
and people that pick banks and all that

762
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:14,359
stuff or actually doing different credit

763
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:16,279
for zip codes you live in and all kind

764
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,080
of stuff like that insurance rates are

765
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:23,419
different all these things are different

766
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,480
so I believe that all your tendencies

767
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:27,769
are in your DNA

768
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,809
everything that's in do you have whether

769
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,879
you procrastinate what do you don't

770
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,168
because I have I have four different

771
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:37,600
kids and and all of them are different

772
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:40,359
for different kids that's under where

773
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,939
they are they're all different they're

774
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:46,939
different different like all on board

775
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,789
so but I believe that all the that in

776
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,230
the future and in China already what

777
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:53,690
they're doing is you can't leave the

778
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,139
country if you have bad credit that's

779
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,239
crazy

780
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:58,519
what if they what if they said okay we

781
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:01,009
know your DNA you have a tendency like

782
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,609
all these people have left the country

783
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:05,269
and didn't go back you have a tendency

784
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,320
to do that

785
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,730
or

786
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,210
have a tendency not to pay your bills

787
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:15,399
based on your DNA I that stuff could

788
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,399
happen in the future and it sound crazy

789
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:25,819
so you ever heard of the Golden Rule you

790
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:27,618
know what the golden rule is oh that's

791
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,779
it that's the route so there's two

792
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,819
golden rules

793
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:35,710
this guy's on it you know to go to the

794
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,710
rule don't trust this guy right here

795
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,879
three dollars the way you're gonna be

796
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:42,980
treated is the one that most people

797
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,290
that's the happy one but the real golden

798
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,300
rule is the one with the gold makes the

799
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:53,418
rules and I have 100% believe that

800
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,839
because ultimately but what we have to

801
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,810
do

802
00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:01,940
I think the good people the good people

803
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:03,770
I think I'm a good person if we do if

804
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,890
the good people can be can make the

805
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:09,829
money and control the goal then we can

806
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:12,950
actually kind of rewrite the rules now

807
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,720
what's going on now like I'm a crazy

808
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,180
person I'm posting my DNA all over the

809
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,950
place and all that stuff you might want

810
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,379
to tell people not to if they believe in

811
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,339
privacy because what I just showed you

812
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:27,260
is that that uh you have other people

813
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:31,279
posting other people's DNA online

814
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,950
sometimes it's legit because sometimes I

815
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,390
mean I'm actually in these forums this

816
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,490
ain't like in ancestry

817
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,460
and I have people posting stuff on my

818
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,890
family and so I had two different people

819
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:46,130
one of them was was working on my uncle

820
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:48,549
to get his DNA I mean get his ancestry

821
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,900
done but a lot of this stuff was wrong

822
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:55,250
so this guy that was doing my family

823
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,920
tree he he he thought my aunt my aunt

824
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,859
through her marriage was my mom I'm like

825
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,750
nah that's not that's not right but

826
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:05,180
there's people out there fiddling around

827
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,190
with your family your DNA and all that

828
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,890
stuff and you don't even know him I also

829
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:14,810
bumped into another guy that uploaded

830
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:16,940
DNA of a deceased person and they were

831
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,328
managing the account for that for that

832
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,880
family as well

833
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:25,369
right I have I seen people upload their

834
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,439
DNA twice because they forgot their D

835
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:30,319
they forgot their passwords that are

836
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:31,879
23andme account and they they what they

837
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:35,630
did they wouldn't go and bought another

838
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,729
day it wouldn't go the wind go bought

839
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,519
another swab I mean another another spit

840
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:43,609
thing and they paid for another account

841
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:47,808
like that and I'm like golly lord help

842
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:50,900
us humanity I mean you know that's a

843
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:55,400
dank password reset from hell hey you

844
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:58,099
got a submit your DNA to get faster but

845
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,459
yeah so big picture is like like no

846
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:03,979
motor concerns I wanted this to be more

847
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:07,609
of a high level talk but the facts are

848
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:10,658
you saw easily all those numbers those

849
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:13,519
numbers are easily you can easily

850
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:15,349
iterate those numbers you can grab you

851
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,658
can you can grab all the DNA kids off

852
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:21,499
these sites and I like that blew my mind

853
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:22,939
but I'm crazy because I don't care so

854
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:24,890
hopefully if I do have some good DNA

855
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:30,199
somebody put that in the crisper and

856
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:32,390
pass it along to civilization and that's

857
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,859
the end of my presentation thank you

858
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,609
very much for listening or do any

859
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:39,578
questions that means I did an amazing

860
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,929
job

861
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:44,269
so one more thing

862
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,709
I didn't plug the book but thanks a lot

863
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,658
for everybody about the tribe of hackers

864
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:50,598
book and thanks everybody got it son I

865
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:51,469
really appreciate y'all that that's

866
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,269
that's amazing

867
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,579
that that's all which I'll show love

868
00:37:53,269 --> 00:38:00,198
like that and that's the end of my we

869
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:02,929
got a question right here yeah so my dad

870
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,900
is actually the guy I thought was my dad

871
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:08,799
so his name is Joseph Bradford and I

872
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,059
can't believe that he's really my dad

873
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,489
what's crazy about it my dad doesn't

874
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:17,119
have relationships with none of his kids

875
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:19,039
and so that's luckily that's something I

876
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,689
personally and that's what I say like

877
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,880
you know the whole nurture and nature

878
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:25,219
stuff I had such a crappy childhood

879
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,880
growing up didn't make me want to be a

880
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:30,650
good father and so luckily I don't

881
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,300
believe being a being a terrible

882
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,100
father's in a DNA

883
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,480
but you know maybe we have other things

884
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,569
that we pick up from our family but

885
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,110
thank goodness but yeah my father nobody

886
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:43,910
likes him my family my sister as my

887
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,640
sister that I'm gonna have dinner with

888
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:48,799
tonight hates his guts so it's actually

889
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,089
kind of sad but he is really my

890
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,090
biological father and she's my sister

891
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,379
yes so the question the question he has

892
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,620
is is there a greater risk by posting it

893
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:19,890
on the commercial side versus the

894
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:21,540
smaller sites and so I believe that just

895
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,400
because you're a big brand and big

896
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,009
company and have a lot of money that

897
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,870
doesn't make you more secure on the

898
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,510
front end though I think that they they

899
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,130
have better controls on the front end

900
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:36,630
but like that whole jet match thing

901
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:39,330
where it's showing me thousands and

902
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,180
thousands of people matching all kind of

903
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,290
crazy sequences that's a that's a

904
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,980
problem waiting to happen

905
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:50,220
so uh yeah so I don't I don't equate how

906
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,420
big company is to how secure it is but

907
00:39:50,220 --> 00:40:03,180
me I don't have I don't believe in

908
00:39:51,420 --> 00:40:05,340
privacy I'm a weirdo so I don't care so

909
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:10,200
did I report the problems to jet match

910
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,880
is the quote is a question no I did no I

911
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,879
think it's I think it's working like it

912
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,320
says on I don't think the security flaw

913
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,750
so I think that's just the way they

914
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,480
meant it to be so I didn't I don't

915
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,790
report it and also reporting stuff is

916
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,960
kind of a pain in the butt if you like

917
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:29,970
even if somebody is doing something

918
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,770
blatantly wrong I've seen people in this

919
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,419
room here they reported stuff the

920
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,430
blockchain people and the blockchain

921
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,400
people don't face it but in the Bitcoin

922
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:41,399
and other cryptocurrencies I've seen

923
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,290
people's you know I've seen the Bitcoin

924
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,350
people try to sue people and all that

925
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:49,050
stuff so I you know I I just assume they

926
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,819
know what they're doing so there's a

927
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,830
there's an old school thing and I think

928
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,310
it comes from Oakland the game is to be

929
00:40:52,830 --> 00:41:00,120
sold not so I don't really believe that

930
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:02,210
but anybody oh one more question over

931
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,210
here

932
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:18,150
so so they caught a serial killer

933
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:21,569
based on she saying that they but they

934
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,489
call a circular based on DNA what what

935
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:26,729
he catch other people other criminals

936
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:28,709
I believe they they will catch they will

937
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:30,569
catch them and if I'm related to them I

938
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:32,519
think they should do the crime they

939
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:35,880
should they should do whatever time they

940
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,049
have I don't I don't really I mean it's

941
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,660
definitely if I have somebody's done

942
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:40,920
some crazy heinous like that but I

943
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,779
wonder if that's gonna change the

944
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,369
statute of limitations I don't know I

945
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:47,819
think this is definitely gonna be a big

946
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:50,099
legal situation I've also thought about

947
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,660
like some experimentation on on

948
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:56,309
capturing people DNA without them

949
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:58,499
knowing it like if I if somebody drinks

950
00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:00,150
something like try to swab it and throw

951
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:03,499
it into container and send it off real

952
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,499
quick let me bb-dub

953
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,750
yeah

954
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:46,589
yes so basically some of us are genetic

955
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:47,520
mutants and sometimes yeah windows yeah

956
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,650
how do you keep your stuff from people

957
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,960
that are gonna be the first so the first

958
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,160
part of it was 23andme recently said

959
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,770
they're working with medical companies

960
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,330
or the related medical companies and

961
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,240
they're doing medical research based on

962
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:02,279
it I think that that's definitely I

963
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,100
think most things that we talk about in

964
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,360
security aren't technical things I think

965
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,060
that's something we should talk to your

966
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,220
congressperson about your you know those

967
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,529
are political things and try to get in

968
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,450
contact with people that are in politics

969
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,430
they regulate the healthcare stuff

970
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,319
starting with like probably the state

971
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,330
level may be your local local

972
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,300
congressperson at a state level and

973
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:26,430
enter congressperson from a state level

974
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,220
that and the people that are on those

975
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,859
medical and FDA approval panels and all

976
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,120
