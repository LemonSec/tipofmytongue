00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
welcome to b-sides Orlando at Full Sail

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,529
University today we have Bobo and Mike

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,809
felch bo is a penetration tester at

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,150
Black Hills information security where

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,250
he performs various security assessments

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,590
for organizations bo as a host of

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,590
tradecraft security weekly hacker

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,600
dialogues and the coin sect podcast he

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,600
has spoken at industry events including

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,650
blackhat Arsenal Derby con Wild West

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,439
hack and fest

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,409
besides events including this one and

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,140
various sands conferences Mike felch

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,210
began his career in 1997 as a Linux

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,890
administrator which eventually led to

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,170
numerous offensive security roles

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,719
software development and hardware

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,550
software security research Michael is

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,739
also a lead forensics instructor for

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:57,980
teal Tech and an officer for wasp

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:01:00,660
Orlando chief breaker hey everybody hey

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,180
thanks for coming I can't see you I hope

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,880
you can see me that the smoke is real

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,900
yeah cool so we are talking about

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,860
weaponizing corporate Intel this is

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,479
gonna be a little bit of a different

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,770
talk it's kind of kind of be a morph of

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,170
getting a little bit personal as you can

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,729
see this time it's gonna be personal and

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,439
then we'll see kind of where this goes

31
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,000
yeah so the big thing about this one

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,908
that I want to kind of iterate upfront

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,400
is that the first half of this talk I

34
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,579
feel like is kind of a review of over

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,140
like almost like a recon 101 methodology

36
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,149
like kind of this the stuff that we do

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,409
on a lot of the assessments we do but I

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,270
feel like it's very important to cover

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280
because I think that all of the things

40
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,548
leading up to what we kind of reveal

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,939
later will have much more impact knowing

42
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,590
how we kind of can use that data so

43
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,398
we're gonna go from we're gonna talk

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,869
about going from basically zero

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,390
knowledge of an organization that we're

46
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,860
attacking to to understanding their

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,140
external infrastructure understanding

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,229
employees to getting to really scary

49
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,299
personal levels about the employees like

50
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,209
it's yeah it's it's frightening stuff

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,670
yeah and then we're gonna talk about

52
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,410
some some newer ish kind of password

53
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,819
attacks that we're gonna be gonna go

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,609
over and

55
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,078
/ kind of we tossed around like what we

56
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,549
should call like the type of password

57
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:21,140
that we're going to talk about it's kind

58
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,489
of password stuffing but it's not really

59
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,018
a little different so it's kind of weird

60
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,390
and then we're gonna do some weird new

61
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,090
out-of-band phishing social engineering

62
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,659
kind of stuff so we want to go through

63
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,159
this again

64
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:37,700
she already did yep intro to this and

65
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,409
sure alrighty so like I said tact

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
surface recon this is the the first half

67
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,400
of this presentation is mainly kind of

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,930
going over how do we how do we learn

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
about the organization we're attacking

70
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,489
how do we learn about what external

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,280
assets they have and okay how can we do

72
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,680
that in a and in a manner that is it's

73
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,260
somewhat not attributable and then we'll

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,459
get to some more advanced methods of

75
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,769
maintaining non attribution later on

76
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,909
first off let's talk about just

77
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,769
scratching the surface of building a

78
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,480
solid target list right

79
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,980
you know whenever you go to look at

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,540
attacking at a company I mean obviously

81
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,888
like you could you know google them and

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,750
search their name and figure out like

83
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,030
what domains they own through that but

84
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,190
what we really want identifies attackers

85
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,079
is where are their employees remotely

86
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,639
accessing their organization are they

87
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,340
using some sort of VPN infrastructure

88
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,169
how can we learn how they're accessing

89
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,209
email are they be using chat

90
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,769
applications and then if we can if we

91
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,400
can discover security products well

92
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:38,440
that's also you know helpful later on

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,060
towards the exploitation phase right so

94
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,459
baby steps right first things first

95
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,260
let's just google the domain let's do

96
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,680
some some Google Dorking so like your

97
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,448
typical site colon domain name.com you

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,129
know then start your removing those

99
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,870
domains and you start learning about

100
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,790
what domains are just cached by Google

101
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,250
and then you've also got things like

102
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,709
Bing where you can you can buy an API

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,319
key and use their API to look up that

104
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,609
means as well all of these slides that

105
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,470
I'm not going to go through here I'm

106
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,519
gonna include the Recon in G modules at

107
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,199
the bottom of these just to kind of show

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,199
these are some of the modules that you

109
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,060
would use within this toolkit so recon

110
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,489
in G is an open source tool to perform

111
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,858
reconnaissance does not only host

112
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,779
discovery but users and employee

113
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,229
discovery as well so these are the

114
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,580
models for that if you want to look up

115
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,930
companies in China by to use the Chinese

116
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,620
search engine so Baidu

117
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,040
I left

118
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,260
there to netbox look net block lookups

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,870
so the next step obviously like after

120
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,780
figuring out what domains a company owns

121
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,550
we want to know what net block

122
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,739
infrastructure they have and a lot of

123
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,240
that we typically like I I will either

124
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,790
do like a root you know resolve like an

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,500
IP that we know is a domain that they

126
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,780
own and then try to figure out based off

127
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,880
of that net block what what other eye

128
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,530
peas are around that some other good

129
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,570
good resources are this two the first

130
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,940
one the BGP HDNet that's hurricane

131
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,889
Electric which if you know uses another

132
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,620
really good source for looking up a SNS

133
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,410
for a company which will help you

134
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,389
identify additional net blocks and I

135
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,100
used MX toolbox that that site there

136
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,199
quite a bit whenever it and looking up

137
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,910
like a single IP and want to determine

138
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,979
what net blocks are associated with that

139
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,539
single IP and you know a lot of cases we

140
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,800
deal with like companies that that

141
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,199
either hosts our own infrastructure or

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,300
they're using like a third party like

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,889
larger hosting company and in those

144
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,570
cases it can be you know tough because a

145
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,789
lot of times like those infrastructures

146
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,000
that you know they're they're you know

147
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,159
selling millions of I keys to you know

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,860
customers around the world so it can be

149
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,930
kind of hard to identify but in a lot of

150
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,090
cases we can kind of like gather at

151
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,169
least an idea around the subnets close

152
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,820
to where they're they're at so subdomain

153
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,049
discovery so this is a huge topic right

154
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,969
like there's probably like I don't know

155
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,190
100 tools that do subdomain discovery

156
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,349
there's there's a lot of lot of them out

157
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,410
there and they all do somewhat subtle

158
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:58,729
differences I mean I showed in is one of

159
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,800
my favorites obviously if you never if

160
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,229
you're her to show Dan it's it's a tool

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,690
that basically port skins a lot of the

162
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,030
internet and you can search it for four

163
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,190
domains host names and kind of create a

164
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,888
list off of that since this does the

165
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,870
same thing since SEO DNS dumpsters great

166
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,190
for looking up subdomains all these

167
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,860
tools are basically just sites you would

168
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,050
you would go to type in the domain and

169
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,729
hopefully get back a list of sub domains

170
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,639
that are kind of already oh you know

171
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,530
known subdomain brute-forcing is another

172
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,510
technique you can use where basically

173
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,250
you just supplying a list of subdomains

174
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,650
and just doing lookups and seeing if any

175
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,919
of those exist so fairly further

176
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,000
straightforward additional top-level

177
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,758
domains so this is another thing that

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,099
that I think that

179
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,330
I don't know if a lot of pen testers are

180
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,789
looking for this a lot of a lot of pen

181
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,589
testers probably go after the main

182
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,930
domain for most organizations right your

183
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:52,020
primary you know dot-com domain but how

184
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,809
many are trying to discover additional

185
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,339
top-level domains so like your your your

186
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:59,979
other domains that are hosted by the

187
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,569
same company but are a different name

188
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,589
you know and instead of just looking at

189
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,629
subdomains let's look at top-level

190
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,979
domains too and one of the best ways

191
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,319
that we've kind of found to do that is

192
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,680
through certificate transparency so the

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,979
the websites CR T SH you can you can

194
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,800
look up domains and get this the SSL

195
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,240
certs back from from those domains and

196
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,669
within the SSL certs a lot of times you

197
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,219
can find additional domains that are

198
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,899
also under those services yeah so the

199
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,120
interesting thing about certain H though

200
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,499
is so what they do is they they are

201
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,059
actually monitoring all the different

202
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,499
certificate registrations and then

203
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,659
they're parsing the certificates and

204
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,339
then storing them in a Postgres database

205
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,839
and then they just create like a search

206
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,210
where you can go there and you could

207
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,129
search using like wildcard searches for

208
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,479
the domain and pull back all of the

209
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,939
certificates that were ever registered

210
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,740
using either the domain name or a

211
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,659
subject alternative name with that

212
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,339
domain name in there the cool thing with

213
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,990
that is you'll get back all the other

214
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,430
domains as well now sometimes there's

215
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,409
gonna be false positives right because

216
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,879
you go to CloudFlare CloudFlare might

217
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,039
give you one of the free certs where

218
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,770
they matched your domain into somebody

219
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,628
else's domain you guys kind of share a

220
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,639
SSL certificate but the cool thing that

221
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,620
I found out about certain Sh recently

222
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,689
was they open sourced access to their

223
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,370
Postgres database so you don't even have

224
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,439
to query certain Sh you could actually

225
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,289
connect straight into the Postgres

226
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,749
database it's free it's a public access

227
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,370
and you could query the actual record

228
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,319
isn't pull back the data they also open

229
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,729
source all of their data so I mean all

230
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,709
of their tools so all their parsing

231
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,058
tools all of their their I mean their

232
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,469
database models everything that they

233
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,569
have they all kind of open-source it and

234
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:33,279
you could basically just reap repeat

235
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,219
what they've done and kind of pull it in

236
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,409
but so yeah that's one of the say that

237
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,209
oh yeah sure and so you know we

238
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,010
mentioned showed an earlier you know

239
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,779
again like you can use you can use net

240
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,010
blocks as well as domains on on showed a

241
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,649
dance and a lot of times you'll get back

242
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,540
you know certain IP addresses that are

243
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,400
owned within the same subnet or the same

244
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,199
net blocks it's owned by a company

245
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,300
you'll just visibly see that it's it's

246
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,770
using a different domain based off of

247
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,430
like this cell so he comes back yeah

248
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,900
showdown and then oh the very important

249
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,640
fact here is rinse and repeat all that

250
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,930
so like once you've kind of gathered

251
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,490
your your net block list once you've

252
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,569
learned about new top awful demands go

253
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,700
back to the beginning and start you know

254
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,380
brute-forcing subdomains again searching

255
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,900
for more subdomains and we end up with a

256
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,370
rather large list at this point the cool

257
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,290
thing is now you have domains and you

258
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,760
have subdomains for demands and you have

259
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,290
net blocks and now you could kind of

260
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,279
start I mean manually you could do it

261
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,529
easy and you just you just

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,520
cross-reference the subnets you see

263
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,510
these other domains you don't know if

264
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,920
they're in scope but then you look at

265
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,839
the IP address and you realize they are

266
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,099
in scope and which is a really big deal

267
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,690
because you can't really just hit IP

268
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,570
addresses if you know I mean you hit a

269
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,010
webserver and if you're not passing in

270
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,960
the actual hostname to that web server

271
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,210
Apache or nginx they don't know how to

272
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,700
route that that web request to the

273
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,810
actual web server and then a lot of

274
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,540
times you have like virtual hosting we

275
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,739
have like 20 domain names on the same IP

276
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,480
address all different applications okay

277
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,980
so the other very important thing that

278
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,720
we always look for ordering assessments

279
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,980
is what cloud services is the

280
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,920
organization that we're testing using

281
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,089
and you know primarily one of the things

282
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,890
that we always look for our microsoft

283
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,690
services because we've had a pretty good

284
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,830
history with assessing companies that

285
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,060
use things like o365 so office 365 is

286
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,709
really easy to determine if an

287
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,709
organization uses because you just

288
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:17,349
basically go to Outlook dot office 365

289
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,660
comm and attempt to log in with you know

290
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,610
any any username at the company name

291
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,760
comm at the domain name and you can

292
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,120
really quickly get redirected to their

293
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,130
their custom portal or you don't it's

294
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,230
just like that that doesn't exist

295
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,209
SharePoint it's another one similar

296
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,060
similar problem where I mean if the

297
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:39,219
company's using it and you can somewhat

298
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,479
guess the the domain name or the company

299
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,830
name that they would be using with

300
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,650
SharePoint you can just do company name

301
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,300
SharePoint comm and then finding Skype

302
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,150
for business so a lot of companies will

303
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,120
host a DNS record for link discover dot

304
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,949
their domain name.com so that their

305
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,860
Skype for business clients can connect

306
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,620
and that's another one that we look for

307
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,070
as well because link as well as the

308
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,600
other office 365 services we we target

309
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,050
heavily because a lot of those are

310
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,170
connected

311
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,430
eighty Active Directory so whenever

312
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,640
we're looking for these external portals

313
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,130
I would say that I'm primarily looking

314
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,529
for Active Directory connected portals

315
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,480
you know for if we're looking at like I

316
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,510
don't know like think of like any other

317
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,209
type of web service port of like Tomcat

318
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,100
any other standard portal a lot of that

319
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,209
stuff isn't technically connected to the

320
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,370
internal infrastructure and is not

321
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,540
necessarily that useful to me unless

322
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,880
it's like you know default credentials

323
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,260
on Tomcat and then you know login and

324
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,779
you know upload the war file and stuff

325
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,189
so for other cloud services Google

326
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,540
saying it has similar problem except

327
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,870
with Google you do kind of have to have

328
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,519
a an actual email address of somebody

329
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,320
that exists so you have to know

330
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,850
somebody's actual email address and then

331
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
you know you attempt to log in with

332
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,390
Google and it will let you know whether

333
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,890
or not that account exists or not it'll

334
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,640
prompt you for the password yeah exactly

335
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:03,250
yeah box com I don't know it has anyone

336
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,610
see the the recent news about box I'm

337
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,250
like last week it was a yeah there was a

338
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:12,610
really interesting report that was done

339
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,680
where a lot of the top like many of the

340
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,110
top companies out there like so Apple I

341
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,930
think discovery like Discovery Channel a

342
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,790
few of those companies had a number of

343
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,890
publicly available files that they were

344
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,770
hosting on box comm that were accessible

345
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,540
just be via google searching so Google

346
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,089
is caching a lot of these publicly

347
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,279
available files that were hosted on box

348
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,899
so it turns out I mean the the URL to

349
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,610
login for a company is your you know

350
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,040
whatever name you sign up with company

351
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,880
name dot account i box comm so this is

352
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,319
another one of the things that I've

353
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,540
started looking for now on assessments

354
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,990
is looking to see do they use box and if

355
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,899
they do you can also create custom URLs

356
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,279
within box for files so let's say that I

357
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,649
have you know a giant infrastructure and

358
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,180
I want to share a file with Mike I can

359
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,910
name it like here's cool files you know

360
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,719
and it's just like company named account

361
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,110
de box com

362
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,070
slash s slash cool files and there's

363
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,779
actually there's a tool out there now

364
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,820
you can go in brute force those file

365
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,500
names so that's another avenue to try to

366
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,910
find like files it not necessarily

367
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,160
cached by Google but are publicly

368
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,770
available

369
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,839
Amos on AWS so look to see where web

370
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,140
resources are being loaded so you could

371
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,850
load up like the

372
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,439
the company's website and then look

373
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,940
within the the requests that are being

374
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,890
sent seeing if they're being hosted in

375
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,050
like s3 buckets just kind of give you an

376
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,180
idea of whether or not the company is

377
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,349
utilizing that type of infrastructure

378
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,060
which can be useful later on yep oh yeah

379
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,180
so a lot of that was just basically kind

380
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,770
of getting an idea of what domains what

381
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,939
hosts what were what am I gonna try to

382
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:46,430
target right now when we look at doing

383
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,610
password attacks right we want we want a

384
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,829
portal that has a high possibility or

385
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,570
high probability of being something that

386
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,070
is like I said Active Directory

387
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,460
connected or something that we can

388
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,370
utilize to to successfully you know

389
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,330
authenticate us your employees right so

390
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,620
this next step is finding those portals

391
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,570
so you you know we can move into this

392
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,360
active phase at this point right where

393
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,250
we could start port scanning in in my

394
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,780
case what I typically do is I just scan

395
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,510
for the web ports like common web board

396
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,770
it's like 84 43 I put 23 81 in here just

397
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,240
because that's that's HP system

398
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,610
management home page and I've had pretty

399
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,280
good luck finding various form abilities

400
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,590
with HP system management home page 80

401
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,050
80 84 84 4-3 so this is something like

402
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,790
the more common ones that we see and

403
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,050
after you kind of get that that port

404
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,079
scan list so like within map you could

405
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,380
you could output it to an XML file and

406
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,810
take that XML file and now feed it to I

407
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,580
witness so Chris fronter wrote this

408
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,189
amazing tool which I'm sure many of you

409
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,900
have used where basically it performs

410
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,850
screenshotting for you of web

411
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,079
applications so on assessments you know

412
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,910
we'll do assessments where we have like

413
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,400
a thousand web servers and it's like I

414
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,430
could literally go browse them myself

415
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,110
and spend the rest of my life just

416
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,699
manually looking at these web pages or I

417
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,550
comes have a tool automate screenshots

418
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,320
put in a nice HTML format and I can just

419
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,290
kind of scroll through it quickly and

420
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,690
and that what I found through doing that

421
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,939
is I'm able to find interesting stuff

422
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,260
faster right things that I want to

423
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,360
actually go attack and what I do with

424
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,040
that that like list of a thousand

425
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,780
screenshots now is I'll start making

426
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,730
another list of just interesting things

427
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,189
that I you know might have like a kind

428
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,220
of an idea like what what they might be

429
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,090
hosting there or something that I'm on

430
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,560
lunch entry

431
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,060
to see what else is there like a lot of

432
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,829
times we'll find like like let's say a

433
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,250
server that has just like a default

434
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,600
Tomcat install you know we can we can

435
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,330
throw that in another list and then

436
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,280
we'll use it with a secondary brute

437
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,190
force of files and directories which I'm

438
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,300
gonna talk about next

439
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,380
so see Boris wrote a PowerShell script

440
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,010
this part of PowerShell Empire called

441
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,600
find fruit and when he wrote that the

442
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,150
idea was that you could pass it an

443
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,740
epilogue and like so this would be like

444
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,720
for like an internal assessment right

445
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,220
and you could pass it a net block and it

446
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,500
would just try to look for like the top

447
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,750
like 10 files like interesting files

448
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,880
things like like your your Tomcats your

449
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,320
app at your various portals cope

450
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,060
ColdFusion that kind of stuff that are

451
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,160
on an internal network so that if you

452
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,270
were to try to look for things that

453
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,880
might have vulnerabilities those might

454
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,380
be the things you go look for so I kind

455
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,200
of wanted something similar to that but

456
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,790
at scale for for externals so I I'm

457
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,060
modified his script and I call it brute

458
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,880
fruit and basically what it does is you

459
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:38,119
pass it a file list and a URL list so

460
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,980
like I know you know I have 50 web

461
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,810
servers or 100 web servers that I know

462
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,190
that I wanna I want a brute force files

463
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,020
on them but I don't want to like

464
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,050
manually go and use like doorbuster or

465
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,090
Derby or W fuzz against each one of them

466
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,439
individually I want to do it at scale

467
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,570
against all of them and then just see

468
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,770
the output so that's that's what this is

469
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,660
and I've got a quick demo which will

470
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,660
play of how that works

471
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,490
cool so at first here you can kind of

472
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,408
see I have a file list or I'm sorry a

473
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,150
URL list so this would be like what I've

474
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,699
crafted from my eyewitness list of

475
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,280
interesting files this is now the list

476
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,559
of potential files or directories that I

477
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,270
want to use and and see if they exist on

478
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,770
the web server

479
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,629
so with brew fruit I've already imported

480
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,549
it into PowerShell here I'm gonna pass

481
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,870
at my dictionary which is the the web

482
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,510
web root

483
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,030
- list text see see there so that's

484
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,580
that's the the the files let me give it

485
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,559
a timeout of 3000 give it 10 threads and

486
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,330
I'm only looking for files to come back

487
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,210
as found right like the files that are

488
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,949
actually exist and whenever we run this

489
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,380
this actually would take this took about

490
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,630
seven minutes to do thirty thousand

491
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,280
requests so we're looking at yeah you

492
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,559
can see like the total number of URLs is

493
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,240
thirty thousand I sped it up for the

494
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,820
sake of the demo but you can kind of see

495
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,860
like we get back output showing like so

496
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,110
I found some ColdFusion URLs out there

497
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,209
you know II store found EWS and oo on

498
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,850
one of them found some web dev stuff

499
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,130
WordPress but the idea is basically I'm

500
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:21,250
looking at looking for interesting stuff

501
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:21,250
at scale so

502
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,660
after we kind of discover some of these

503
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,060
files that we sinker interesting or some

504
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,220
of these web servers now it becomes okay

505
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,020
so I understand I have somewhat of an

506
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,120
understanding of the external attack

507
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,250
surface now I know I know where I'm

508
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,969
going to perform my attacks you're going

509
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,150
on up ahead

510
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,890
I don't know how to use PowerPoint oh

511
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm not a Microsoft person I am no idea

512
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:55,580
just jump ahead to the other one sorry

513
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,280
we'll be there yeah so now now I want to

514
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,129
figure out okay what what are they using

515
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,149
as like a username schema how can i how

516
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,600
can i enumerate Active Directory

517
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,770
information as an external attacker so

518
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,370
this is where we're gonna talk about

519
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:14,360
remotely gathering Intel internal domain

520
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,429
information externally so alright on a

521
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,810
lot of vulnerability scanners your info

522
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,980
disclosure of vulnerabilities are

523
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,429
typically rated as either like

524
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,320
informational or low but I'm a very firm

525
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,410
believer that it is critical to an

526
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,450
attackers process to understand what

527
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,610
your internal infrastructure looks like

528
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,130
from an external perspective and info

529
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,350
disclosure can be huge I mean that's

530
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,510
like if I don't know your internal

531
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,969
domain name or I don't know your user

532
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,650
name schema like my pastor attacks are

533
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,450
done at that point I mean sure if you

534
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,100
have an email portal externally

535
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,960
accessible I might be able to use like

536
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,600
email addresses but in a lot of cases

537
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,790
we're looking at authenticating via like

538
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,810
the ad you know domain and slash

539
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,280
username so I I feel that in order to be

540
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,750
successful you need you need the

541
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,700
username format first of all as an

542
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,710
attacker and then secondly you need the

543
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,750
probability of a user being able to

544
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,070
actually authenticate to that portal so

545
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,020
we're looking at things like like oh ah

546
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,970
right like a lot of your users typically

547
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,170
have access to OA office 365 same thing

548
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,150
you know those are the types of portals

549
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,280
were looking at so one of the things

550
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,190
that this is just one example of a

551
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,899
username enumeration vulnerability is

552
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,220
with OA it actually has a timing

553
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,680
vulnerability and this is something that

554
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,050
has been known for a long time where

555
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,270
when I go to authenticate it as a user

556
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,040
it's there's a vast difference in the

557
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,620
amount of time the application responds

558
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,990
to my login request if I have a valid

559
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,239
user account versus an invalid use

560
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,650
at home so I can look at the timing

561
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,480
coming back and it you know it's still

562
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,330
the webpage says invalid login

563
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,070
regardless but it takes let's say six

564
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,178
hundred milliseconds more for the

565
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,629
application and come back and tell me

566
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:54,760
that the username is invalid and and so

567
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,010
we can kind of craft a list of valid

568
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,300
user names off of that technique so one

569
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,500
of the things you can use the mail

570
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,230
sniper to do that another way to get

571
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,400
user name information is through

572
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,070
metadata that's attached to publicly

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,650
available files so another tool that we

574
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,240
wrote at Black Hills is power meta and

575
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,309
this one basically does the same thing

576
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,870
that your focus and there's actually now

577
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:20,590
go qey which I heard about today from

578
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:22,330
Ralph which basically search Google for

579
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,639
your domain name and they do the typical

580
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,159
google dork right where it says you know

581
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,010
site domain name and then file type

582
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,540
colon XLS and so that would basically

583
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,750
just pull back all the Excel files and

584
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,580
same thing for like PDFs Word documents

585
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,320
you name it so it goes and grabs all

586
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,750
those those entries that are in Google

587
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,550
and then goes and downloads all of them

588
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,580
directly from whatever the target domain

589
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,889
is and once those files are downloaded a

590
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,139
lot of times your your typical

591
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,510
administrative staff have not scrubbed

592
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,330
the metadata that's attached to those

593
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,990
files and let's say that I'm marketer

594
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,490
and I create a nice PDF that has all

595
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,350
kinds of like flashy stuff about my

596
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,200
company in it and I post that on my

597
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,760
website to try to show you know what

598
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,230
service is my company does that kind of

599
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,390
thing if I haven't gone and scrubbed the

600
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,160
metadata from that my username my

601
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,929
internal domain username might be

602
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,700
attached to that metadata which is now

603
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,800
externally available so this is

604
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,550
basically what we're looking for we also

605
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,590
know that you run office 2013 yep yeah

606
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,780
you get software versions a lot of times

607
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,240
you get directories that they use so you

608
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,740
might get some like information on like

609
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,630
internal server names that kind of thing

610
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,510
so look at the metadata attached to

611
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,540
publicly available files free domain

612
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,190
okay so a lot of this like port scanning

613
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,159
looking at like the brute forcing the

614
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:45,550
files on on websites looking at metadata

615
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,340
the problem we have is IP address right

616
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,780
sure we can we can use other tools like

617
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,280
we there's been a few different tools

618
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
there's been proxy cannon which has been

619
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,260
a

620
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,389
good one which spins up a number of ec2

621
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,220
instances Amazon ec2 instances and you

622
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,930
can kind of pivot your your-your-your

623
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,510
attacks against a web server through

624
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,000
that so the the the company they'll see

625
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,860
something like maybe like what 10 or 12

626
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,500
addresses different I yeah different IPS

627
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,939
or sucks but then you have to change it

628
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,940
every time and find good Sox

629
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,280
transparency proxies cred King I broke

630
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,840
Red King for password spraying Google we

631
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,000
released that last year which was using

632
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,830
AWS lamda which is really cool because

633
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
it was lightweight but you're still

634
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,340
limited because you're only limited

635
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,170
you're limited back down to the lambda

636
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,330
regions which i think is like 12 so you

637
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,830
get 12 rotating IPs

638
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,419
but I mean it so it's good if you're

639
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,590
doing like a slow spray or doing

640
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,350
something like that where eventually

641
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,939
it'll change but most of I think all

642
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,469
those solutions that were out were

643
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,620
either heavy where you have to spin up

644
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,420
VPS is or use a VPN and do VPN rotation

645
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,729
or proxy Canon which was really heavy on

646
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,910
ec2 great tool but takes a lot of

647
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,770
overhead and IP routing and traffic so

648
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,280
there really wasn't too much I think

649
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,520
available yeah so I spent a little bit

650
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,320
of time trying to solve this problem and

651
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,760
obviously a lot of problems boil back

652
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,230
down to the IP address cuz most of the

653
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,700
threat modeling is gonna look at IP

654
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,460
addresses most of the Logging's IP

655
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,370
addresses so yeah we have really great

656
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,429
Sims and all these magic dashboards and

657
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,780
single pane of glass cool things but the

658
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:16,130
problem is you know once we start

659
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,899
looking at it from the IP perspective

660
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,860
it's really hard to rotate rotate that

661
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,870
so doing some research actually I was

662
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,409
doing some research with lambda and I

663
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,909
spoke with actually Ralph May and he was

664
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,179
like dude why don't you just use API

665
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,650
gateway and so this is really his idea I

666
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,540
just kind of weaponized it unless a

667
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,270
little bit so it's all credit to him for

668
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,070
actually bringing this to the table but

669
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,790
what we have is API gateway so with

670
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,800
Amazon AWS the API gateway what we

671
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,040
learned is if you set the API gateway as

672
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,610
a proxy pass-through and using like any

673
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,120
of the methods so like get post head any

674
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,620
of the web methods you could set it up

675
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,370
where it'll actually route all of your

676
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,350
traffic to the Amazon API URL that they

677
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,500
provide you and then it points that URL

678
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,330
to your

679
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,130
and target the cool thing with that is

680
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,840
every single web request that goes

681
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,270
through that actually rotates your IP

682
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,949
address so you can imagine now unlimited

683
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,270
pool of IP addresses where you could

684
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,130
thread all of these tools through

685
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,240
whether it's power meta all those tools

686
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,500
that you looked at earlier any of the

687
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,690
brute fruit or we used to be really

688
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,890
scared to touch infrastructure because

689
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,390
infrastructure you would touch it you

690
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,560
touch too many of them across the IP

691
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,880
range and next thing you know they're

692
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,000
logging and they got alert so they burn

693
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,650
your c2 so that's what this does

694
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,940
basically is it sets that up the cool

695
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,810
thing with it is I built a little tool

696
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,490
called fire procs

697
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,129
and when fire procs does is it's

698
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,990
managing these proxy urls for you so you

699
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,300
can list them you can create them you

700
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,830
could delete them you could point them

701
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,220
and you could scrape you could spray

702
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,720
passwords you can crawl websites I may

703
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,600
or may not have crawled the Internet

704
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,430
like crazy in the last six months I may

705
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,659
not have a lot of data I've got like

706
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,700
terabytes of data that I've been

707
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,990
collecting I'm a data connoisseur I

708
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,000
can't give you all the data that I have

709
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,530
but and I'm probably not gonna make the

710
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,080
data available but I'll release the

711
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,280
tools so you can kind of do it yourself

712
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,290
and the other cool thing with it is

713
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,910
it'll help with bypassing the CAPTCHAs

714
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,710
so you know the sometimes you have

715
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,240
laughs that'll block it on IP multiple

716
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,800
requests after like five like fail to

717
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,330
ban I think does that or if you makes

718
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,120
too many requests back to back to back

719
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,939
it'll ban your IP or the CAPTCHAs that

720
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,350
there are triggering off of IP the only

721
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,910
downside that I've seen to this which I

722
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,260
think I feel like there's a way to get

723
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,600
around and I just haven't had enough

724
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,860
time to focus on it is if you're

725
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,110
familiar with the x-forwarded-for

726
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,689
host header whenever you send a web

727
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,429
request to a proxy the API gateway will

728
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,290
actually add the source IP as the

729
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,940
x-forwarded-for so there's still ways to

730
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,070
detect it it's just none of them are

731
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,720
actually working right now and so I've

732
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,179
used this on everything from Google to

733
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,920
Bing to LinkedIn to lots of other stuff

734
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,140
we're gonna see here in a minute and

735
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,550
I've just been collecting data and

736
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,200
aggregating it and creating it into a

737
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,669
data set and I have massive data sets

738
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
kind of across the board and where I'm

739
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,850
starting to reconcile this data and it's

740
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,430
scary it's scary

741
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,199
just kind of what's out there so with

742
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,960
that I have a little demo here hopefully

743
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,580
this works you want to get this back on

744
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,020
PowerPoint after I'm done that way I

745
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,199
don't screw it up because I don't know

746
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,480
Microsoft stuff I'm sorry okay so what I

747
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,820
have here is I'm just gonna run this

748
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,670
simple little it's just a little Python

749
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,799
web server and you can't see that I

750
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:23,730
wonder

751
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,940
hmm you like my demo err this is it just

752
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,650
taking a second okay so what i'm doing

753
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,740
here is i'm just binding on zero zero

754
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,390
zero zero and so i'm gonna leave that

755
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,299
there for a second and I'm gonna use

756
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:39,270
fire props here just to kind of show you

757
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,379
the the command line stuff so you pretty

758
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,600
it's pretty straightforward you pass in

759
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,669
an access key a secret access key the

760
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,039
region if you want and you're basically

761
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:48,179
just passing in the destination with a

762
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,379
copy and paste it because I don't like

763
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:54,840
mistyping and so I'm gonna go ahead and

764
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,000
just create a new proxy I'm gonna point

765
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,709
to that besides Orlando Dez report comm

766
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,559
was just some domain that I had floating

767
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,299
around yes this is gonna be live so feel

768
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,789
free to control rickroll whatever you

769
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,049
want to do okay so what I just did was I

770
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:11,820
created it and if you look right here

771
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:15,120
you'll see that now this new URL right

772
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,129
here is now pointing at besides Orlando

773
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,320
esra report comm so if I make a web

774
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,740
request wait for it to catch up okay

775
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,889
cool

776
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,740
to whatever I want you're gonna see my

777
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,169
IP don't hack me this is my tether IP

778
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,120
don't don't screw me up here okay so you

779
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:35,429
see the IP over here on the far left and

780
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,020
so for some reason when you use python

781
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,159
it shows like two different line entries

782
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,158
for each request it's just kind of

783
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,429
stupid but it's how it goes so so i

784
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,649
wrote another little tool that just it's

785
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,909
really small it's just like similar you

786
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:51,360
know similar to what he just showed but

787
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:52,649
it's called brute Python brute it's

788
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,689
super small it's just like this little

789
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,418
Open File it's gonna go through take the

790
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,570
URL you pass it and try to brute force

791
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,980
this stuff and I'm gonna run this and

792
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,490
just let this ride and you're gonna see

793
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,130
IP is gonna rotate on the left for each

794
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:14,700
one assuming I hit enter which I didn't

795
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:15,840
I did maybe that was not working I'm

796
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:23,690
already denial of service you guys

797
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,689
killed me and it's dead and it's dead

798
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,759
so you just pass in the URL which is not

799
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:10,850
and do I have internet I'm connected let

800
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:14,389
me just try it this way web server die

801
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:17,120
yeah I'm just gonna reset it there we go

802
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,680
there we go BAM so you see every request

803
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,350
is rotating the IP address over here on

804
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,030
the far left and so now we have an

805
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,320
unlimited amount of IP space that we

806
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,990
could use as long as we don't exhaust

807
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,399
all of Amazon's sorry Carrie I know

808
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,000
Kerry works at Amazon here so she's

809
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,080
probably not too happy but we're at

810
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,180
least Amazon might not be too happy

811
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,710
she's super awesome so I'm sure she's

812
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,940
cool with it but so you see it's just

813
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,320
unlimited it just keeps going and going

814
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,570
and going so now we have a really easy

815
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,129
lightweight way of rotating IP addresses

816
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,939
for every single request I'm gonna stop

817
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:49,190
this and get out of here before it

818
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,840
denial of services everything else it's

819
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,730
a good good luck shunning that kind of

820
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,899
Siegen yeah I mean I mean the only thing

821
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,050
you could really do it at that point you

822
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,220
want to restart this on the Firefox so

823
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,950
the only thing you could really do at

824
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,480
this point is you can't just check on

825
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,890
the IP addresses you actually have to

826
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,500
look at the x-forwarded-for if it's

827
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:09,500
present it gets really hairy too because

828
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,790
what happens is as as you route them

829
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,320
through so if I wanted to point that

830
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,460
proxy at another proxy and point that

831
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,870
one at another one and then to the

832
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,940
destination it's gonna route it all the

833
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,969
way through but now your your exported

834
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,860
for is gonna be like five levels deep so

835
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,540
what we found now I'm just kind of

836
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,010
recapping a little bit about what kind

837
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,810
of both step through we found with some

838
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,330
great hosts and portals I highlighted in

839
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,310
red just was easier to see we also have

840
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,659
identified running services so now we

841
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,700
know kind of where the portals are what

842
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,200
hosts are out there running we've also

843
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,520
got target servers in the site we just

844
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,660
need to start finding employees and this

845
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,160
is kind of where we move into the more

846
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,390
of the personal approach this is kind of

847
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,850
the nuts and bolts of everything coming

848
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,680
together so one to introduce this

849
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,870
concept that we've been calling social

850
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,850
trust attacks internally I don't really

851
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,229
know what to call it I mean I've seen it

852
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,120
where we've targeted organizations

853
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,820
directly we've targeted employees of it

854
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,370
but we've never actually seen it where

855
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,840
yet where employees are being personally

856
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,330
targeted with their personal information

857
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,919
in order to compromise the organization

858
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,330
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

859
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,390
kind of walk through how do we breach an

860
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,230
organization with employee personal data

861
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,490
because most employees aren't really

862
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,389
trained on that right I mean you might

863
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,919
be trained on look

864
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,329
documents are not clicking links they're

865
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,459
looking at the red flag on the center or

866
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:18,289
whatever some of them the more versatile

867
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:20,929
or more technical savvy people might

868
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,609
look at email headers but we have now a

869
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,219
whole new type to different types of

870
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,139
attacks if we could solve the problem of

871
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:29,809
can we identify the employees which i

872
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:31,939
think is pretty much straight board and

873
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:33,229
can we identify relationships of the

874
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,299
employees this is really where it starts

875
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:36,859
to get really interesting and then what

876
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:39,229
about personal emails can we find

877
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,208
personal emails of the employees and so

878
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:42,799
the way we started going down this road

879
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,079
is the obvious way than what you're

880
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,918
identifying employees of an organization

881
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,629
LinkedIn I mean everybody goes to

882
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,570
LinkedIn we scrape LinkedIn employees we

883
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:51,829
generate these massive lists of people

884
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,149
or we'll go to Google and Bing if we

885
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:55,249
don't want to hit LinkedIn directly and

886
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:57,379
we'll say hey Google give me all the

887
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:59,779
employees that you know psycho and

888
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:01,908
Linkedin calm slash in and then in

889
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:04,639
double quotes the company name and it'll

890
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:06,409
get back a whole list of employees grab

891
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,478
the first name and last name of those

892
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:09,859
profiles that come up that's normally

893
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,849
what we would do but this time what we

894
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:12,529
want to do is we want take it a step

895
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:14,658
further we also want to grab the city

896
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:17,299
and the state of where that employee is

897
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:19,309
that at least general vicinity but

898
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:21,440
usually the city of states perfect what

899
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:23,989
we'll do from there we'll take that

900
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,459
email or that that first name in last

901
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:27,950
name will go to somewhere like hundred

902
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:30,679
i/o or rocket reach and it'll tell us

903
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,629
these are the format for this employee I

904
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,820
mean for this organization this this it

905
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:36,589
might be like first letter dot last name

906
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,079
or first letter last name at company

907
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:40,609
domain calm but we'll find that format

908
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,259
because by doing that and using a tool

909
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:43,908
that I think Bo wrote email address

910
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,129
mingler we could take the first name

911
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,469
last name and format and generate the

912
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:50,478
company email address more data right so

913
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:53,450
now we have lots of information we have

914
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:55,879
first name last name city state company

915
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,009
email portals in the days that it just

916
00:33:55,879 --> 00:34:00,978
gets more and more and more so what we

917
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:02,809
want to do now is we want to get PII we

918
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:04,789
want to get more personal information of

919
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,428
these employees we want the personal

920
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:09,500
email addresses of the employees we want

921
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,119
to know their relationships and what

922
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,759
I've learned in my research so far and

923
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,069
it's I hate it it's disgusting how big

924
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:17,839
this industry is but the people data

925
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:19,940
brokers industry is actually huge they

926
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,980
give you everything they buys they buy

927
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,899
cell they trade the data they give the

928
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,310
data for free you got places like true

929
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:26,480
people search com if you haven't

930
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,340
there you should go there and just do

931
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,990
yourself I put your name in your city

932
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,300
and state and see what comes up I

933
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,469
guarantee you're gonna find yourself if

934
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,520
you're not on the first page you'll

935
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,689
probably be on the first page if you're

936
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,780
not the only one depending on how you

937
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,250
unique your name is but what we end up

938
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,020
getting from that is we get all the PII

939
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,270
plus personal email addresses of those

940
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,530
people now I've seen people talk about

941
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,210
like well yeah but there's gonna be

942
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,770
people like John Smith in Tampa Florida

943
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,480
that's gonna be really common well yeah

944
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,860
it's gonna be common but you're also

945
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,260
gonna find a lot of people that aren't

946
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,640
common and the accuracy by using the

947
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,830
city state first name in the last name

948
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,569
is is really accurate like it gets deep

949
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:03,650
and down it gets so accurate that I

950
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,610
would talk about the next one in a

951
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,260
minute I put these slides in the wrong

952
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,240
order but this is a list of people sites

953
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,310
that I added a real quickly you want to

954
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,189
take a picture of this this is only the

955
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:15,230
top 15 I highlighted the very first one

956
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,450
in the beginning because in my research

957
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,500
I learned that all of these sites and

958
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,080
some of these are probably familiar to

959
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,230
you I like Pipil intelligence

960
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,360
they all use the same data so people

961
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,980
finders has sourced this data and it's

962
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,300
it's ridiculous I'm just showing you the

963
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,550
people data right now but it gets really

964
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,110
bad and they've aggregated it and

965
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,820
they've built an API around it and they

966
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,800
sold it and gave it away and traded it

967
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,990
to their partners and you have to go

968
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,160
through and kind of start opting out so

969
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,040
you want to take that screenshot I'll

970
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,629
release the slides too but but there's

971
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,700
more right so people finders also

972
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,350
grabbed business data consent like the

973
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,450
census data voter data criminal data

974
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,620
debt data eviction we always hear about

975
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,210
this we always hear about the data

976
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,890
collection we see the Cambridge

977
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:57,200
analytical using it with Facebook and

978
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,540
stuff but to actually see how bad this

979
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,310
people data industry is and coming

980
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,200
together is I got started to get me kind

981
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,880
of a little bit worried because the data

982
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,710
is just incredible now imagine this

983
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,900
going in the direction of targeting

984
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,980
somebody that's what we're gonna do the

985
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,330
first thing that we're gonna do is we're

986
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,310
gonna look at those personal email

987
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,750
addresses that we had well I think a lot

988
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,160
of people have this now the collection

989
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,330
number one through five from all the

990
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,700
database leaks where all the passwords

991
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,250
are decrypted and you have the email and

992
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,589
passwords right so what we do is we took

993
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,870
all of the company emails for all of

994
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,330
their personal email addresses for all

995
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,620
their employees and we reconciled it

996
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,180
with the password breaches I think we

997
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,560
have like 2 billion credentials in the

998
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,259
death in our database we have two

999
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,610
billion plaintext credentials then all

1000
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,440
we have to do is query on these email

1001
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,119
addresses and now we have

1002
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,490
all the personal passwords for all of

1003
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:44,619
the employees now a lot of people you

1004
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,000
reuse passwords I mean I I've reused

1005
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,230
passwords I know everybody in here is

1006
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,060
probably reuse passwords even if you

1007
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,160
don't want to admit it at one point or

1008
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,109
another and so you can imagine how this

1009
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,089
is going to start going and so when we

1010
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,410
reconciled it we're starting to now say

1011
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,660
okay well now we have the corporate

1012
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,098
email address and we have their personal

1013
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,810
passwords what if we just start reusing

1014
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:04,150
their password their personal passwords

1015
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,849
on their company email on the web

1016
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,339
portals and it's crazy bad it's just

1017
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,960
really bad across the board so and

1018
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:12,130
that's basically the first password so

1019
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,390
it's not really password stuffing

1020
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,619
because password stuffing is just taking

1021
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,359
a bunch of credentials and trying about

1022
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,920
a bunch of different websites it's not

1023
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,848
password brute-forcing because that's

1024
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,310
kind of like trying a bunch of different

1025
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:22,930
passwords it's also not really password

1026
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,060
spraying because I mean I guess it kind

1027
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,618
of is but you're not really spraying one

1028
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,089
password against all the users so it's

1029
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,349
really more of a so we called it a

1030
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:30,730
social trust attack I don't know what to

1031
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:32,319
call it but it's definitely not anything

1032
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,150
that's out there yeah and with with the

1033
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:36,099
multiple accounts right like so if a

1034
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,869
person has like let's say on average

1035
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,490
three to five personal email addresses

1036
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,660
or somewhere on there and we know about

1037
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,609
those we search those you know employee

1038
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,098
addresses right like your typical

1039
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:49,900
employee address they don't commonly use

1040
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,460
those on external websites you know most

1041
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,869
most people are smart enough to like use

1042
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,400
their public address or their personal

1043
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,980
personal address for that kind of stuff

1044
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,710
so the breach breach data has so many

1045
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,050
more personal account right then like

1046
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,310
your typical corporate email but the

1047
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,599
thing to consider is that all right so

1048
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,299
let's say we had like I don't know three

1049
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,819
thousand possible employees and each of

1050
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,230
those had three to five accounts and you

1051
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:12,880
know we found you know that each one of

1052
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,040
those accounts was compromised you know

1053
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,760
on multiple websites we don't have like

1054
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,290
a list of like password history across

1055
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,099
multiple accounts across multiple

1056
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:27,190
breaches and we can all start to like

1057
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,440
like craft customized passwords based

1058
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,450
off of what they've chosen on multiple

1059
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,040
websites right you know because

1060
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,480
obviously like you know not all websites

1061
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,540
have the same password policies your

1062
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,579
typical ad domain right but we need to

1063
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,160
be able to craft like your typical eight

1064
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,359
character you know upper case lower you

1065
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,098
know numbers just change the year

1066
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,900
exactly change the Year append the

1067
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:48,400
character that kind of thing season so

1068
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,530
there's a little bit of work there but I

1069
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,430
mean I I think I mean we're probably

1070
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,289
right on automate

1071
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,609
automated tool to do it you know yeah I

1072
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,410
think we're gonna move in that this was

1073
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:57,640
just a simple like proof-of-concept that

1074
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,618
I was actually when we were first

1075
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,379
starting down this road I wrote this

1076
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,430
little tool that basically it pulled you

1077
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,380
just passed in first name last name

1078
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,480
sitting at state and then it goes and it

1079
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,220
pulls all of the people data and then

1080
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,960
searches for all of those personal email

1081
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,490
addresses pulls all of them back and

1082
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,839
then queries all of the breach data and

1083
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,549
reconciles it just dumps all their

1084
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,380
personal passwords obviously we could

1085
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:18,788
take it a step further and we do it

1086
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,589
where we hit LinkedIn first on the

1087
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,150
company name but that's just connecting

1088
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:23,558
dots at this point but doing it from

1089
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,039
this perspective has been really really

1090
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,869
interesting so basically this is the

1091
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,029
attack path we find the portal scrape

1092
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,829
the employee name and information you

1093
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:34,900
know format the company emails scrape

1094
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,789
people's sites get personal passwords

1095
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,710
reconcile accounts and then just hit

1096
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,990
their portals with their passwords it's

1097
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,520
pretty straightforward

1098
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,868
so quit reusing passwords I mean that's

1099
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,400
I think we've been saying that forever

1100
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:46,930
but this actually drives the point home

1101
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,760
now because now we're seeing how much

1102
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,578
more success for having using personal

1103
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,900
passwords on corporate sites so there's

1104
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:54,160
the first one so the second one this

1105
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,510
other attack is kind of really

1106
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,680
interesting now because now we're

1107
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,539
getting to this point where we have all

1108
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,049
this information right so we have we

1109
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,730
know so much information so how can we

1110
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:06,038
start incorporating this personal info

1111
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,839
into the fish leveraging known

1112
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,599
relationships of people because we have

1113
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,339
relationships what if we doppelganger as

1114
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,960
an associate that you already know like

1115
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:15,990
imagine pulling your target employee

1116
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,150
pulling all of their relationships

1117
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,348
pulling all of your relationships

1118
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,819
relationships and then being able to

1119
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,200
tailor a fish and say hey did you hear

1120
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,730
what happened to so-and-so will you know

1121
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,049
they're gonna know that person because

1122
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,940
your doppelganger gang is somebody they

1123
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,349
already know and you both mutually have

1124
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,299
that associate that's already there and

1125
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:32,589
so now you can start targeting spear

1126
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:34,630
phishing attacks in social engineering

1127
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:36,849
attacks using personal information

1128
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,289
doppelganger as an associate in a way

1129
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:41,289
that's super automated where you could

1130
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:42,760
streamline it for 10,000 employees and

1131
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,440
the other cool thing with this is that

1132
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,210
it can come from a non corporate domain

1133
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,849
normally you're looking for you know

1134
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,839
fishes from at gmail and you're saying

1135
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:51,460
no I'm not gonna block that but if

1136
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,869
somebody hits you up personally and says

1137
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,660
hey you know what I try to hit you up on

1138
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:56,890
your old phone number but because you

1139
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,589
have that phone number as well you just

1140
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,788
fill it in the tool but I didn't hear

1141
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,869
back from you so I hope you don't mind

1142
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:03,099
me emailing on your corporate demand

1143
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:05,170
you're gonna be more likely and more

1144
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,849
suspect to follow through with the fish

1145
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,530
because it came from somebody you know

1146
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:10,630
with information that you that is

1147
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,960
accurate and so it's super

1148
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,339
personalizable this is a scary part of

1149
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,980
the personal data that I've actually

1150
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,450
been able to see and use in in

1151
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,220
spearfishing and social engineering

1152
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,450
assignment spearfishing anymore maybe

1153
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,890
spearfishing used to be like targeting

1154
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,868
one you know one person this is like

1155
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,900
spearfishing the entire organization in

1156
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:32,079
a customized way but all the names

1157
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:35,170
aliases previous names and dates so if

1158
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,109
you got married your previous name if in

1159
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,630
the date that you use those names so the

1160
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,980
dates of births we have do bees ages

1161
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,609
whether you're alive or whether you're

1162
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,040
deceased

1163
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:48,308
your current and previous address with

1164
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,690
dates and geo coordinated already so how

1165
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:51,339
long have you been at a specific address

1166
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,420
with a specific phone number we have

1167
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:54,940
that phone number that you used at that

1168
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,230
address as well and we know the telco

1169
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,730
provider that you used to use so if it

1170
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,680
was Verizon we knew that you use Verizon

1171
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,880
there we knew your neighbors and your

1172
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,440
neighborhood information if it was

1173
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,540
available in some sort of information

1174
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,490
and we we know all your personal email

1175
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,740
addresses which is really just that's

1176
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,209
like the part that I hate the most we

1177
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,589
know your relatives and the relative

1178
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,069
type we know if it's a spouse versus a

1179
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:17,799
son or a daughter your associates date

1180
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:20,109
of birth so if it's your your spouse and

1181
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:21,670
her birthday's coming up we know that

1182
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:22,960
her birthday's coming up we know your

1183
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,460
voter records we know which way you vote

1184
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,900
depending on the state I mean the

1185
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,490
majority of the states are that data is

1186
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,250
out there already you go to voter

1187
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:32,410
records comm it's public and we know

1188
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,299
employment history information so

1189
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,770
imagine all of this now it used to be

1190
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,940
just a figment we knew about this

1191
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,740
information but it wasn't highly

1192
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,440
accessible but these data brokers have

1193
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,759
made it available this is fast people

1194
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,349
search comm this is just one of them

1195
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,650
using the data this is Marshall Mathers

1196
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,000
like Eminem it's real like this is

1197
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,190
accurate ID ox people when I'm watching

1198
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,450
TV and just just pull them up and pull

1199
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,609
their Google Maps and I'm watching and

1200
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,779
walk in the same address it's crazy so

1201
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:56,859
you see this is the current address

1202
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,990
that's there these are the some of the

1203
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:00,670
phone numbers his emails I have his

1204
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:03,520
passwords on his accounts it's weird

1205
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:05,619
it's just weird stuff his relationships

1206
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,400
I'm Kimberly Mathers that's interesting

1207
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:11,500
Kim Possible associates business names

1208
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,530
it's all and it's all free I didn't even

1209
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,119
login I just went there and so that's

1210
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,220
just the kind of data that you're

1211
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,820
getting from all of this imagining this

1212
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,950
is

1213
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,080
for hyperbolic exaggerated personalized

1214
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,330
fish but hey first name and just start

1215
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,980
filling in the blank with these tools

1216
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,450
associate first name you know from you

1217
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,710
know from Lakeland or from Tampa I

1218
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,210
haven't talked to you since you lived

1219
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,190
over on that previous state name that we

1220
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,540
already know um so just imagine I mean

1221
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,460
this is just more of like giving you an

1222
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,990
idea of how you could target in a

1223
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,060
personalized way using the data that's

1224
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,850
relatively available in just a couple

1225
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,170
web requests so how do we start

1226
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,569
preparing and preventing this is kind of

1227
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,710
where it gets a little bit interesting

1228
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,060
so how do we reduce our digital

1229
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,470
footprint I mean is it a big deal I mean

1230
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,790
do you guys even care I mean you got I

1231
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,910
mean is it even a big deal for you I

1232
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,110
mean it is for me so I would say the

1233
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,910
first thing is watch out for personal

1234
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:01,180
emails at work I mean it if it's coming

1235
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,390
from somebody that you know you still be

1236
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,430
so be scared about that so you could

1237
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:10,810
also the interesting thing is um I got

1238
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:13,210
this from Bronwyn from sans she sent an

1239
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:15,370
email and it had that Vermont actually

1240
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,630
requires data brokers to register as

1241
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,430
data brokers if they want to conduct

1242
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,810
business in Vermont what that gives us

1243
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,359
is the ability to go to this site right

1244
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,340
here this Vermont data online search for

1245
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,190
business switch to data brokers and you

1246
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,930
get a list of like 120 right off the bat

1247
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,040
you can click on the their application

1248
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,240
and go to their opt-out and figure out

1249
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,650
how they do their opt-out but it's

1250
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,750
really hard you have to like goes like

1251
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,700
four clicks for each business click on

1252
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,280
the PDF read the PDF and then you figure

1253
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,140
out if it's a URL or if it's a form that

1254
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,760
you had to fill somewhere else or if

1255
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,410
it's a phone number so it's really

1256
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,520
difficult I think we're talking about

1257
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,109
aggregating this we're talking about

1258
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,060
manually going through this data and

1259
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,590
pulling it out and trying to find the

1260
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,790
best ways so that we could open it up

1261
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,790
and make it available so we could opt

1262
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,140
out of these databases or the other cool

1263
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:59,500
thing that you can do is you can become

1264
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,350
an Estonian resident and it sounds crazy

1265
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,270
but in Europe they have gdpr and in the

1266
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:05,980
gdpr they have an erasure clause and the

1267
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,660
erasure clause states that they have to

1268
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,610
delete your data and they have to notify

1269
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,870
the third party so that they could

1270
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,160
delete your data as well others I and

1271
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,560
they have to do it in a timely manner so

1272
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,600
this is where we're going but what these

1273
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,950
people dataset databases you know

1274
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,060
mirrored everywhere it's gonna be really

1275
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,439
hard before we actually get to that

1276
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,060
point

1277
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,260
so this is just kind of some of the

1278
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,020
steps that you could do in order to go

1279
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,480
in that direction that's all we had in

1280
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,950
the presentation I did add this little

1281
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,140
to little blog post at the bottom these

1282
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,359
are ones that I wrote earlier this week

1283
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,520
so ID platformed myself from from google

1284
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,900
and it was a really hard really long

1285
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,310
journey but the reason why I'm bringing

1286
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,510
it up here is because of the privacy

1287
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,400
aspect of it I mean it's really

1288
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,980
interesting to see if you really wanted

1289
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,090
to try to start consolidating your

1290
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,320
footprint and isolating yourself from

1291
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,000
all kinds of different services that are

1292
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,870
aggregating the data there's lots of

1293
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,160
stuff that you're gonna have to do

1294
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,259
especially if you're you know knee-deep

1295
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,549
in security with password managers and

1296
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,500
two-factor and all that so there's some

1297
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,700
cool steps in there and then you can

1298
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,950
follow us on Twitter we're gonna release

1299
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,810
Firefox I'm probably later today if not

1300
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,450
tomorrow depending on how much time we

1301
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:06,430
have so if you follow us or Black Hills

1302
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,439
will tweet it and you'll be able to see

1303
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:13,740
the the tool and be able to start using

1304
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,740
it immediately so any questions I guess

1305
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:25,060
no we're good is Firefox legal it's yeah

1306
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,820
I mean Firefox is a tool that's I mean

1307
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,230
it's only using the Amazon API so it's

1308
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,360
just a proxy that's what it was built

1309
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:34,240
for was designed for now whether or not

1310
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,800
using it to you know scrape the Internet

1311
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,720
if you're not abiding by robots.txt

1312
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,640
which I don't know if anybody does I

1313
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,709
don't know if the search engines do I

1314
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:45,549
would say I would say use it with

1315
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,350
robots.txt disclaimer just follow that

1316
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,420
as long as you're not Bing or Google and

1317
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:51,700
you'd probably be alright

1318
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,560
so scraping data I don't know if you

1319
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,540
have any questions we'd like to ask you

1320
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,759
to step to the microphones in the aisles

1321
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,070
and we'd also like to keep it short as

1322
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,700
we're now cutting into lunch time as

1323
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,470
well guys awesome stuff um I was curious

1324
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,509
what are the costs associated with the

1325
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:10,779
API gateway stuff like how many cars

1326
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:13,480
could you have purchased with here it's

1327
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,400
actually really cheap so I haven't seen

1328
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,320
the actual number like the decimal point

1329
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,570
of how many requests you get there are a

1330
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,340
few limitations like you can only I

1331
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:25,270
think it's you can only delete so many

1332
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:27,040
proxies in a specific time frame like I

1333
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,540
think it's like five per second so if

1334
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,880
you wanted to spin up like a thousand

1335
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,470
different URLs you could spin them up

1336
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,230
but you know deleting I might have to be

1337
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,819
you know slower but it's it's fairly

1338
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,140
true it's real each of you I mean it's

1339
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,340
just passing data to him from so it's

1340
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,770
really the bandwidth cost I had a

1341
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,100
question about the last one right there

1342
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,830
the

1343
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:51,730
resident how would that affect you with

1344
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:52,840
security clearances what did security oh

1345
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,960
that's a great question

1346
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,340
oh I'm sorry these clearances

1347
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,510
yes it's security clearances if you

1348
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,400
wanted a register so I haven't

1349
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:03,250
personally registered yet I may or may

1350
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,290
not have a Germany address and email and

1351
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,300
phone number and stuff I've been a

1352
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,430
little hesitant on that pull on that

1353
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,710
side so I don't know that that's

1354
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,790
probably something that the somewhere

1355
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,560
are more in the government sector that

1356
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,690
requires it might be able to give better

1357
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,630
advice without I don't have it sorry

1358
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,650
it's cool I could look it up though

1359
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,830
thank you I think that's it for

1360
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:29,770
questions well thanks everyone

1361
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:29,770
[Applause]
