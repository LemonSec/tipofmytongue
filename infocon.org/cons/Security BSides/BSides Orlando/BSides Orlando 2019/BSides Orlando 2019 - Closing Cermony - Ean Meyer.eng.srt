42
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,910
the folks up here and it wasn't just

43
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,709
today many of the people up here were

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,319
working on this for months

45
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,510
badges graphics

46
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,488
all kinds of stuff that goes into all

47
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,909
the little details that makes this such

48
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,049
a great day for everyone so next thing

49
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,358
here we want to talk about some feedback

50
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,219
I like doing this at the end of be sod

51
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:28,349
so we can say like hey we're listening

52
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,969
to you live so this is stuff that when

53
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,040
we do our after-action report and we

54
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,170
generally do a blog post to say hey this

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,590
is how we intend on getting better next

56
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,379
year

57
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,090
so at registration we moved away from

58
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,230
Eventbrite frankly because we were

59
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,930
looking at a system that could do

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,238
everything for CFPs and the whole kit

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,040
and caboodle QR codes really need to

62
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,560
come back for check-in so that'll help

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
speed things up a little bit we're also

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,889
gonna change a few things up probably

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,238
next year and you'll you'll see it all

66
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,069
we're really transparent about what we

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,689
do and and so other B sides can learn

68
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,540
because if we can learn a lesson they

69
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,719
don't need to then that's great more

70
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,000
tents oh this is amazing economy y'all

71
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,579
like soldering like you like hot metal

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,379
and Myint outside so great so we're

73
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,209
gonna add more tents we're and I think

74
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,939
the number we're gonna say is we might

75
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,739
even need to double again so we'll have

76
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,879
to actually talk to full sale if we end

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,220
up coming back here to be like how can

78
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,069
we do that but we'd love to do it if we

79
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,750
can so more food trucks I mean we wanted

80
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,189
to have two food trucks and like so the

81
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,079
unfortunate circumstance but maybe what

82
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:29,668
we'll do is we'll look at three that way

83
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,379
if when you know one ends up dropping

84
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,569
out we still have two we thought we were

85
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,849
good with two but will will definitely

86
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,578
work on that full so did a great job

87
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,589
manager I you guys didn't get to see the

88
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,669
amount of just responsiveness when there

89
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,620
was problems with the Wi-Fi and

90
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,290
workshops or whatnot I can't say enough

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,970
for the full sale network team for J for

92
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,280
all the folks just making sure when

93
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,409
there was a problem they were on it so

94
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,310
give them a quick clap by the way they

95
00:03:52,409 --> 00:04:00,599
were they were fantastic but what we are

96
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,849
going to look at is possibly doing

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,108
separate Wi-Fi for CTF workshops and

98
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,638
talks will will talk to the

99
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,949
infrastructure folks and see if that's

100
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,340
potentially a possibility and then a

101
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,959
longer check-in registration window so

102
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,310
again we grew by two hundred and sixty

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,709
people and you never know when that's

104
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,298
gonna happen so we're all glad you came

105
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,099
but we're maybe say hey if we're gonna

106
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,409
grow at that pace or at least have the

107
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,940
same amount of people that we will make

108
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,099
sure that we've got that window if you

109
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,240
did not get a chance to talk to us and

110
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,610
give us feedback

111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,440
besides Orlando org do not hesitate to

112
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,050
email us we'd like to hear your feedback

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,690
you should also expect to see an option

114
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,430
for a survey last year we did a $100

115
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,400
Amazon gift card because that seems to

116
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,949
entice y'all to tell us things all right

117
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,330
so watch out for that survey it's not

118
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,110
gonna be tomorrow cuz we're all gonna

119
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,060
nap and it'll be some time after we do

120
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,050
our own kind of after-action review

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,699
lessons learned etc so at this point and

122
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,020
I know you all want to see this get

123
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,720
given out so at this point I would like

124
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,669
to invite to the stage

125
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,150

b-sides for letting us put this on here

139
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:45,060
giving us a space and giving us the

140
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,099
infrastructure to support it it's our

141
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,259
fourth year doing it we've loved doing

142
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,810
it everybody has a good time building

143
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,060
the challenges and then coming out day

144
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,990
of and seeing tons of people compete in

145
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,759
it we had pretty full room for a good

146
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,000
portion of the day and then we had a lot

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,719
more people competing remote the what I

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,130
have up there is the graph of the top

149
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,560
ten teams and how they progress

150
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:15,560
throughout the day up until four o'clock

151
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,710
and the first-place team was sitting at

152
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,979
2600 and fifth was down to twelve

153
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,680
hundred and eighty a good spread but we

154
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,229
have 24 hours left for it to go or a

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,849

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,879
hundred and four users

160
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:49,690

161
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:51,940
those were in person yeah we've got 15

162

164
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:01,569

252
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,420
last few years is we've done in NVP this

253
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,640
is someone who has risen above and

254
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,870
beyond either through what they've done

255
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,390
through the time they've invested

256
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,080
through challenges etc and this year is

257
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,530
no exception

258
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,020
so this year our MVP conference award

259
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,880
through it goes to someone who dealt

260
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,230
with a mountain of email issues it turns

261
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
out we don't send you guys enough email

262
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,090
and so we have a neutral right we're

263
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,780
filthy neutrals and it go to spam and

264
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,740
just fighting that uphill left and right

265
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:25,189
communications challenge is to manage

266
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,190

269
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,920
have it on stage because I couldn't find

270
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,829
it back in the green room but this is a

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,969
custom trophy we had made because she is

272
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:50,990
our dragon tamer and it is a custom 3d

273
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:53,210

275
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,580
even begin to explain and we hope you

276
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,810

280
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,810
so there's more oh here it is

281
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,610
wonder if L it was gonna be I swear I

282
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,199
thought it was under the rainbow boa I

283
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:28,230
was like it's hidden under the rainbow

284
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:30,089
boa so there it is that is very cool and

285
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,690
honestly this is this is something that

286
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,250
we really believe in we put in a lot of

287
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,070
work for this and recognizing our own

288
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,350
and making sure that they know how much

289
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,630
we appreciate them is really important

290
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,740
to us so with that said we've got a

291
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,269
bonus MVP this year and and I didn't

292
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,860
really even discuss this with one but

293
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,970
one other board member but I'm doing it

294
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,600
because I've got the feather bow and

295
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,510
that puts me in charge so this years

296
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,279
bonus MVP award goes to someone who we

297
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,100

298
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,689
to this occasion and we and we have to

299

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,650
out under roles so there's things for

392
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,059
people who don't have a lot of time or

393
