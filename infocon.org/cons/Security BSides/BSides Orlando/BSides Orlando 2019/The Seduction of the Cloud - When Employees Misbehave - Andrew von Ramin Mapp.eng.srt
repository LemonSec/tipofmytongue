[Music]

25
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,450
you see what I have here it's advanced

26
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,479
technology what is it

27
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,420
flash drive okay I bet what you didn't

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,299
know is that I have your company's trade

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,740
secrets on here yep

30
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,310
it's kind of a long story but I'll tell

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,979
it to you anyways this sales executive

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,020
that I know she left your company and

33
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,250
she wanted to go work for a competitor

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,460
better benefits better salary more

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,470
commissions and so she decided that

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,199
there were some documents that were of

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,270
value to her and quite interesting and

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,580
so she decided to grab those documents

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,750
and download them from the corporate

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,519
intranet onto a Dropbox account and she

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,420
took those documents with her all

42
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:19,620
confidential trade secrets of the sales

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,160
process and procedures and she asked me

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,480
if I wanted a copy of it so I said well

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,090
sure why not

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,149
it's actually quite some interesting

47
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,620
stuff on here especially when we're

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,310
looking at the unique content for the

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,470
actual sales process and how your

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,560
company is actually acquiring new

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,890
clients and it's quite interesting and

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:57,870
unique approach does anyone else want a

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:03:01,018
copy of it yeah so yes but seriously one

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,079
of the biggest issues that we have when

55
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:09,060
it comes to protecting our corporate

56
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:11,940
data is not only protecting our data

57
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,000
from from adversaries but also

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:21,569
protecting our data from employees that

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,940
potentially have ill minded thoughts

60
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,530
about what to do with the with the data

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,840
and I would go so far and to argue that

62
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:34,489
the number one threat to your

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,379
cooperation or your organization's data

64
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:44,099
are not nation state attacks with zero

65
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:47,629
day exploits it's not script kiddies

66
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,750
that are exploiting some old

67
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:54,989
vulnerability that wasn't patched mana

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,489
fact I would say it's not even

69
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:02,640
ransomware but it's the actual threat

70
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,810
from within now given all of these

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,420
components certainly are threats that we

72
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:14,099
need to watch out for and threats that

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,649
we need to combat but too often the

74
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,159
threat from within is neglected and we

75
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,388
put almost all of our eggs in one basket

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,810
in fighting off the adversary fighting

77
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:32,030
off the the evil hackers and leave

78
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,889
ourselves relatively vulnerable to

79
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,830
simple insight threats and we're not

80
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:42,360
speaking necessarily about a

81
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,669
sophisticated IT individual that is able

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,139
to cause a lot of havoc in the

83
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,310
organization but we're talking about

84
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,440
your average employee maybe at a

85
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,840
management position or so in in sales

86
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,900
and business development that has access

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,940
to information that they need to have

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,599
access to for their day-to-day business

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,919
operations but if they were to obtain

90
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:10,110
and exfiltrate that data and share that

91
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,570
with a competitor or sell it off it

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,380
would cause some tremendous issues to

93
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:19,370
the to the organization so my point here

94
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,450
is that the threat from within is

95
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,990
something that should not be neglected

96
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,719
and we need to pay more attention to

97
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,740
that particular we've been seeing a

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,680
strong increase of data theft by

99
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,870
employees and that's really what we're

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,400
going to cover here so we're gonna jump

101
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,919
right into the to the presentation and

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,830
when we're talking about data theft I'm

103
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,799
particularly going to focus on data

104
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,969
theft the

105
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,400
the cloud because we've seen a huge

106
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,000
spike in this type of activity

107
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,549
over the past three four years and there

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,580
is just something something about the

109
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:10,479
cloud that makes it so so seductive for

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,340
employees to grab some data and just

111
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,469
transfer it on to their personal cloud

112
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:20,198
storage device so the reason I'm giving

113
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,789
this presentation or to give you a

114
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,789
little bit background about myself first

115
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,270
I'm originally from Germany been here in

116
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,280
Orlando now for about 15 years or so

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,008
I've run two companies a data recovery

118
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,109
company and a cyber security company

119
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,479
called cyber centers where we

120
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,530
predominantly work with law enforcement

121
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,110
agencies we work with law firms

122
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,508
corporations and and municipalities and

123
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,560
we've assisted in some high profile

124
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,870
investigations here in the state but

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,870
well I'm really here today is to talk to

126
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,319
you about the data theft that we've been

127
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,520
seeing in a drastically increasing

128
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,449
number of incidents in in our

129
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,068
investigations when we've been assisting

130
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:14,919
clients so why am i doing this you know

131
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:16,569
it's a dirty job but someone has to do

132
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,500
it alright no one wants to talk about

133
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:22,569
well what is if employees are stealing

134
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,060
information you know I don't want to

135
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:29,020
stand up here and make employees out to

136
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:33,029
be the bad guys because 99.9% of all

137
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,710
employees are hardworking and our

138
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:40,060
ethical and would never do such a thing

139
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,960
but it only requires one and that one

140
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,889
incident that can be crucial and

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:52,599
devastating so just imagine for a moment

142
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:55,830
from a business perspective if an

143
00:07:52,599 --> 00:08:01,659
employee let's say in a sales department

144
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:04,630
copies off a list of clients and

145
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,880
potential clients and takes that to the

146
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,700
competitor and that company all of a

147
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,700
sudden starts losing about 50% of its

148
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,219
client base that is something that could

149
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,780
bring the company to its knees and can

150
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,730
bankrupt the company or at least

151
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,919
best-case scenario it'll take the

152
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,220
company years to recover from that

153
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,020
versus from a cyber breach of course

154
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,120
depending on how severe the cyber

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,409
breaches and what was involved but often

156
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,099
times you can hire a a skilled public

157
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:43,900
relations firm to assist with media

158
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:47,080
control and PR damages to try to improve

159
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:51,010
the situation and the persona of of the

160
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:59,280
company again so let's jump right into

161
00:08:51,010 --> 00:09:04,660
this so what do we see more frequently

162
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:08,350
than threat actors and this is when

163
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,540
we're investigating corporations we're

164
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:17,320
investigating with municipalities does

165
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:20,020
anyone have an idea well it's the threat

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,510
from within I mean the theme that that

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm covering here so data breaches by

168
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,800
employees oftentimes that have

169
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,430
additional permissions that they

170
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,140
shouldn't have to the network folders

171
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,489
databases things of things of that

172
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,330
nature the Verizon data breach report

173
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:45,670
and it made a study and determined that

174
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:48,160
77% of all data breaches either occurred

175
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,199
from the inside or had an inside

176
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
component attached to that so while

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,720
we're focusing all of our efforts on

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,900
shielding the network from the outside

179
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,820
adversary oftentimes we find that we're

180
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:05,199
not doing enough to shield ourselves

181
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,160
from from within so some of this what it

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,050
actually includes

183
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,400
when we're looking at data breaches from

184
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,260
would in it includes access that is

185
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,510
granted

186
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,030
that is not restricted sufficiently

187
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:22,240
which not only includes employees but

188
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:26,400
also includes contractors we're talking

189
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,960
about copying of trade secrets that

190
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,170
sometimes have been copied without

191
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,150
intent and we're talking about copying

192
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,209
of trade secrets and intellectual

193
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,110
property with the intent of and when we

194
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,870
say here with intent so it intent for

195
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,080
nefarious activities so copying trade

196
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:50,700
secrets without the intent can be a

197
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,010
scenario such as a software developer

198
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,870
copies a piece of code he or she doesn't

199
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,819
really have any plan on selling it to a

200
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,460
competitor or doing anything with with

201
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,340
it but that individual just thought it

202
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,880
was a cool piece of code and wanted it

203
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,110
for their own collection versus with

204
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,560
intent at that point we're talking about

205
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,840
causing harm to the organization or

206
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,239
doing it with the intent to have

207
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,480
financial gain by selling it off

208
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,060
starting an own company going to a

209
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,200
competitor with that information to

210
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,689
assist a competitor in in in causing

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,140
havoc to that organization and removing

212
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:40,780
its its clients so we've identified

213
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:43,210
basically three key employee types where

214
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,170
we're seeing these type of issues pop up

215
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:49,570
over and over again and of course

216
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,430
there's going to be some other areas but

217
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,560
from our investigations this is kind of

218
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:59,500
covered 98% of it and that is mid to

219
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,280
senior level Sales Executives which has

220
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,010
pretty much been the bulk then business

221
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,500
development executives and then third

222
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:13,120
but not least software developers and

223
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,190
made in senior level sales executives

224
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,460
oftentimes they will focus on grabbing

225
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,470
client lists potential client lists

226
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,190
sales procedures price lists and things

227
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,380
of that nature

228
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,910
with business development executives

229
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,340
it's oftentimes very similar

230
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,980
and then software developers obviously

231
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:37,450
some type of code that either they wrote

232
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,070
themselves but on company time and the

233
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,930
code belongs to the organization or

234
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,720
someone else wrote the code in the

235
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,410
organization and they wanted to have

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,090
that piece of code for for their own use

237
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:54,630
now one interesting fact from our

238
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:59,800
investigations is that in probably about

239
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:02,920
95 cases or 95 percent of the cases it's

240
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,689
been all by males so we've seen very

241
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:10,270
little employee data theft by by females

242
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:16,330
so take that for for what it is don't

243
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:18,670
hire any more men right okay so why do

244
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:23,230
we see such a drastic increase of

245
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:26,140
employee data theft and the reason is

246
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,290
it's become very easy to copy off data

247
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,810
from a corporate network or a cloud

248
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,969
platform and it's been relatively

249
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,459
difficult to combat because

250
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:42,270
realistically when you're trying to

251
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:46,560
oversee hundreds or thousands of

252
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:50,620
employees it becomes very difficult to

253
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,439
micromanage the data access and even if

254
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,900
you do have seams and platforms in place

255
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,870
to do that oversight oftentimes just

256
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,689
just happens because everyone is so busy

257
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,760
working on projects and deadlines and

258
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,390
there's just hundreds or even thousands

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,270
of employees to do so there's four main

260
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,960
areas of data exfiltration and when we

261
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,630
refer to data exfiltration that's the

262
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:20,260
terminology basically for data theft

263
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:23,350
where we're exfiltrating data from where

264
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,160
it is to where it should not be so

265
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:30,370
there's four main components of how data

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,630
is exfiltrated the first one being cloud

267
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:37,270
services second one being USB thumb

268
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,700
drives the third one being webmail

269
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,170
attachments and then transfer to

270
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,570
smartphones

271
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,599
some of these is more are more easier to

272
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,320
combat than than others for example USB

273
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,170
thumb drives a good approach there

274
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,250
obviously is just disabling the access

275
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:01,329
to the USB ports webmail attachments

276
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,209
having proxy servers or firewalls that

277
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:09,459
block out webmail altogether while not

278
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:11,859
100% foolproof is gonna combat at least

279
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:15,630
90 percent or more so what we're really

280
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,339
going to focus on here is cloud services

281
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:23,439
and when we're talking about cloud

282
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:34,660
services we're referring to client base

283
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:37,360
cloud services pardon me can everyone

284
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,719
still hear me okay so we're talking

285
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,000
about client and consumer based cloud

286
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,209
services so in this instance we're not

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,910
we're not talking about the Amazon Cloud

288
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:55,899
or we're not talking about any cloud

289
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,209
hosted servers but essentially container

290
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,720
buckets that are freely available to

291
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:05,199
anyone to use such as Google Drive

292
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,529
onedrive Dropbox Box com mega etc etc

293
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,920
and since these are popping up

294
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:14,860
everywhere and are freely available and

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,740
accessible everyone can it can basically

296
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:25,570
create an account and can copy data onto

297
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:29,350
them and that's really and that's really

298
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:34,120
the issue with that that it's become so

299
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:36,160
accessible that is just starting to

300
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,320
become very seductive and we're seeing

301
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:45,300
more and more of that and so to go back

302
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:49,839
to that the reason why it's becoming so

303
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,870
seductive and interesting is from a

304
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,670
perspective of committing a crime

305
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,920
there's a few things that

306
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,420
usually have to come together to really

307
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,610
make it enticing

308
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,619
I mean you always have some people that

309
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:07,210
are just nefarious by by nature or been

310
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,179
so a long time and will look for any

311
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,810
opportunity to commit a crime but that's

312
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:16,660
not the majority of of people and if you

313
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,290
study any type of criminal statistics

314
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:24,220
that's not the majority of what happens

315
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:28,060
the the average person is just like you

316
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,990
and I that lives an average life and

317
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:34,360
tries to uphold their their their their

318
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,590
ethics and you know be a good server sir

319
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,080
be of good service in the community

320
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,470
etcetera etcetera but when certain

321
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:46,320
things come together that's often time

322
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:50,200
when there is somewhat of a catalyst to

323
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,970
commit commit a crime and those

324
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,610
components are usually four components

325
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,400
one being something actually happened in

326
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,550
that individuals personal life such as

327
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,340
an issue with a relationship a financial

328
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:08,649
issue a health issue something that

329
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:12,639
causes this person to panic and act out

330
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:16,440
of their normal circumstances the second

331
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,320
being there has to be some type of a

332
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:26,440
platform or some type of a device or

333
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,230
tool that's easily accessible if you're

334
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,580
thinking about committing a crime and

335
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,380
the tool that you need to do it's gonna

336
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,500
cost you two and a half million dollars

337
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,010
then you're probably going to not do it

338
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,300
and go back to read a book or something

339
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:44,610
but if those tools are readily available

340
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:48,399
and they're cheap or even better free

341
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:52,929
then that becomes enticing the third

342
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,630
component is it needs to be easy and if

343
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,780
something is very complicated it's

344
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:02,800
usually going to deter you so if it's

345
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,700
cheap or free and it's easy for you to

346
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,899
utilize and the third component really

347
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,580
being

348
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,680
that there is a high chance that you

349
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,560
actually can get away with it or think

350
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:20,340
you can get away with it if these four

351
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,340
components come together it causes a

352
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:30,580
huge catalysts and individuals that

353
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:32,830
sometimes are prone to conducting

354
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,919
certain behaviors that that they

355
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,720
shouldn't can easily be persuaded not

356
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,730
even necessarily by others but by their

357
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,310
own mind to engage in these type of

358
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,920
actions

359
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,690
so most employee terminations when we're

360
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,620
looking at data theft from that

361
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:54,580
perspective what we're seeing in terms

362
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,639
of how data theft really happens in in

363
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,250
the real world is that cloud service

364
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,660
accounts are not being disabled properly

365
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:08,550
or not being disabled on time or someone

366
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:12,940
forgot to disable the cloud accounts CRM

367
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:16,149
platform such as Salesforce again are

368
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,850
not being disabled sometimes the user

369
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,520
access is not being disabled or the user

370
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:26,590
had too much access and was able to

371
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,970
export data entries client names client

372
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,760
lists things of that nature that they

373
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,100
shouldn't be able to do and then the

374
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,260
other component that we don't see as

375
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,230
frequent but surprisingly we do see it

376
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,870
happen is that someone forgot to disable

377
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,810
the VPN access so usually someone in IT

378
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,060
forgot to disable the VPN access for an

379
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,090
employee that was terminated turret

380
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,550
employee finds out oh my VPN is still

381
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:55,629
working let me just try and connect and

382
00:20:51,550 --> 00:21:01,030
see what's there so let's jump into some

383
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:04,540
case studies here we were contacted a

384
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,480
while ago by an international

385
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,290
corporation about the high level sales

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,780
executive that had left the company and

387
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:18,070
went over to pretty much their main

388
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:21,330
competitor now this company they were

389
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,408
pretty certain that this

390
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:28,379
key employee in in their sales division

391
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:30,450
had to have taken some information from

392
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:33,840
the corporation and shared it with their

393
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,610
with their competitor however they did

394
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,320
their own internal investigation and

395
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:43,139
they weren't able to find anything of

396
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,840
substance or any type of evidence to

397
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:49,559
really back that up the reason why they

398
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,389
were so concerned and the reason why

399
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,759
they so strongly felt that the employee

400
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:55,889
had taken information was because in

401
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,100
that particular geographical region

402
00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:01,320
which was a very high profit region for

403
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,109
them they were starting to lose clients

404
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,389
left and right so while they weren't

405
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:09,869
able to prove it at the time they felt

406
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:12,269
very very strongly that somehow the

407
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:15,840
employee had to have taken some client

408
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,970
databases and client lists with him so

409
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,178
we ended up having a conference call

410
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:26,720
with that organization and after we

411
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:29,399
spoke to the CIO and the general counsel

412
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,090
basically the chief legal officer of the

413
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:37,408
organization we took on the case and we

414
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:40,289
saw it an investigation first we didn't

415
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:42,090
find anything we've pretty much we're

416
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,529
looking at the same results that they

417
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,699
were looking at from internal

418
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:50,489
investigations right basically we were

419
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:56,249
just looking puzzled into the headlights

420
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:58,440
like a pack of deers but then then

421
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:01,559
something was revealed to us by the

422
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:06,960
corporation and that is that the sales

423
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:09,330
executive had two laptops one which we

424
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,869
had already investigated and didn't find

425
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,720
anything whit and in a second laptop

426
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:19,259
which conveniently he took with him

427
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,919
after termination and did not turn over

428
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:26,249
that second laptop until after an audit

429
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,869
four weeks later they figure it out wait

430
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:31,109
a minute we were missing a laptop here

431
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:33,990
who has it oh it was the sales executive

432
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:35,129
that left and reluctantly he turned it

433
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,960
over

434
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:41,620
so once we got our hands on that laptop

435
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,350
and we investigated it we actually

436
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,050
started finding some things that looked

437
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:51,990
a little bit more interesting we started

438
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,990
seeing logs such as this right here

439
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:02,320
anyone know what we're looking at here

440
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,720
okay so essentially we found logs that

441
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,659
showed in the event log that that

442
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,970
individual was establishing a VPN

443
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,970
connection back to that company and

444
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,080
obviously that was after the time that

445
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,620
he was already terminated and he should

446
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,699
have not been authorized to connect to

447
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:27,070
the the corporate network nevertheless

448
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:31,630
he did because the VPN access was not

449
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:34,899
disabled and not only did he connect but

450
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,170
he also downloaded the documents that

451
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,490
were in question several PDF and Excel

452
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:45,220
spreadsheets that had client databases

453
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,530
potential clients high-profile clients

454
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,550
and projects that they were bidding on

455
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:55,030
and so he did take that information to

456
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:59,830
the competitor so it was very

457
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:03,300
interesting and what we found out in

458
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:08,110
addition to that that really was

459
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:10,149
somewhat unique is that when we tried to

460
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,550
look from the corporate perspective and

461
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,160
look at the corporate network logs and

462
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:17,919
on the corporate side we didn't really

463
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,160
find any of that information so we were

464
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,340
looking for basically the second

465
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,620
component we had a connection from the

466
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,050
laptop that we could see but we were

467
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,389
looking on the corporate side to also

468
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,940
see those logs so that we can ensure

469
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,610
that they fit like perfectly like like a

470
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,680
glove and that from an investigation

471
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:42,159
standpoint that was going to be very

472
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,620
solid however that component just wasn't

473
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,720
there and one of the individuals that

474
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,489
was assigned to assisting us on the

475
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,680
corporate side

476
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,200
was making it very difficult for us to

477
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,780
try to get any logs and made it very

478
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,150
difficult for us to get any type of

479
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:01,060
information and just prolonged and

480
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:04,330
prolonged and prolonged until we spoke

481
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,060
to the IT director and found out that

482
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,860
those logs were not there

483
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,860
we ended up having the IT director grab

484
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,750
those logs from some tape backups and

485
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,850
provide them to us and we ended up

486
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:23,050
finding the previous logs that confirmed

487
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,240
the VPN connection and essentially what

488
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:29,159
we found out by further investigating

489
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:38,880
was that not only were those logs

490
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:41,110
deleted but but anyone knows any ideas

491
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,380
there is more that's right there's

492
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,429
always more but what we found out was

493
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,800
that the employee in the IT department

494
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:54,520
part of the the network admin group that

495
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:58,750
was responsible for disabling the VPN

496
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:02,110
axis went ahead and actually purged the

497
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:05,110
logs and knew that the connection was

498
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,760
established and he was so concerned that

499
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,310
someone was going to find out and that

500
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:14,500
he was going to get terminated that he

501
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:17,440
disabled or basically purged all access

502
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,810
logs on their current seemed that

503
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,430
related to to that time period and

504
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,110
needless to say it made the

505
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,500
investigation a whole lot more difficult

506
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:32,679
and more time-consuming and more costly

507
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,960
etcetera etcetera and in the end the

508
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:39,010
employee in the IT department was

509
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,570
terminated for that action versus if he

510
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,920
would have just been upfront he probably

511
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,720
would have gotten a slap on the wrist

512
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,720
and you know be more clear for next time

513
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,990
so we have another case study that we're

514
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:56,590
gonna cover and this time it was a

515
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,240
fortune 1000 company that had contacted

516
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,320
us to investigate a contractor of theirs

517
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,830
they found so

518
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,168
log showing that the contractor was

519
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,879
doing something fishy something weird

520
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,460
was going on there that they were

521
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,159
certain of but they couldn't quite

522
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,240
confirm their suspicions their

523
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:24,130
suspicions were that the contractor was

524
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:28,779
downloading contracts and proposals and

525
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:32,230
bids that relate it to a very different

526
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:35,980
project and his employer would have been

527
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,610
able to basically see the scope see what

528
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,049
the competitors had proposed and

529
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,479
essentially outbid all of the

530
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:46,000
competitors by having that that internal

531
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,720
information now they did their own

532
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,929
investigation they captured a bunch of

533
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,610
pcap logs but it was all SSL and TSL

534
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:58,120
traffic so they really couldn't do

535
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,370
anything with it and they spoke to us we

536
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,449
said we can take a look at it

537
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:09,750
and so we did we took a look at the peak

538
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:14,340
app captures and initially when we did

539
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:19,570
we didn't find anything of value again

540
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:22,059
because the traffic was encrypted now

541
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:24,279
what we ended up doing we grabbed the

542
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,830
laptop and in this instance we really

543
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,480
had a lot of luck we grabbed the laptop

544
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,408
that that contractor was using at the

545
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,710
time and there was a hibernation file

546
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:41,019
and in that hibernation file we did a

547
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:44,519
raw recovery for the session key that we

548
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:50,649
then used in Wireshark to essentially

549
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:52,299
decrypt the SSL packets and we started

550
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:54,668
seeing things like this I don't know if

551
00:29:52,299 --> 00:30:05,399
you can see it from here but this says

552
00:29:54,669 --> 00:30:10,629
here 19 - oh 3 RFP - proposal a one - km

553
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:13,658
c0f twelve PDF and we found a whole

554
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:16,090
bunch of these and we correlated that

555
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:18,730
these were actually proposals

556
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:23,620
were real and belonged to the client and

557
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:26,650
those were accessed from a box calm

558
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:30,669
account this particular organization was

559
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:32,710
using box comm to provide access to all

560
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:36,070
of their contractors for different

561
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,290
projects and this individual had

562
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,679
additional access that for some reason

563
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:46,180
he should not have had and he had access

564
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,210
to an additional folder that somehow by

565
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,130
accident an oversight he should have had

566
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,040
access to that because it was for a

567
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,080
totally different project but it was a

568
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,590
project that his organization was

569
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,510
involved it and it was I think it was

570
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,490
like a fifty or a hundred million dollar

571
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:07,840
project so it was by no means a

572
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:12,400
small-scale project and it ended up

573
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,010
becoming a very big investigation and it

574
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,830
actually was a big thing that was

575
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,360
covered and all of the other contractors

576
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:23,500
ended up finding finding out about it

577
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,570
and they all wanted a rebid of the

578
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,290
proposals and so it ended up being a

579
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:31,540
night mirror for that organization the

580
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:35,260
other thing that we found out which was

581
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:39,850
interesting is that not only did he

582
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:43,750
download these files from a box cop

583
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:46,659
voxcom account but further he actually

584
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:52,420
utilized those files and transferred

585
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:56,640
them from one cloud storage container to

586
00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:00,490
the next basically he did cloud hopping

587
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,920
to try to prevent from someone finding

588
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,310
out who actually ended up taking those

589
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:10,630
documents so he downloaded that

590
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:15,149
information and he uploaded it from box

591
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:19,050
comm to Dropbox and then from Dropbox

592
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:22,030
ended up transferring it to mega and

593
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:25,600
then from mega we don't exactly know

594
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:29,500
where it went but in the end we found

595
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,010
out that when he ultimately downloaded

596
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,210
it again

597
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:38,350
on to his personal laptop he did it

598
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:41,170
through a Google Drive account so we had

599
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:44,770
the information for the from the Box com

600
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:47,140
that led us to Dropbox and we ended up

601
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:50,710
getting some subpoena assistance and

602
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,180
were able to trace the IP addresses for

603
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,680
Dropbox and then that led us back to

604
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,230
mega-mega was not cooperative so we

605
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,620
didn't find any more information that

606
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:07,260
was that was helpful however at that

607
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:10,899
point we had sufficient probable cause

608
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,629
to get a a subpoena of the individuals

609
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,390
personal laptop and we ended up finding

610
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:20,530
those same exact files being downloaded

611
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:24,180
by a Google Drive account and so he

612
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:27,700
ended up hopping from box comm to

613
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,250
Dropbox to mega possibly to a few more

614
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,510
all in trying to evade that he was the

615
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,730
individual that was trying to download

616
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,920
that information then transferred it

617
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,640
over to Google Drive and downloaded it

618
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:42,730
to his personal laptop so it was quite

619
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,940
sneaky in in that approach so that's

620
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,470
pretty much the conclusion those two

621
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,560
case studies and what I really wanted to

622
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:53,230
leave you with and drive home is that

623
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:58,030
when you go back to to your companies

624
00:33:53,230 --> 00:34:01,630
and organizations on on Monday speak to

625
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:07,480
everyone on the IT staff and conduct an

626
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:09,700
a proper audit on not only the security

627
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,240
permissions that you have on on your

628
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:17,609
network for employees but also where is

629
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:21,879
the the hot data create a data map that

630
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:25,929
not only affects information that's

631
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,659
pertain to compliance such as HIPAA and

632
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:32,139
PCI so we're not just talking about the

633
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,450
credit card information and sensitive

634
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:38,050
user information but we're talking about

635
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:40,509
from a business operations create a data

636
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,090
map if it isn't already in place where

637
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,929
the data is that would be of the most

638
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,289
hard

639
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,539
if it were to if a competitor were to

640
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:51,700
obtain that information and then

641
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:54,549
backtrack who has access to that

642
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:56,498
information and how well is that

643
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:58,839
information currently being protected

644
00:34:56,498 --> 00:35:01,919
and try to reverse-engineer that

645
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:05,769
situation where someone on the IT team

646
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,690
will take one of the sales accounts for

647
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:10,660
example and see how much information

648
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:14,529
they can actually get out same with

649
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:18,538
laptops that that are taken home or

650
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:22,029
off-site do a proper audit on that and

651
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:25,950
hopefully that'll inspire your

652
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:29,980
organization to drive home the fact that

653
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:33,308
not only external data threats are are

654
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,220
big and growing concerns but internal

655
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:39,430
data threats by employees and data

656
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,129
exfiltration are just as much if not

657
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,348
even a bigger security risk at the

658
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,650
moment and it's just going to continue

659
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:51,039
to grow and continue as we're seeing

660
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,720
more cloud accounts bigger free storage

661
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:56,410
spaces and things of that in their

662
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:02,519
nature all right do we have any

663
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,519
questions yes sir

664
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:15,010
okay so the first case study what really

665
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:18,069
caused somewhat of a big delay was that

666
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:20,860
we needed to wait to get those backup

667
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:25,120
tapes restored and we literally had to

668
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,130
wait about a month for that everything

669
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,390
else in the investigation took about

670
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:33,160
three weeks so you know nearly two

671
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,740
months with the delay that we had to

672
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,490
wait on these backup tapes of being

673
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:49,709
restored

674
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:49,709
yes sir no out

675
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:16,569
ah good question and yes so for example

676
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,900
there should be a proper for example the

677
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:24,400
second watch though the first case study

678
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:28,560
with the the bpn issue policy-wise there

679
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:34,330
should be a proper procedure for

680
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:38,020
employee termination and whoever is

681
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:40,299
essentially managing that should check

682
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,370
off all the boxes and then sign that it

683
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,220
has been conducted so that usually is

684
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:50,470
the best way from my experience of doing

685
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:54,009
it so it would be disabled Active

686
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:57,609
Directory account check disabled CRM

687
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:03,580
database check terminated VPN account

688
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:09,790
check sign John Doe in terms of the the

689
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:12,850
second one I would say a frequent audit

690
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,380
of user permissions and what we see

691
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,960
often times is that everything is fine

692
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,080
inside of the network but when theta

693
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,750
gets moved out of the network in cloud

694
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,210
storage containers for some reason it's

695
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:32,050
kind of out of sight and out of mind and

696
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:35,770
it's not treated as as organically as as

697
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:38,520
part of the entire whole data set and so

698
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,950
often times when you're doing

699
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,110
vulnerability assessments audits things

700
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,990
of that nature it's kind of just pushed

701
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:50,830
to the side not included or or forgotten

702
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:53,729
so a a audit on permissions of any type

703
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:56,650
of cloud storage platforms that you have

704
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,390
probably would have prevented that or it

705
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:02,440
wouldn't have prevented the initial

706
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:05,020
oversight but it would have found the

707
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,130
issue in terms of permissions and it

708
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,390
would have probably been able to be

709
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,430
rectified prior to to the incident any

710
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,170
any other questions yes sir if I can

711
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,669
interrupt for just one quick moment if

712
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,190
you have a question could I ask you to

713
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,570
come to the aisle microphone so that as

714
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,290
we're recording we can catch your

715
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,980
questions as

716
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,160
well on the second case with the

717
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,930
contractor what controls did were

718
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,210
neglected by the by that company that

719
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,859
could have could have prevented that was

720
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,380
should they have been sandbox in the

721
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:41,740
contractor more yes so is essentially

722
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:44,380
the contractor had permissions to an

723
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,720
additional folder hierarchy that he

724
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:51,670
should not have had access to so it

725
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:55,810
should have been sandbox to folder XYZ

726
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:59,800
for project one two three and that was

727
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:02,470
not the case and it was a bit

728
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,350
interesting because that contractor had

729
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:09,669
worked on different projects at times

730
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:12,190
and for my understanding he actually was

731
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:16,420
working on two different projects

732
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:21,520
simultaneously so somehow that obscured

733
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:25,690
his entire permission access but still

734
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:29,410
it should have been sandbox yeah any any

735
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,990
other questions yes I have two questions

736
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,870
mm-hmm one are you hiring because I'm

737
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:36,879
less likely to sell secrets and to do

738
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:40,089
you guys give like remediation reports

739
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,830
say if you find a port open that you

740
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,840
know shouldn't be open even though it

741
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:47,370
wasn't parked in the investigation do

742
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:51,280
you put that in your final report or

743
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:54,040
such things like that well so simple

744
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,470
answer is yes yes and yes yes we

745
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,680
actually are hiring yes you're probably

746
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,740
not gonna steal any data and yes we do

747
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,440
provide information on remediation

748
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:07,689
however sometimes oftentimes depending

749
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,700
on what type of investigation on what

750
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,240
we're doing for doing like a penetration

751
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:16,390
test or something security related then

752
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,709
we definitely have remediation in the

753
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,790
case of when we're doing an

754
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:24,450
investigation for employee data theft or

755
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,500
things of that nature if we do provide

756
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,020
remediation steps it's usually a

757
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:33,400
separate report because the first report

758
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:37,120
oftentimes is utilized in in the lawsuit

759
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,700
or even in in in a criminal legal case

760
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,759
and so that information shouldn't really

761
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,750
be in that particular case we provide

762
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,660
that separate thing but yes I have a

763
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,430
follow up on the contractor situation

764
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,330
what are there any legal ramifications

765
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:57,160
and the reason I ask that is if that

766
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:59,200
individual is were to go to a different

767
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,940
company would something show up in a

768
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,680
background check because most companies

769
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,380
do a proper background check right

770
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,819
Alicia would hope so but would that show

771
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,430
up or would there be any legal

772
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,830
ramifications yes there are there were

773
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,720
legal ramifications and for my

774
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:19,600
understanding they're still ongoing is

775
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:22,240
it's a complex the whole it's a big

776
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,120
organization and the big contractors the

777
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,600
complex things so it sometimes gets

778
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:31,839
drawn out for a long time but yes there

779
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,360
there is an investigation more than

780
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:40,720
likely that individual will have a

781
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:43,000
record thank you thank you how do you

782
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,520
deal with chain of custody for cloud

783
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,020
services can you elaborate on that a

784
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,470
little bit more Adria is there anything

785
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:55,390
specific that you're so if if you want

786
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:58,810
to prosecute somebody in court I'm

787
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,690
assuming you need to bring evidence is

788
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,420
there are there any chain of custody

789
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,700
elements that need to be adhered to

790
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,470
Pacific to cloud services essentially

791
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,669
it's no different it's not much

792
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:15,910
different than than any other forensic

793
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,920
investigation so once the data has been

794
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,830
identified there has to be a chain of

795
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,440
custody as and who's the individual who

796
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:26,020
essentially obtained the data and then

797
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,410
anyone else who's working on examining

798
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:34,420
or analyzing the data will have to sign

799
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:37,839
a proper chain of custody form so in

800
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:41,290
most of those cases a there isn't

801
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:44,920
anything required from the from the

802
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:47,440
actual cloud hosting provider but it

803
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,270
starts with whoever identifies and

804
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,170
collects the information so in other

805
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:59,110
words if I identify the information in

806
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,850
in the cloud and I download it and I

807
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,090
hand it over to one of my employees for

808
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,339
investigation I would sign off on that

809
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,190
then that individual would sign off on

810
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,110
that and then if we hand it over to an

811
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:13,870
attorney then that attorney would sign

812
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,880
off from that until it ultimately makes

813
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:20,380
itself into the hands of law enforcement

814
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,950
or into into a courtroom now usually if

815
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,660
there is a subpoena process in place

816
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:28,540
usually we'll start the chain of custody

817
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,790
then with with the the subpoena process

818
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:34,330
so in that case if we do need to

819
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:36,759
subpoena a cloud service provider then

820
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:43,690
the chain of custody starts right there

821
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:48,420
with John Doe at box.com or whatever it

822
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:52,720
is that release that information yes sir

823
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:54,010
um so a lot of these cloud providers you

824
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,020
know some of them are better than others

825
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,730
right Google Drive for example you have

826
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,470
granular permissions you can lock it

827
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,240
down you can prevent personal accounts

828
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,459
by the law but there's a lot of them

829
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,830
that you know don't really have this

830
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,540
stuff built in and as there's hundreds

831
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,400
and hundreds of these like cloud and SAS

832
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,740
providers that like become ingrained in

833
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,260
company's business processes like what's

834
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,819
a good strategy to help lock that kind

835
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,650
of stuff down if the provider doesn't

836
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,510
natively provide that functionality cuz

837
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,910
it's really the only reason Google Drive

838
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,950
works away it does because Google does

839
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,109
that they have that functionality built

840
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:30,310
in but a lot of them don't so what do

841
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:33,150
you do right well so um a lot of the

842
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:36,250
bigger ones now they actually have

843
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,930
enterprise accounts where you have to

844
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,540
pay a little bit more and then you

845
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:44,470
actually have a lot more ability to lock

846
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:47,410
down and an audit is not although I

847
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:51,299
don't really want to promote it onedrive

848
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:54,129
is a good one in in that instance and

849
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,890
that you can tie everything nicely back

850
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,390
together so best practice there is

851
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,270
probably going with one of the bigger

852
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:06,839
providers like

853
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:09,630
Google Microsoft right right and some of

854
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,490
them you can also whitelist or blacklist

855
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,220
your IP addresses or IP address ranges

856
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,810
and I think we're almost done but we

857
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,580
probably have question and we may have

858
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:22,110
time for maybe one more question and

859
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:27,420
then any other questions I can take we

860
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:29,400
can questions in the lobby now we can

861
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,260
okay okay I'm a student and I'm in

862
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,510
digital forensics too now and we've

863
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,460
talked about cloud computing and it's

864
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:38,040
difficult to know I wanted to understand

865
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,650
how did you go from box comm to Dropbox

866
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,150
to mega without a subpoena or did you

867
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,160
have a subpoena to get to all those

868
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,780
cloud services to acquire that data

869
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,029
because you're not allowed to get that

870
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,390
so how did you do that or how long did

871
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,270
it take you to do all that well from

872
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:56,420
box.com that was the the corporate

873
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:59,580
account so we had access to that and

874
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,140
when it was copied over to Dropbox we

875
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,840
actually did get a subpoena for that and

876
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,259
then mega we did not get a subpoena and

877
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,000
that's why we lost the trace there

878
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,760
because not sure where there's two hosts

879
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,460
it if it's in New Zealand or or where it

880
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,530
is at this point but usually subpoenas

881
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,430
you'll have a lot more success with

882
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:22,820
anything that's in in the US or in the

883
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,819
EU

884
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:33,070
