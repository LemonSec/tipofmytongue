1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,680
let's switch to our defender rule and

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,110
explore the attack from the soft point

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,440
of view in the Microsoft defender ATP

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,829
portal located at security Center dot

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,810
windows.com Microsoft Defender ATP

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:20,030
applies correlation analytics and

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,369
aggregate or related alerts into one

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,290
incident entity allowing the sock

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,660
analyst to understand and deal with

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,820
complex threads across the organization

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,950
with the right visuals as we see here

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,260
let me select this incident and then

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,810
open the incident page you can see in

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,349
the incident page all alerts related to

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,480
this incident all machines involved

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,150
investigations evidence and graph here

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm at the alerts page reviewing the

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,280
incident alert lists and Falls that

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,280
progression of the attack from this view

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,440
you can dive into individual alerts you

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,390
can also see all machines affected by

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,809
this attack here we have three machines

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,540
for example with high security risk the

24
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,640
graph is also a great visualization that

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,090
shows all machines involved in this

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,950
attack and all entities involved so for

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,530
our machine we can see there is a

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,470
PowerShell script involved and you can

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,200
see the hash value of that script the

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,590
script creates a scheduled task to

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,080
persist after reboots here is also the

32
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,000
office word process that starts the

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,310
whole attack when a user opened the

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,490
infected word document and finally you

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,140
can see executable file or backdoor that

36
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,140
was dropped from the infected word

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,770
document now let me go to the demo three

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,110
machine and as you can see each machine

39
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,590
protected by Microsoft Defender ATP has

40
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,950
its own page on the machine page you can

41
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,100
see different sections like alerts

42
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,049
timeline security recommendations

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,020
software inventory and discovered

44
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,689
vulnerabilities you can see also the

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,298
risk level of that machine the logged on

46
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:04,250
user and basic information about the

47
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,490
machine like the domain membership and

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,800
operating system information let me open

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,290
this alert as we try to reproduce how

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,930
the attack took place the alert is a

51
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,810
PowerShell dropped a suspicious file on

52
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,019
this machine

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,840
you can see the process 3 here we have

54
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,700
the Windows Explorer L process and the

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,180
word document that triggers the

56
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,569
powershell script now that script the

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,450
two things drops a backdoor and creates

58
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,399
a scheduled task as you can see here you

59
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,619
can also go deeper and see the full

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,540
PowerShell script that was invoked on

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,390
that machine and the hash value of that

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,510
script you can also see the hash value

63
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,399
of the backdoor file and this is useful

64
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,030
if we want to search if the same

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,860
backdoor exist on other machines now if

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,109
you want to know more details about this

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,109
scheduled task that was created by this

68
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,180
attack to persist after reboots you can

69
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,120
see here the comment used to create a

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,970
scheduled task by the malware this is so

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
powerful I will go to the alerts page

72
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,560
again and let's open this alert

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,559
suspicious PowerShell command line and

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,900
as you can see you have the same process

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,090
three and even a nice graph of showing

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,489
all entities related to this PowerShell

77
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,829
here you can see the same PowerShell

78
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,380
script is invoked on a machine called

79
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,169
demo one which is so important to know

80
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,530
not only we discover the attack but now

81
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:34,290
we can reimagine how it happens and what

82
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,480
machines were infected I will go now to

83
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,760
the machines timeline to get more

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,910
details about all events happening on

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,130
that machine to ease investigation here

86
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,680
you can see each and every process

87
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,230
activities recorded for every machine

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,230
for example you can see we have the

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,608
office click to run executable

90
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,069
establishing a connection to a remote IP

91
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,950
you can see the command line that was

92
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:02,119
run the hash of the executable and the

93
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,459
remote IP URL and even the port number

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,400
now let me filter the timeline for alert

95
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,169
related events and we now have a

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,599
filtered view of all suspicious

97
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,019
activities in that machine including the

98
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,760
suspicious PowerShell command line and

99
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,849
to show you how this is a powerful thing

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,789
let me filter the view and search for

101
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:26,280
PowerShell you can see immediately I can

102
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,409
see all events and suspicious activities

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,080
that involves PowerShell on the

104
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,570
machine so for example I have a partial

105
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,940
created a script and the behavior is

106
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,330
document exploit and we have the

107
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,370
Windward that exe created the process

108
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,849
powershell here we have the context

109
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,520
which is the user called master now we

110
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,740
know that the word document created a

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,349
process called powershell dot exe which

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,690
invoked app suspicious powershell script

113
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,880
that dropped a backdoor and created a

114
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,890
scheduled task now that you learn how

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,320
this attack took place it's time to take

116
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,810
some actions I will go to the incident

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,969
section and open the incident page for

118
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,120
this attack you can see I have the

119
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,490
action and assistant section here I can

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,710
resolve the incident or assign the

121
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,990
incident to me so that others in the

122
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,330
sock team can acknowledge that I will be

123
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,790
investigating this one before conducting

124
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,609
the investigation however it's good idea

125
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,740
to look at the reports dashboard it

126
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,320
provides high level information about

127
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,290
alerts and machines related information

128
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,390
generated in your organization the

129
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,250
report includes strengths and summary

130
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,919
information on alerts and machines

131
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,300
knowing the trends and summer is related

132
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,030
to others and machines in your

133
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,669
organization can help identify where

134
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,309
focused improvements can be made for

135
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,620
example if you see a sudden spike in a

136
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,050
specific kind of alert you can drill

137
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,870
down and start investigating directly

138
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,150
from the relevant code to pivot into the

139
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,550
alert or machine cue with the relevant

140
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,370
filters applied and determined what

141
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,690
action to take to address an issue

142
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,820
finally I want to show you one of my

143
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,400
favorite tools to help you investigate

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,219
incidents remember that the infected

145
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,950
word document was found on the machine

146
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,160
that drops a backdoor executable and

147
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,099
invoked a suspicious powerful I can copy

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,040
the hash of the word document and use

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,680
the search bar to see if this word

150
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,250
document exists on any of my other

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,740
machines doing that gives me more

152
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,930
information about this document like the

153
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,300
digital signature and hash values and

154
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,000
whether this document was seen on other

155
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,610
organizations globally to give you more

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,280
insight

157
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,080
if this is a targeted attack or not you

158
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,239
would also get alerts related to this

159
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,580
document and the most important part is

160
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,669
you get a list of machines with

161
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,729
Microsoft Defender 80 pcs that filed a

162
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,799
new organization in this case we have

163
00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,250
three machines where this word document

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,409
get dropped this is important for you as

165
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,539
a security professional because it's not

166
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:07,509
just mitigating the threat on one

167
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,818
machine but you really want to see if

168
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,490
this attack spread to other machines and

169
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:15,849
then cover all infected machines during

170
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,440
your investigation before we end up this

171
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,280
demo let me show you another interesting

172
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,229
feature called automated investigation

173
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,690
Microsoft Defender ATP can start an

174
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,878
investigation and automate a lot of

175
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,729
actions without human interactions and

176
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,940
using machine learning here you can see

177
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,159
Microsoft defender ATP recognizes a

178
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,169
dangerous tool called mimic at running

179
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,300
on one of my machines and it

180
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,719
automatically started an automated

181
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,330
investigation for me if you watch one of

182
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,940
the famous crime-scene investigation or

183
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,159
CSI TV series you know that

184
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,669
investigators at the crime scene start

185
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,639
by gathering evidences and ask witnesses

186
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,440
to learn more about what just happened

187
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,810
this is the same thing we have here

188
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,360
under the investigation graph we have

189
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,120
the dead body which is the machine or

190
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,310
machines list we have the witness list

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,889
people who might know more about this

192
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,800
crime and in our case we have the

193
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:20,199
entities analyzed so Microsoft Defender

194
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,580
ATP is investigating 2342 files 150

195
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,849
processes in this machine 262 services

196
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,979
and couple of drivers and the TV series

197
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,019
the investigator will look at the list

198
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,838
of phone calls made by the victim before

199
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:37,390
the crime happens and hear Microsoft

200
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,539
Defender ATP is investigating the list

201
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,179
of IP addresses this machine talked to

202
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,730
during that period and all this

203
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,719
investigation to all these entities is

204
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,240
finished after 45 seconds only by

205
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,440
defender ATP this is a true power of

206
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,770
autumn

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,790
we have the list of alert part of this

208
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,600
investigation

209
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,640
list of machines infected a view of all

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,339
entities involved in this investigation

211
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,199
as you can see we have three thousand

212
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,020
four hundred twenty entities involved

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,790
here and the investigation log which is

214
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,220
list of action

215
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,680
Microsoft Defender ATP talk during this

216
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,410
investigation and we have one pending

217
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,880
action that defender ATP asked me to

218
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,610
confirm before closing this

219
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,189
investigation I already approved this

220
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,640
pending action which is to quarantine

221
00:09:27,190 --> 00:10:19,480
