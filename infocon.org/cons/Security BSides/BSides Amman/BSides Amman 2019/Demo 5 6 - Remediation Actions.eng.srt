1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,560
in part five of this demo we are going

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,780
to explore Microsoft Defender ATP

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,018
remediation actions like running

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,289
antivirus can restrict app execution and

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,750
isolate machine these can be considered

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,450
your mitigation and containment tools in

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,640
your incident response management I am

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,860
at the Microsoft Defender ATP management

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,530
portal and I can see I have many alerts

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,630
in the active alerts section I can find

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,390
all machines at risk here so I will

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,600
check on the demo 3 machine to zoom in

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,670
and see what's happening on that machine

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,180
here you can get the risk level of the

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,210
machine and all associated alerts in the

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,210
bar above you also get list of actions

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,310
you can do remotely to that machine as

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,980
part of the investigation or response

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,410
process you can remotely initiate an

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,319
anti-virus scan to help identify and

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,809
remediate malware that might be present

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,660
on a compromised machine you can select

23
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,849
the scan type that you'd like to run you

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,700
can choose between a quick or a full

25
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,970
scan I will type a comment and select

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,130
yes to start the scan now immediately

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,039
the Action Center shows the scan

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,408
information as you can see here now on

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,680
the machine itself you can see that the

30
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:24,110
scan completed successfully returning

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,150
back from the Microsoft Defender ATP

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,280
management portal perspective the

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,860
Machine time line will include a new

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,960
event reflecting that a scan action was

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,299
submitted on that machine Windows

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Defender Av alerts will reflect any

37
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,810
detection that surfaced during the scan

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,860
this action is available for machines on

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:49,070
windows 10 version 1 709 or later a

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,619
Windows Defender antivirus scan can run

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,229
alongside other antivirus solutions

42
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,470
whether Windows Defender AV is the

43
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:59,479
active antivirus solution or not so say

44
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,970
for example you have Symantec AntiVirus

45
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,549
running on that machine and you are not

46
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,100
using Windows Defender anti-malware or

47
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,409
real-time scanning you can still invoke

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,900
a remote antivirus scan from Microsoft

49
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:14,000
Defender ADP portal and this will wake

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,070
up the Windows Defender and team

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,220
our engine if it is not the primary

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:22,519
anti-malware service on that device and

53
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,460
asked it to run a quick or full scan

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,800
depending on your choice in addition to

55
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,990
the ability of containing an attack by

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,690
stopping malicious processes by running

57
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,330
an anti-virus scan you can also lock

58
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,570
down the device so that only programs

59
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,420
and executable signed by Microsoft are

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,310
allowed to run on the device and

61
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,130
anything else will be blocked this

62
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,170
method of restriction can help prevent

63
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,390
an attacker from controlling compromised

64
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,450
machines and performing further

65
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:56,660
malicious activities so let us restrict

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,450
app execution on the machine I will type

67
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,090
a comment and select yes restrict app

68
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,429
execution now immediately the Action

69
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,550
Center shows that the app restriction

70
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,440
comment is bending as I am running on

71
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,720
the machine itself you can immediately

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,359
see what the user can see on the machine

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,010
I get a notification that the device is

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,989
restricted along with a message

75
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,480
explaining what is happening on that

76
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,580
machine remember that this action only

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,340
prevents any program not signed by

78
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,440
Microsoft from running on that machine

79
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,049
so the user can open Microsoft Office

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,260
applications without any problems and

81
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,600
even browse the web but if the user

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,768
tries to install anything that's signed

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,959
by Microsoft

84
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,900
like for example installing Adobe Reader

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,750
for example this action will be blocked

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,239
along with a notification explaining to

87
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,340
the end-user what just happened this is

88
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,610
a good balance between security and

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,950
usability from security perspective we

90
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,410
are restricting executing malicious code

91
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,988
but from the other side the user can

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,329
open Outlook Excel and communicate using

93
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,820
Microsoft themes for example so that he

94
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:07,220
can still be productive while security

95
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,350
teams investigating the problem now

96
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,090
depending on the severity of the attack

97
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,950
and the state of the machine

98
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,560
you can choose to reverse the

99
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,358
restriction of applications policy after

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,010
you have verified that the compromised

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,409
machine has been remediated

102
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,900
and you can see the action appearing in

103
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,450
the action center which becomes the hub

104
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,520
of notification for all action

105
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,219
performed on that machine so we can

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,400
track back all actions performed by you

107
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,760
or anyone in the security operation team

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,549
over time now that the app restriction

109
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,980
is removed we can try to install Adobe

110
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,530
Reader on the machine again and as you

111
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,200
can see there is nothing preventing you

112
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,690
from doing so now just keep in mind that

113
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,560
for the app restriction to work you need

114
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,469
two things

115
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,520
first you need to be running Windows 10

116
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,650
version 1 709 or later and this feature

117
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,349
is available if you are using Windows

118
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,539
Defender antivirus as your malware

119
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,760
engine now depending what the severity

120
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,650
of the attack and the sensitivity of the

121
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,990
machine you might want to isolate the

122
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,280
machine from the network this action can

123
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,380
help prevent the attacker from

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,270
controlling the compromised machine and

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,270
performing further activities such as

126
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,330
data exfiltration and lateral movement

127
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,859
this machine isolation feature

128
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,320
disconnects the compromised machine from

129
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,900
the network while retaining connectivity

130
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,570
to Windows Defender ATP service which

131
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,159
continues to monitor the machine so your

132
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,849
machine will not be able to connect to

133
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,060
any IP except the IPS of the Windows

134
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:43,220
Defender ATP cloud services so that you

135
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,960
can keep an eye on what's happening on

136
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,770
that machine and continue your

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
investigation

138
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,310
now if the machine is running Windows 10

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,710
version 1 709 or later you get another

140
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,740
cool feature you can do a selective

141
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,599
isolation which means you can say this

142
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,900
machine is not allowed to connect to any

143
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
IP except three services number one is

144
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,429
the Microsoft Defender ATP cloud

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,370
services the second one is the exchange

146
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,590
online services and third is the Skype

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,770
for business services as you can see

148
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,020
here this means you don't want the user

149
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,450
to be able to do anything on the machine

150
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,280
in terms of network connectivity except

151
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,770
using Outlook and Skype for business

152
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,840
which makes it easier for the user to

153
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,030
contact the help desk or the other way

154
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,190
around it is easier for the security

155
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,640
team to contact the user of the machine

156
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,230
using Outlook or Skype for business

157
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,780
explaining to him what is happening now

158
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,040
if I choose to isolate the machine the

159
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,719
end user of the machine

160
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,180
we'll receive a notification card

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,520
stating that the network is disabled and

162
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,200
that your IT administrator has caused

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,840
Windows Defender to disconnect your

164
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,870
device and you should contact IT health

165
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,780
disk now just a reminder the full

166
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,140
isolation works for Windows 10 version 1

167
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,570
703 or later while the Selective

168
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,289
isolation is available on Windows 10

169
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,360
version 1 709 or later selective

170
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,700
isolation means the machine can only

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,130
talk to Microsoft Defender ATP cloud

172
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,130
services and allow the user to use

173
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,020
Outlook and Skype for business now

174
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,640
depending on the severity of the attack

175
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,990
and the state of the machine you can

176
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,240
choose to release the machine from

177
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,800
isolation after you have verified that

178
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,160
the compromised machine has been

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,160
remediated

180
00:07:28,310 --> 00:08:16,149
