1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,319
attacks that introduce file-based man

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,619
were using socially engineered emails

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,629
are quite common recipients are tracked

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,820
into launching a back door that gives

5
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:17,939
that hackers control over what is now a

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,300
compromised machine now this demo

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,369
simulates that attack simulates the

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,099
attack that are launched using a

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,679
socially engineered word document in a

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,630
spear phishing email the attack is

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,110
designed to ensure that the receiver

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,350
does not suspect a thing and opens the

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,200
document the document however is rip on

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,080
eyes dwith crafted macro code that

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,290
silently drops and loads an executable

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,410
file into that machine the executable

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,500
then writes a registry key and creates a

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,949
scheduled task both commonly known Auto

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,340
Start extensible points after the attack

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:03,080
finishes we can explore and understand

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,840
how Microsoft Defender 80p detects and

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,689
respond to the attack and enables prompt

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,579
investigation and response let's pretend

24
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,798
that this machine is a Windows machine

25
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,439
of a user who received this Word

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,600
document it could be delivered to him by

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,148
email a chat window or by any other

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,818
means now when the user opens that

29
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:26,009
document he sees this tempting yellow

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,560
bar in the top to enable editing and

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,960
then of course there is that macro bar

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,590
that users cannot resist and they feel

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,839
they need to hit that enable content a

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,880
few seconds later a hidden PowerShell

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
script is launched from this documents

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,818
malicious macro and it performs the

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,310
following actions first that macro drops

38
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,859
an executable file which represents the

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,530
backdoor onto the desktop folder then

40
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,359
the scape goes on to create a scheduled

41
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,209
task to launch the backdoor at a

42
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,729
predefined time and finally when the

43
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,069
backdoor is launched it creates an auto

44
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,170
start entry under the registry run key

45
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,990
allowing it to stay P resistant by

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,420
starting automatically with Windows you

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,459
can also see that Microsoft Defender 80p

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,679
detects what's happening and this is

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,690
where we will continue the demo by law

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,930
on to the Microsoft Defender ATP

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:03:04,750
management portal

52
00:02:17,930 --> 00:03:06,810
