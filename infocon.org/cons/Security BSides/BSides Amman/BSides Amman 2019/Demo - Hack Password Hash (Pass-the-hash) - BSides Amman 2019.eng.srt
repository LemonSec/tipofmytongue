1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,390
attackers love passwords and we ask

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,389
security professionals hate them for

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:14,389
their weaknesses and end-users either

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:17,419
write them down share them or use weak

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,460
passwords that can be easily guessed but

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,100
attackers are not after your password

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,950
anymore they can do the same damage by

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,050
only knowing your password hash the bad

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,890
news is that windows keep all password

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,540
hashes in a protected area in memory if

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,149
attackers can hack into that protected

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,610
area they can access password hashes for

13
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,040
every account using that Windows machine

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,530
not only your password you think this is

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,960
bad wait till you learn that attackers

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,570
can use these hashes to connect to

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,090
remote resources also using pass the

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,739
hash technique and this is how attackers

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,290
move inside your network usually

20
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,260
undetected now do you want to see all

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,180
this in action I'm sure you do so in

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,430
this demo I'm going to show you how to

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,188
hack into this protected area in memory

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,470
and get access to all these hashes we

25
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,630
talked about to make this demo more

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,939
interesting we're going to steal the

27
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,929
hash of the local administrator account

28
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,818
and pass that hash to a nearby Windows

29
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:20,149
machine and gain access to sensitive

30
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:22,899
information this is known as passed the

31
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:25,700
hash technique so let's start our demo

32
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:28,069
let me start by opening a command prompt

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,840
and verify what account I'm using and

34
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,029
whether it is a local admin on the

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,429
machine or not you can see that I'm

36
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:37,729
running under an account that is member

37
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,529
of the local administrator group now let

38
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:42,020
me quickly clean the screen and browse

39
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:45,259
to my tools folder and I want to find

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,048
the tool called mini cats which is the

41
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:50,329
number one forbidden tool by Microsoft

42
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,119
and there is a good reason for that

43
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:56,208
this tool dumps password from memory as

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,270
well as hashes now let me run the tool

45
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:02,090
and clean my screen and I will start by

46
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,419
attaching it to a debugger by typing

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,669
privileged debug you can see I get an

48
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:10,579
error but don't worry this is

49
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:12,849
intentional the reason is I need to run

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,129
the command prompt with elevated rights

51
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,149
so let me quickly open a command prompt

52
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,060
with run

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,129
administrator browse to my tools folder

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,459
and run mimikatz

55
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:29,239
again now I will try to type the same

56
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:32,180
comment debug privilege and you can see

57
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,090
the common run successfully now this is

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,030
possible because by default the local

59
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,540
administrators group has debug privilege

60
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,209
which we can quickly verify by opening

61
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,670
the local group policies console browse

62
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,639
to Windows settings security settings

63
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,138
use the right management and then search

64
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:56,000
for debug programs here you can see that

65
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,549
administrators have the right by default

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,760
and you can see that assigning this

67
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:04,099
right can be a security risk now let me

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,649
go back to mimikatz and now I will

69
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,959
enable logging so that any output

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,159
generated by this tool will be locked in

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,150
a text file as you can see here now here

72
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,849
is where the magic starts I will type

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:23,449
secure Elysee Elysee stands for local

74
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:27,560
security authority so secure Elysee and

75
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:30,379
then logon passwords fall to dump the

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,079
hash is stored in memory for every

77
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,569
account who logged onto this machine now

78
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,290
all what you see here in the screen is a

79
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:42,290
memory dump of all passwords in memory

80
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,959
here is my user Hammad and you can see

81
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,720
different type of hashes for my password

82
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,120
stored in memory and available to me

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,579
using this tool and this is what allows

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,040
Windows to any real single sign-on in

85
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,049
the first place so that I don't need to

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,948
type my password each time I access

87
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,530
network resources

88
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,680
that's why Windows Store password hashes

89
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,010
in memory the most interesting part is

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,139
the ntlm hash of my password now let us

91
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,078
try to find another password hash is

92
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,930
stored in memory just for fun and as you

93
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,440
can see there are a lot of them here is

94
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,769
an account called l3 admin which is

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,820
level 3 admin it seems one of the level

96
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,039
3 engineers

97
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,380
locked on to this machine perhaps to

98
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,719
solve a problem and we can see the ntlm

99
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,950
hash for this account available for us

100
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,020
let me try

101
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,719
to open the loop file and search in the

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,630
loop file just for clarity and try to

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,970
find other password hashes specifically

104
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,700
the password hash for the local admin on

105
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,460
this machine which is called the master

106
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,070
account we can see the domain is demo

107
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,739
one which is the name of the Machine and

108
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,680
this mean this is a local user and here

109
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,660
is the ntlm hash of the master account

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,240
which is the default locale

111
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,520
administrator on that machine I will

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,070
copy that hash and open a new notepad

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,370
and paste the hash there for our next

114
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,870
step later in this demo we will use this

115
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,140
hash to connect to another machine

116
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,690
called demo 3 using my account which is

117
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,719
Hammar I don't have access to connect to

118
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,360
a demo 3 machine which is a nearby

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,540
machine in fact let me prove it to you

120
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,580
very quickly I am using PS exec to

121
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,640
connect to demo 3 and you can see I

122
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,460
don't have admin rights on that machine

123
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,310
but if I am lucky enough the local admin

124
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,669
password of my machine and demo 3

125
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,410
machine is the same password and since I

126
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,600
have the hash of the local admin

127
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,720
password in my notepad I can use

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,180
mimikatz to have a functional command

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,420
prompt using the context of the local

130
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,030
admin just by passing the hash you can

131
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,930
see the full command I use in mimikatz I

132
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,710
type secure LSA then the username as

133
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,080
master the domain name as localhost

134
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,020
since this is a local account and the

135
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,020
ntlm hash I got earlier in my notepad

136
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,280
now you can see I got a new functioning

137
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,280
command prompt window

138
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,250
let me put both windows next to each

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,590
others the left side window is running

140
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,390
under my account hamad and the right

141
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,969
side window is running under the

142
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,950
built-in admin account

143
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,860
now the confusing part is when we type

144
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,590
Who am I on both windows I would expect

145
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,870
the result to be master in the right

146
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,810
side window which is the local admin

147
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,230
account but don't worry this is just how

148
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,730
things work with these tools to prove it

149
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,620
you remember my account could not

150
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,870
connect to demo 3 machine as

151
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,449
see here again now on the right side

152
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,250
window you can see I'm using PS exit

153
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,010
again to connect to the monthly machine

154
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,590
and the tool is taking time to establish

155
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,900
a remote session on day one three using

156
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,659
the master account password and since my

157
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,750
machine and demo three machine both have

158
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,090
a local admin account called master with

159
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,050
the same password this command should

160
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,299
work and bypassing the hash I have now a

161
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,770
functional command prompt on a remote

162
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,870
machine if I type hostname on both

163
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,930
terminals you can see on the left side

164
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:24,169
the hostname is demo one and on the

165
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,410
right side the hostname is demo three I

166
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:30,530
can even browse the file system on the

167
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,380
remote computer locate a secret folder

168
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:37,719
and access the credit-card information

169
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,719
data machine accomplished

170
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,260
what you can learn from the demo is that

171
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,360
the debug privilege is very risky

172
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,370
privilege you should use group policy to

173
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,590
prevent anyone including administrators

174
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,870
to have such right unless you have

175
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,090
specific needs

176
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,160
also your users should not be admins on

177
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,890
their machines they should be running

178
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,490
under a normal account and perhaps use

179
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,620
another separate admin account as we saw

180
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,170
in the demo we used the hash of the

181
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,050
local admin account to connect to a

182
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,140
remote machine because the local admin

183
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,490
password is the same across all machines

184
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,590
you should always make sure to have

185
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,350
different local admin passwords across

186
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,659
your machines and to do that you can use

187
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,690
the solution from Microsoft called

188
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,100
local administrative password solution

189
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,360
or labs

190
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,670
8 PS also as a best practice you should

191
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,130
have your admins working with two

192
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,650
machines one machine to access email and

193
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,320
browse the web and a separate machine to

194
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,059
perform highly privileged tasks this way

195
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,820
if a malware was delivered through the

196
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:46,400
web or email it cannot do much damage

197
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,460
because your admins are using separate

198
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,740
machine for admin tasks now one of the

199
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,750
two machines can be a virtual machine

200
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,060
and there is a great solution from

201
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,540
Microsoft to implement that it is called

202
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,510
the privileged admin workstation that I

203
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,490
encourage you to look at finally you can

204
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,030
disable the local admin and the guest

205
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,890
accounts on all machines just in case

206
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,510
here are some good references for you to

207
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,340
learn more about some tools and

208
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,340
technologies we talked about so far

209
00:09:15,900 --> 00:10:05,239
