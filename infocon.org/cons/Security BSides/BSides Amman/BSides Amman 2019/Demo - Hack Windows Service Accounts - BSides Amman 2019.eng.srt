1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,920
I will talk about the number one finding

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,290
in any penetration test and one of the

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,080
easiest way for an attacker to

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,480
compromise your whole network it is like

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,950
giving an attacker a priority pass or

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,460
the keys to the kingdom

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,230
saving him both time and effort did you

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,770
guess what I'm talking about

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,180
it is the nightmare for any security

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,830
professional to have a window service

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,859
running under the domain administrator

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,930
account in almost every organization

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,180
there is a service running under the

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,729
domain admin account or at least other

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,370
highly privileged account this is

16
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,220
usually your backup service that needs

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,099
to backup all the files including sequel

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,409
databases exchange services and Active

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,510
Directory you know I work in big

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,640
organizations and they always here the

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,379
backup team saying we need to run the

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,470
backup shop under the domain admin

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,390
account to backup the Active Directory

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,400
but a better way is to run a schedule

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,069
task in one of your domain controllers

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,859
and that schedule task will be running

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,559
under the local system and it invokes a

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,109
PowerShell script now that partial

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,689
script will take a backup of your Active

30
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,449
Directory and copy the backup files a

31
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,908
remote secure file share whether your

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,340
backup software can then go and take

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,310
backup of these files without the need

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,439
to expose you to main admin account

35
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,259
another examples and scenarios where the

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,600
domain admins use torrent services is

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,820
when you are running security tools that

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,770
connects to all your workstation and

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,350
servers perhaps to scan for

40
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,439
vulnerabilities these tools usually

41
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,210
require admin rights on all machines

42
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,408
what would be the easiest thing to do

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,229
well let's use the domain admin account

44
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,359
now a better advice and practice is to

45
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,520
use group policies and configure a

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,649
dedicated account to be member of the

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,770
local admin group on all machine and

48
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,139
using that dedicated account for your

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,240
security scanning tool I also see people

50
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:08,639
tending to use the domain admin account

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,750
for almost everything because it's

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,309
easier that way

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,620
you don't need to think about what

54
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,920
permissions to give all finding yourself

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,530
facing error messages

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,179
related to insufficient rights so why

57
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,250
not the use of the mean add an account

58
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,650
for everything now that the main admin

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,390
should only be used when you log into

60
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,330
your domain controllers and

61
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,049
troubleshooting or doing some Active

62
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,730
Directory stuff nothing else now let me

63
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,190
show you the risk of running a domain

64
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,200
admin under a service account if an

65
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,450
attacker gain access for example to a

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,160
Windows machine and the domain admin

67
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,530
account was used to run a Windows

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,329
service then in this demo I will show

69
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,700
you how easy it is to reveal the

70
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,670
password of the domain admin account in

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,488
a clear text this is clear text and not

72
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,899
the hash of the password even believe it

73
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,569
when I say that the first thing

74
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,209
attackers will do is to search for

75
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,000
services running under the domain admin

76
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,450
account and once they find one it's game

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,750
over

78
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,798
so let us dive into the demo and see how

79
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,840
this works from the attacker perspective

80
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm looking into one of my servers and

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,700
let me open the services console you can

82
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,519
see I have a service running under the

83
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,649
domain admin account if I open the

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,320
service properties you can see under the

85
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,450
logon tab the domain admin is used to

86
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,820
run the service indeed which is a bad

87
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,399
thing for your security team and a good

88
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,108
thing for an attacker now the attacker

89
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,299
wants to reveal the password of the

90
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:41,170
domain admin account by hacking into the

91
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:45,220
service by using a tool called se PD or

92
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:48,250
service account password dump or the

93
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,530
attempt failed as you can see let me try

94
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,109
to open a command prompt using the local

95
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,350
system account which I can easily do by

96
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,329
using a famous tool called PS exec

97
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,019
written by the famous mark russinovich

98
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:05,109
the CTO of azure now I have a command

99
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,329
prompt and I'm impersonating the local

100
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,340
system account on this machine which is

101
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,100
the most powerful account on this

102
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,670
machine now if I browse to my tools

103
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:18,548
folder and run the same tool which is sa

104
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,430
PD or service account password dumper

105
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:24,609
tool and provide the service name guess

106
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,169
what I can see now you are right I can

107
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,050
see the password of the domain admin

108
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,750
account in clear-text

109
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,470
the password hash the actual password in

110
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,319
clear-text

111
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,139
as you can see here when you run a

112
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,240
service under a service account windows

113
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,210
stores the password in a secure location

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,849
in the registry so that the service can

115
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,250
still run if the machine is disconnected

116
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,250
from the network mission accomplished

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,080
you can see how easy it is to reveal the

118
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,840
password of service account if you are

119
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,789
the administrator on Windows the

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,469
password of a service account is stored

121
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,360
locally in a secure location in the

122
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,220
registry so that if the machine is

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,970
offline or disconnected from the network

124
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,280
the service can still keep running here

125
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,040
is my challenge for you go to your

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,130
Windows machine and try to locate one of

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,620
your services running under a privileged

128
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,419
service account try to reveal the

129
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,669
password of the service account and

130
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,190
share the result and feedback and the

131
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,560
comments below I know that all this

132
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,719
sounds scary and by now you should

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,450
carefully consider what accounts use to

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,480
run your services as a rule you should

135
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,150
never ever use the domain admin account

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,940
to run any Windows service and there is

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,489
no exception whatsoever for doing this

138
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,690
what about best practices that you

139
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,360
should consider when planning your

140
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,700
service accounts the best way to handle

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,250
service account says to use managed

142
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,789
service accounts they are available to

143
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,860
you since Windows Server 2008 r2 and the

144
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,650
password for such accounts are managed

145
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,720
by your domain controllers there is also

146
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,650
another variation of managed service

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,750
accounts called

148
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,549
group managed service accounts that

149
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,650
allow you to use the same managed

150
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,979
service account across multiple machines

151
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,280
think of an iOS pool account that is

152
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,260
shared across many front-ends nodes the

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,539
next thing you should consider is to

154
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,810
give service accounts just enough

155
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,010
privileges to carry on their purpose

156
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,500
nothing more and nothing less and

157
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,050
remember once an attacker hacks into a

158
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,910
machine every account used on that box

159
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,789
should be considered compromised

160
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,070
including service accounts now during

161
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,590
the demo I used many tools and talked

162
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,419
about a lot of technologies so make sure

163
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,479
to check these links for more

164
