1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:08,290
in this demo we are going to on board a

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:12,219
demo machine to Microsoft Defender ATP

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,709
do that I will go to Security Center dot

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:18,430
windows comm to access the management

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,250
portal then settings and I will scroll

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,220
down to find the onboarding section

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,890
under machine management here you can

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,210
see different ways to deploy Microsoft

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,980
Defender ATP including Group Policy

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,739
System Center Configuration Manager and

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,589
a local script I will quickly choose

12
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:41,559
local script and click download package

13
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:44,108
I will run this script to my machine to

14
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,660
unboard it to Microsoft Defender ATP and

15
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:50,829
as you can see it takes couple of

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,089
seconds now this machine is protected

17
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,859
and managed by Microsoft Defender ATP so

18
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:59,589
as you can see there is no need to

19
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:02,409
install anything just running a script

20
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:06,300
to guide this machine to report to the

21
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:49,080
right Microsoft Defender ATP tenant

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:49,080
[Music]

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,180
