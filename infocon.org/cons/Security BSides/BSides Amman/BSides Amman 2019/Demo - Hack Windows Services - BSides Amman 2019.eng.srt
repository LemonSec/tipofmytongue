1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,430
in this demo I will show you how to stop

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,800
the antivirus service which should not

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,200
be an easy thing to do as these services

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,260
are usually harden in a way that you

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,270
cannot just go and stop them after the

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,610
demo I will share with you links to

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,740
tools and some reference articles so

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,820
that you can try to hack the antivirus

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,880
service yourself

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,710
isn't that great if you watch movies

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,840
where someone is trying to break into a

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,540
secure location the first thing they try

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,790
to do is to kill the alarms or to get

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,589
the security dogs to sleep this is how

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,269
the thief can work freely inside the

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,360
secure location without being detected

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,250
in the computer world things are not

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,170
different as well the first thing you

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,780
want to do as an attacker is to kill the

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,610
alarm which is the antivirus software so

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,980
that you can download more tools from

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,680
the internet and perhaps steal valuable

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,898
information without being detected now

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,149
we all know that the antivirus service

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,290
is hardened in a way that you cannot

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,239
just stop it

27
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,179
even if you are the local admin on the

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,490
machine but believe me when I say there

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,770
are other ways to do that if you don't

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,619
believe me let me show you in this demo

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,069
how to stop the antivirus service in

32
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,659
your Windows machine I am now at my demo

33
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,299
machine and I will quickly open the

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,999
services management console you can see

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,709
a service called dummy service and this

36
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:28,740
can be your antivirus service like

37
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,380
McAfee or Symantec you can also see I

38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,329
cannot start or stop the service as it

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,240
is hardened in a way that prevents any

40
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,850
such interactions which is how we expect

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,130
a good antivirus service to behave let

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,869
me open a command prompt and you can see

43
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,359
I am at the admin on this machine and

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,209
even the local admin cannot stop the

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,329
dummy service now let me use a tool

46
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,659
called PS exec which is written by the

47
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,949
famous mark russinovich the CTO of azure

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,369
currently I'm going to use the - s - I

49
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,849
and - these switches to impersonate the

50
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,160
local system account now I'm running the

51
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,319
command prompt using the local system

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,170
account which is the most powerful

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,470
account in Windows and in theory it can

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,519
do anything now if the local system

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,220
tries to stop

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
my service you can see I get an access

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,290
denied so even the local system cannot

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,000
stop the antivirus service so let me

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,630
quickly clean the comment from screen

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,770
and talk about the security descriptor

61
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,600
definition language or DDL language

62
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,880
using this language I can list the

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,900
permission of any Windows service using

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,900
this command SC which stands for service

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,240
control and then as the show and the

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,980
name of the service don't worry if you

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,780
don't understand what this means at

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,049
first because I'm going to help you

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,780
figure this out this is the STD a

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,960
language and it is so easy to understand

71
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,270
once you know how to read it now D

72
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,840
stands for this section area access

73
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:10,050
control a stands for allow permission

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,480
the next long string is list of rights

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,060
or things you can do to the service and

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,260
then we have the security principle in

77
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,860
this case BU stands for built end users

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,579
sy stands for system account and be a

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,410
stands for the belt and administrator

80
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,930
now to understand this long string that

81
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,240
represents the rights and privileges a

82
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,250
security principal has to a service I

83
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,220
have listed couple of them for

84
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,520
clarification purposes for example the

85
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,790
built an administrator has the RC right

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,370
which stands for read permission so

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,459
built-in admins can read the permission

88
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,280
of the service CR stands for reading

89
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,010
extended rights and L all stands for

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,330
reading objects what is missing though

91
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,880
as the WP right which stands for write

92
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,060
property this is what we need in order

93
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,400
to start and stop services now let us

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,830
search for a Windows service that my

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,830
user can start and stop like the

96
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,840
workstation service for example you can

97
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,359
see I have the permission to start and

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
stop the service so let me quickly copy

99
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,969
the service name and go back and view

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,450
the SDT and permissions of the service

101
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,250
by running the SC as the show and the

102
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,700
service name here you can see what

103
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,460
permissions the built

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,219
admins have which includes the WP

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,049
permission and you can compare that with

106
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,500
the permissions given to the built-in

107
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,110
admins on our dummy service now I will

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,020
quickly copy the sedl permissions of

109
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,200
that dummy service to a notepad so we

110
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,479
can have a closer look what I will do

111
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,310
next is to copy the rights assigned to

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,220
the built-in admins on the workstation

113
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,290
service and replace it to the rights

114
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,630
assigned to the built-in admin on the

115
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:07,240
dummy service this should do the trick

116
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:10,030
after all now I use the SC as the set

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,730
and the dummy service name to construct

118
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,190
my new command and then I will paste it

119
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,710
to an elevated command prompt running

120
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,230
under the local service account you can

121
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,200
see his default command and it shows it

122
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,740
is running successfully the belt and

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,469
admins now have the same rights under my

124
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,110
service that they have on the

125
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,140
workstation service including the WP

126
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,940
right now if we go to the services

127
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,789
management console and search for our

128
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,310
dummy service you can see I can stop the

129
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,310
service now mission accomplished

130
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,520
throughout the demo I used many tools

131
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,590
and talked about a lot of technologies

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,960
so make sure to check these links for

133
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,510
more information do you believe me now

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,270
any Windows service can be stopped if

135
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,550
you have the admin privileges so here is

136
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,320
my challenge for you go to your Windows

137
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,570
machine and try to locate your antivirus

138
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,790
service in the services console and

139
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,159
verify that it cannot be stopped from

140
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,970
that console you might have McAfee

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,800
Symantec or any other product now using

142
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,250
the same techniques I showed you in the

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,960
demo try to stop the service finally

144
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,400
please share your results of this

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
