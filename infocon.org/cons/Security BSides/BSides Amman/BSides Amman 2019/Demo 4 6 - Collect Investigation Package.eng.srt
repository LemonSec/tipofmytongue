1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,350
when you're forensic team is involved to

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,690
understand how the attack happened and

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,879
truly understand the depth of the attack

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,099
the first thing they want to do is to

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:16,100
collect as much information from the

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,690
infected machine Microsoft Defender ATP

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,030
gives you the ability from the

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,100
management portal to go and collect an

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,460
investigation package that your forensic

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,680
team can use so here I am logged to the

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,900
Microsoft Defender ATP management portal

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,360
and I can see I have couple of alerts

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,150
and they have some machines at risks

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,700
let me quickly choose demo 3 machine and

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,460
open the machine page I can quickly see

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,950
the risk level of that machine obviously

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,820
there is one incident with seven active

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,440
alerts so it might worth investigating

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,350
you can see a list of actions in the top

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,599
bar as this action you as security

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,670
professional can perform remotely from

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,090
the management portal without going to

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,880
the machine itself one of the actions is

24
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,579
collect investigation package if I click

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,740
it this will send a request to the local

26
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:09,408
Microsoft Defender ATP agent on that

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,869
machine instructing it to collect

28
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,120
forensic information right now from that

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,159
machine and send the results back to the

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,500
Microsoft defend their ATP cloud

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,630
services and then make it available to

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,310
me as a security professional from the

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,429
portal so that I can continue my

34
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,740
investigation I already did that so in

35
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,530
the Action Center I can see there is an

36
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,929
item waiting for my review I can see the

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,270
investigation package is now ready for

38
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,549
me to review I will open it quickly and

39
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,560
see what's inside here you can see a lot

40
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,570
of information made available for you to

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,090
help you in your investigation let me

42
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,949
start by the autoruns as most attacks

43
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,680
involve modifying the auto run on

44
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,240
machines to persist after reboots so

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,920
it's a good thing to review the author

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,140
and configuration for the infected

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,210
machine you also get a list of installed

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,920
programs on that machine the list

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,500
contains information about each

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,570
application installed on the machine the

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,570
date of installation and other more

52
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,490
detailed information for you to review

53
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,130
next we have the network connections

54
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,200
very important piece of information if

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,359
the attack is still happening on that

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,899
machine you want to learn about what

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,269
this measure

58
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,159
is communicating with so here you have

59
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,769
the active network connections of that

60
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,200
machine including ports and IPs

61
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,260
this machine is communicating with right

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,560
now you can also get both DNS cache and

63
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,569
ARP cache just in case DNS poisoning or

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,700
ARP poisoning is taking place in this

65
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,048
attack and to help you understand how

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,959
the machine is performing name

67
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,750
resolution you also get the firewall

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,390
execution log and the IP configuration

69
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,790
of the machine which might become handy

70
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,319
for your forensic team the investigation

71
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,690
package also includes a list of

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,030
processes running on that machine which

73
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,549
gives you deep inside about what is

74
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,239
happening inside that box without even

75
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:02,120
touching that machine you also get the

76
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,280
scheduled tasks information to learn if

77
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,109
an attacker creates a scheduled task on

78
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,840
that machine perhaps to persist after

79
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:10,519
reboots as you can see in the excel

80
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,650
sheet here you get a lot of information

81
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,109
about each scheduled task on that

82
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,510
machine now my favorite one is the

83
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,030
security Event log here you can search

84
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,769
inside the security log files of the

85
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,230
infected machine and analyze all

86
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:27,019
security events to help you understand

87
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,090
more about the attack happening next you

88
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,129
get a comprehensive information about

89
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,220
services running on the remote machine

90
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,798
including service name running state

91
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,440
service account used to run each service

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,389
and the associated process ID for

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,150
running services you get also

94
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,280
information about SMP sessions taking

95
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,229
place on that machine because remember

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,209
attackers might move from machine to

97
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:52,940
another by using pass the hash technique

98
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,370
and they can use SMP for lateral

99
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,970
movement so here you get a list of all

100
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,069
SMP sessions system information is

101
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,019
another good information you get as part

102
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,548
of the investigation package to learn

103
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,159
more about the machine and the hardware

104
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,919
profile finally you get information

105
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,379
about all local groups on that machine

106
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,690
as you can see here you also get

107
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:18,108
information about session information so

108
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,969
you can see that a user code master is

109
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,729
connecting to this remote machine using

110
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,279
RDP protocol you get a forensic

111
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,740
investigation summary file containing

112
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,280
information about how Microsoft Defender

113
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,900
ATP

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,080
we collected all this information

115
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,989
together for example Microsoft Defender

116
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,240
a tipi agent on that machine ran this

117
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,690
command to collect the process list and

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,790
generate a CSV file this can help you as

119
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,040
a security professional to learn which

120
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,800
commands you can use to collect forensic

121
00:04:46,040 --> 00:05:37,630
information which I believe is so handy

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:39,690
[Music]

123
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,690
you
