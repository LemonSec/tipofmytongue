1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,490
the next wave of applying machine

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,010
learning and AI in your security

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,219
defensive strategy is by trying to

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,379
detect attacks after they happen that is

5
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:17,320
if your endpoint detection technique

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:19,150
fails to stop an attack how can you know

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,820
there is an attack happening inside your

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,799
network this is where another form of

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,130
machine learning is applied that relies

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,829
on anomaly detection or unsupervised

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,049
learning and this is simply the Machine

12
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:35,440
layers what's normal and when something

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,140
is outside of that norm occurs it does

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,000
not label it good or bad but still it's

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,730
a great compliment to pull into a

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,920
supervised approach to find something

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,529
that perhaps a normal researcher

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,350
wouldn't find or an anti-virus for that

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,809
fails to detect and normally detection

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,210
usually happens after the attack

21
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:57,879
compromises a machine and start moving

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,510
inside your network perhaps to find more

23
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,879
valuable assets now Microsoft answer to

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,360
this area is by implementing the agile

25
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,970
advanced threat protection or agile ATP

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,360
which was formerly known as advanced

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,640
threat analytics or ata let me try to

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,070
help you visualize how anomaly detection

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,490
can help you detect an attack after it

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,309
happens suppose we have shown a new hire

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,500
who is a security expert and his job is

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,560
to monitor your environment for attacks

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,390
the first thing Joan would do is to

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,520
learn about your environment his

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,860
thoughts by learning about all the

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,080
machines in the network what operating

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,050
systems they are running for example and

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,750
he would also learn about all users and

39
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,270
groups in your network especially who is

40
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,870
member of highly privileged groups like

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,119
the domain admin and schema admin groups

42
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,730
now that Joan knows about every machine

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,190
every user and every group in the

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,460
environment John will start learning

45
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,770
about the behavior of users for each

46
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,039
user in the environment John would

47
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:09,098
creates a behavioral profile in this

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,439
behavioral profile John will analyze

49
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:14,409
which machines each user is normally

50
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,940
using what are the login hours for each

51
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:19,630
user which

52
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,900
users are sensitive for each user John

53
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,840
with also men who are his peers and who

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,500
that user works with and finally what

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,090
resources each user at normally access

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,040
now let us replace John with Azure

57
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,410
advanced threat protection which is an

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,350
agent that you install on each and every

59
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,299
domain controller in your environment

60
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,150
suppose we have Alice who works in the

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:46,390
HR department and remember that as your

62
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,820
ATP knows everything about Alice already

63
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,309
her working hours the machine or

64
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,910
machines she normally used and what

65
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,390
resources she usually access now if as

66
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:02,620
your ATP detects that Alice is logging

67
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,959
from the CF o machine as your ATP will

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,390
immediately detect an anomaly and raise

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,880
an ellipse to the security team because

70
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,579
that might mean that an attacker

71
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,310
compromises her machine and credential

72
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,730
and using some techniques like parsley

73
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:24,100
hash to move to the CFO machine which

74
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:26,649
Alice normally want to do the same thing

75
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,709
will happen if Azure detects that Alice

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,070
is trying to access the finance file

77
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,770
share which is an anomaly as either ATP

78
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,989
knows through its learning phase that

79
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,620
Alice normally does not access the

80
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,600
finance share another ATP is a great

81
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,790
tool to have in your environment that in

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,970
complements other security measures and

83
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,760
controls that you already have has your

84
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,620
ATV agents start by collecting clocks

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,340
from your domain controllers and other

86
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,459
resources then the analyse and learn

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,670
phase kick off and this is when other

88
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,670
ATP agents learn about the environment

89
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,429
the third phase is when detection

90
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,369
happened due to an anomaly in which case

91
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,130
you will get alerted and provided with a

92
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,970
comprehensive dashboard to track what is

93
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:22,570
happening the final stage is integration

94
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:26,229
this is where our ATP integrates with

95
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,990
Microsoft Defender ATP so that we can

96
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,930
have identity based protection with

97
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:36,610
as your ATP and machine or end point

98
00:04:31,930 --> 00:05:23,440
based protection with Microsoft ATP

99
00:04:36,610 --> 00:05:25,500
