to cover a very important aspect related

28
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,760
to windows forensics

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
the conference has covered a lot of

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
talks about

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,000
application security and i think

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
everyone is eager to know more about now

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
forensics because it has its own

34
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
audience and special

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
um sign group um i can't talk enough

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
about dr ali of course

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
um you all know him and

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
joining us in this session is of great

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
demonstration to his knowledge and

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
background in the area

41
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
and uh we don't want to talk a lot about

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
this of course

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,480
the session will be live streamed if you

and on facebook um one one comment

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
regarding the forensics image

47
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,000
i know everyone is asking about it and

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
we have faced a lot of

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
issues related to download limitations

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
maybe not only because it's a limitation

51
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,080
on the of the request

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
but also because there is a huge demand

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
on the downloads so we will handle this

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
um either during the session or after

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,159

leave some time at the end so we can go

86
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
over your questions

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
and try to answer them just a quick

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
introduction about myself

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,759
my name is ali hadi i work as a

90
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,840
professor at champlain college

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
i also work as a research team lead at

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
the lee center

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
for digital forensics and cyber security

94
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,160
and i'm also the the co-founder

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
for my screen now you can see my screen

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
i assume

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
and i'm also the co-founder of cyber5w

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,360
so today we'll try to go over

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
a case a windows forensic case

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
the idea is to try to learn a little bit

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,919
about

102
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
windows forensics by what we call

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
learning by doing so the idea is

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
to learn a little bit about windows

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,759
forensics this is definitely not

106
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
going to cover everything related to

107
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,120
windows forensics

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
at the end we usually cover that in a

109
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
course or a semester

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
or whatever uh so try to go over the

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,440
most

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
i would say important details related to

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
the case

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,759
uh how we will work the case different

115
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,319
tools

116
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,199
most of the tools uh actually are or

117
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,880
even more all of them probably just

118
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,800
one uh are tools by alex zimmerman big

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,919
shout out to

120
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,280
eric and all the good uh work he does

121
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
i i also highly recommend you go and

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
support him

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
uh so again the idea is to cover a case

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,199
learn by doing

125
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
if you didn't get the chance to download

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,479
the files

127
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,080
unfortunately i we tried our best to

128
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
handle that but it seems there's a lot

129
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,400
of demand on the

130
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
on the image so we'll get that figured

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
out after the session

132
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
uh so after that you have the video

133
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
which is going to be recorded

134
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
and you'll have the file so you can go

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
over that so enough about that

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
let's get started if you already

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
downloaded the uh

138
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
if you already downloaded the vm the vm

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
already includes the

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
the tools the image and a document which

141
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,039
has

142
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
an explanation about what we are going

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
to be covering today

144
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,080
so we can uh i can i can open that and

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
talk a little bit about this before i do

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
that

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
if you got the vm then again the tools

148
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,319
are within this uh

149
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
volume which is the v hdx volume

150
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
so you can just double click on it it

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
will automatically be mounted

152
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
i know you might not have the arsenal

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,479
image

154
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,400
mounter in there and that's because

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,960
this is a i would say i updated this

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
early today morning after

157
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,720
eric recommended we use image mount over

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
ftk imager but you can still use ftk

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
imager it's the same thing uh to use

160
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
so we can start by again just double

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
click on the image edit

162
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
the the volume it will automatically be

163
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
mounted so you don't need to really do

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
anything there

165
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,520
extract the image mount the urls

166
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
to the arsenal image monitor will be

167
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
provided or you can just

168
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
google them it's not hard to find

169
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
and then i would want to open this in a

170
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
new window so we can have

171
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,360
these two separately

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
for interruption but some people say

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,400
that

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
the resolution is not very clear

175
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
so if that can be enhanced

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
can i i actually even use a smaller

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,760
uh monitor for this problem but

178
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,838
let's see if this will help yeah

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,560
will this be better

180
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,800
here hear from the audience is it better

181
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,959
no

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
i mean actually for me it's clear i

183
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
don't know and it

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
says it's fine from my side

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,279
all right i think we can go on

186
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,320
okay great thank you yeah

187
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
so let's we got the

188
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,440
okay so again uh welcome to the

189
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
workshop uh this is if you want to by

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
the way

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
how to access the the tools i just wrote

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
that

193
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
if you want to update eric's tools all

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you need to do is just

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
in the directory where eric has his

196
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
tools just

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
uh ctrl shift and then open powershell

198
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,760
here

199
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
and then all you need to do is do the

200
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
get and this will update the tools i'm

201
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
not gonna do that for now but you can do

202
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,720
that

203
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
if you want to get an updated version of

204
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,839
the tools

205
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
again thanks to eric for doing all of

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
that for us

207
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
now the case we have here in hand this

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
is a little uh overview

209
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,480
that let me scroll so

210
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,959
we've been given a system uh the system

211
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
has been used for some illegal activity

212
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
uh the user has access some confidential

213
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
uh documents which the user was not

214
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
supposed to be

215
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
accessing or was not supposed to use

216
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,920
the system has two user accounts i would

217
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,720
say

218
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
that's the

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
that's the reason uh this case was

220
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320
created

221
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
for in this way just so that

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
i would say to confuse a little bit the

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
analyst and then to also

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
see how they will approach it because

225
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
you don't want to follow a rabbit hole

226
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
and then you might waste your time

227
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
at the end uh your client the that you

228
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
will be doing the investigation for

229
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
is only going to be paying you for a

230
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
certain amount of

231
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,360
hours so it's better to know how to

232
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
approach this

233
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
so we have two two users okay we'll see

234
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,480
how we will

235
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
be able to filter that and focus on one

236
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
user and see which user exactly was the

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
user

238
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
that we are interested in or the most

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
important user

240
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
for this case so the system has two

241
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
users one is called joker and the other

242
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,720
one is the ie user

243
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
which is the default one that comes with

244
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
these microsoft vms

245
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
and you are required to provide answers

246
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
to all of the questions below

247
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
now one of the uh notes i usually tell

248
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
my students is

249
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
screenshot or it didn't happen sometimes

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
i'll just get

251
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
like an answer especially if we are

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
learning probably in a report

253
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
you might not want to add screenshots

254
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,880
all the time but

255
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,600
if we are if we want to learn if this is

256
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
about learning

257
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
and stuff like that then it's good to

258
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
have a screenshot and also to provide

259
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,920
your

260
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
instructor with proof that you truly did

261
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
this work so

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
that's why i say screenshot or it didn't

263
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,680
happen so we'll need to take

264
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
a screenshot for uh what we did now

265
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
first question is what is the hash value

266
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,959
for the given forensic image

267
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
so let's start by actually mounting our

268
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,240
image so we go to arsenal

269
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,519
image monitor this one

270
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:25,839
once you double click on it

271
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
okay so this is a as you can see it's no

272
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
license it's a free mode

273
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
i highly recommend if you do forensics

274
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,959
you get a

275
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,320
full version so that's okay

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,639
it needs a driver let the driver be set

277
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
up

278
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
well good now we want to mount the disk

279
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,680
image

280
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,240
so the disk image is already in this

281
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
location

282
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
just select that and i want to

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,839
because we want to sometimes access some

284
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
certain directories which have

285
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
maybe some permissions that we won't be

286
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
able to access

287
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
so it's good to use the right temporary

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,360
disk space

289
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
what this really does is it's not really

290
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
gonna write

291
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,079
uh inside the evidence itself so it's

292
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,880
not gonna

293
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
really modify anything in your evidence

294
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
so don't worry about that

295
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
the evidence will not be tampered it's

296
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
going to create

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
let's say cash and all the modifications

298
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,200
whether you need to let's say bypass

299
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,160
some certain privileges etc those will

300
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,480
be

301
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
changed within that cache so it will be

302
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,839
stored in that cache

303
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,079
so it's all it's only temporary in that

304
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,760
cache and it's got not going to be

305
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
reflected

306
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,279
on your uh on your image so i will

307
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
just specify this specify alternate

308
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,639
difference the file location because i i

309
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,839
usually save them

310
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,839
on my desktop and delete the

311
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
de-referencing file

312
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
after unmounting i just like to do that

313
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
in case i load the image again i don't

314
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
want to get that error message saying

315
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
this was already mounted before so you

316
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
can do that

317
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
then okay

318
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
so again i'm going to store the diff

319
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
file see it's a diff file on my desktop

320
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
now we have the image mounted uh

321
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
you can see it has been mounted to the

322
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,920
the f drive letter we can see it's a

323
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,120
an image we can see the the users we

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
we mentioned in the case ie user and

325
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
the uh the joker user see this is one

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
we can say continue now because we are

327
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,959
going to modify

328
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,639
the permissions but it's going to modify

329
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
that define

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,639
so we can see these are the users that

331
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,079
we have over here

332
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
so we can we can do that

333
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,040
and if we

334
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,959
expand here we should be able to see

335
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,319
uh okay so this is not gonna calculate

336
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,320
the what is it

337
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
so if this is not going to calculate the

338
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
let's let's do

339
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
this and i'm going to do it a different

340
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
different way

341
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
so let's do this quickly and i'm going

342
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,120
to leave it to run because it's going to

343
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
take some time

344
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,079
so if we select the b sides and then

345
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
this and i'll say verify drive image

346
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
so let this run so we can get the we can

347
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
get the hash value so we leave some

348
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,639
space for that later

349
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
okay which user account was is used

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
to access some confidential documents we

351
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
still don't know the answer to that yet

352
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
so even if it's listed as question

353
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,320
number two

354
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
don't get confused that you need to

355
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
solve those

356
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,759
questions in the exact order no you can

357
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,160
you can go back and forth

358
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,360
uh because at the end probably your

359
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
client might give you these questions or

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
might give you the uh what they want

361
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,680
uh out of their of their investigation

362
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
of what you will be doing for them not

363
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
in a really

364
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
let's say uh chronological order or

365
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,240
like in an order that you expect to go

366
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
and investigate them but

367
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
you can uh like again jump back

368
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
between them once you have a clear

369
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
answer you can just go back

370
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,720
and add that answer in there so we need

371
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
also to explain

372
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
proof and i i by the way did this on

373
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
purpose so i i could have

374
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
let's say put them in a chronological

375
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,600
order

376
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
but it's also to explain the idea here

377
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
uh

378
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,720
if unless by the way you you do the

379
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
questionnaire with your client and then

380
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,560
you gather those questions that you need

381
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
to answer then probably after you get

382
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,360
those

383
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
you will list them in the way you will

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,920
you will do the investigation but if

385
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,440
these were just given to you

386
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
which in in our case it is uh don't

387
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,520
worry about that we

388
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
can just again go back and forth between

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,959
them

390
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
so explaining details we don't have any

391
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
details yet so we need to

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,439
start working on this did the user

393
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,039
access any confidential again

394
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,559
this is still not clear to us what prove

395
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
we still have no idea so as you can see

396
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
we have no idea of

397
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
first which user access these files we

398
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,400
don't have any proof yet

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,280
to let's say give answers or put those

400
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
answers out there

401
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
so what we will do is first thing we

402
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,320
need to know

403
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
what type of data are we interested in

404
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
so here it's clear

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,559
we are talking about user access for

406
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,039
some documents so we are interested

407
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
in accessing interested in

408
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
artifacts related to user activity

409
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
that's number one

410
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
and those user activity is related to if

411
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,440
we

412
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
let's say narrow our focus down again

413
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
more

414
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,039
it's about accessing documents so it's

415
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
clear that we want to prove that the

416
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,840
user

417
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
has opened a certain document which is

418
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
still not clear to us which documents

419
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,440
have been opened so we need to focus on

420
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
the artifacts that will give the answers

421
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,919
about uh about documents let's say

422
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
so one of the uh we have i would say

423
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
two yes for interruptions but we have

424
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
tons of questions and about any of the

425
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,960
environments yet

426
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
people are asking about the image the vm

427
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,679
password number one

428
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
uh number two they are asking a lot

429
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
about the difference between

430
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
any the links between the different

431
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
links here when you said that you added

432
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,039
the

433
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,880
zimmerman tools what's the difference

434
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
between the two folders that has been

435
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,600
shared

436
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
um they're worried that this is

437
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
intentional or some additional clues in

438
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
the

439
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
new image also in the new files

440
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
that's a trick also um

441
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,960
again just to clarify the tools i think

442
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
people are

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,440
not all of them very much

444
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,679
[Music]

445
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
some of them are new this is their first

446
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,000
the forensics uh

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
session so i think if we can just give

448
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,320
us a little bit of

449
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,559
a sample introduction for everything the

450
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
tools that we are using

451
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
some just small words on all of this

452
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
stuff

453
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
i think it will get everyone uh

454
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
well will will into us here anyone with

455
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
us they're

456
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,840
asking about them the mount tool name

457
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,720
also

458
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,320
okay so the tool which i used to mount

459
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,160
uh the tool i used to mount the image is

460
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,840
uh arsenal image mounted

461
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
and we can get that from let me open my

462
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,000
browser

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,919
here and we can get that from

464
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,200
arsenal image

465
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,080
hunter from

466
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,158
here and if you go to

467
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,600
you go to

468
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
sync downloads

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,679
you should find

470
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
yeah this is the one this is the one i'm

471
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,559
using it's the exact same version i i

472
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,280
just downloaded it actually

473
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,559
earlier today so this is the same one

474
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
i will actually add the links to all of

475
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,840
the tools

476
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
uh even alex tools even though by the

477
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,280
way

478
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
if you just type eric zimmerman and

479
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
google

480
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
it will show up eric's very known for

481
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,480
his tools and i

482
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
i doubt there is a investigators out

483
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,880
there that don't use them

484
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,039
so if you just type eric zimmerman tools

485
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
you'll get that but

486
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,679
i will add those to this document

487
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,720
and upload that again that's one the

488
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,919
files that were

489
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,000
shared on mega

490
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,840
those only include the e01 which is the

491
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,120
this image this case image and

492
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
this document here it does not include

493
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,760
the tools the

494
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
vhtx tools just the image but i can

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
upload that again after we finish the

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
session

497
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
and this vmware by the way i also

498
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,200
downloaded it from microsoft

499
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,760
so it's really not a special virtual

500
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,799
machine

501
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,760
there's nothing special about it you can

502
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
just call windows

503
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
10 vm download

504
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,600
and then you can get them from here

505
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,799
just select the hypervisor you use so

506
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,400
select the windows 10

507
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
and then select whatever hypervisor you

508
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
use i'm using vmware so that's what i

509
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,280
did

510
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,159
and i downloaded that i got these links

511
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
by the way to all of that

512
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
there's nothing really different between

513
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
what i'm covering now and what was

514
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
shared

515
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
again the only difference is currently i

516
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,919
only shared

517
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,520
the e01 because it's fast and the

518
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
this text file because the

519
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
the whole vm with everything inside it i

520
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
think it's 20 plus gigabytes

521
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,880
so i i thought that if you

522
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
you won't have you won't have time to

523
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,080
download

524
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,640
all of that within the time from when i

525
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,440
woke up

526
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,120
got these uploaded uh again

527
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
until our session but i i will upload

528
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
them again so don't worry about that

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
and the password by the way this is the

530
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
the default password

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
that microsoft use this is not the

532
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,360
password that i use

533
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
it's also by the way you can find it

534
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
here so

535
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
again because i'm not using anything

536
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,640
special here so you can find it over

537
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,600
here

538
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
uh everything else really is

539
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,679
the basic vm with those tools i'll i'll

540
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
put a list

541
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,960
later for everyone with uh details from

542
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
with urls and details from where

543
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,799
can uh where where they can get them

544
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,559
does that answer all these questions or

545
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
is there anything else

546
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,120
no that's that's it

547
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,960
there's a question about life forensics

548
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
tool but maybe we'll cover that

549
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,840
later on

550
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,520
okay yeah i'll uh we can we can add

551
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,240
i'll try to finish as fast as possible

552
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
not as fast that you don't learn

553
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,320
anything

554
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,880
but i mean uh give some time for

555
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,600
questions

556
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,159
and uh you can feel free to reach out to

557
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
me after the session also

558
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
probably will add more to this later

559
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
uh but yeah i'll try also by the way the

560
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
tools each tool i'll use i'll try to

561
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
explain what that

562
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
is give it at least an overview the idea

563
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,000
was to

564
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,559
explain the tool while we use it so

565
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,679
arsenal image

566
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,120
mounted from the name it's just to mount

567
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,159
that e01 which is the forensic image

568
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,720
which has a copy of the disk we are

569
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
investigating

570
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,559
so what this tool will do is it's gonna

571
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,840
mount

572
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,799
the image and have it appear on your

573
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,760
computer

574
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,480
as if it's another volume on your

575
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,200
computer

576
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
so if you go by the way to this pc

577
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,039
you'll see that

578
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
we have another drive or another volume

579
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
uh connected to your to your system it's

580
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
actually another

581
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,679
the it's actually the the uh the image

582
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,279
which we are investigating

583
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,440
so that's what uh arsenal image monitor

584
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,080
does

585
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
ftk imager is another tool which does

586
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,200
the same thing

587
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
and it also can be used it's actually

588
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
mostly used for

589
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,279
acquisition plus mounting we can use

590
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:03,679
that

591
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,919
but again there are some

592
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
i would say lack of support for some

593
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,440
features

594
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,279
so we recommend uh based on also

595
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,159
uh eric's recommendations and others to

596
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,960
use

597
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
arsenal image monitor as you can see

598
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,720
here by the way these are the hash

599
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,400
values computed of the

600
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
image now this is the

601
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
hash value of your image as you can see

602
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,600
here

603
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,120
the computed hash with what is stored

604
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
they are com they match so that means

605
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,799
the

606
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
the image has not been tempered we don't

607
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
have any same thing

608
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,679
so whether it's md5 or sha-1

609
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,600
you can see they were both be they were

610
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,039
both calculated

611
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,919
and they are both they both match so

612
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,840
that means the evidence has not been

613
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
tampered which is what we want

614
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,240
there's no bad sectors or no bad blocks

615
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
in this image so that's why

616
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,960
you see nothing over here you can copy

617
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
this to your

618
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,720
uh answer so you can say maybe md5

619
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
and this is the answer for md5 or sha

620
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,240
one

621
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
and put the answer for what you got for

622
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
uh sha one uh now one thing i do like to

623
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,360
explain here about

624
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,640
the e01 probably it's better to

625
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,600
explain it a little bit using paint i'm

626
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,799
not good at drawing

627
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,440
so please excuse me if you see my dong

628
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
is not the best

629
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,080
but think of the image like this this is

630
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
the image

631
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,760
okay this is the e01 and inside your e01

632
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,120
we have

633
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
two things right this is just trying to

634
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,799
explain the idea behind

635
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,760
the concept behind this okay so this is

636
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,559
the image

637
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,520
the e01 the whole file and within the

638
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,840
file we have

639
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
the drive which we are imaging which is

640
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,080
image sorry

641
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
that we are investigating which is now

642
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,279
uh

643
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,320
this one the f drive okay so this is the

644
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,200
drive

645
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
this one is inside here so if i just add

646
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,200
some details here

647
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
let's say this is the f drive maybe i

648
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,159
increase the font a little bit

649
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
okay and so this is the f drive here

650
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,200
and when ftk was telling you that this

651
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
is the computed hash

652
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,840
and this is the stored verification hash

653
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,960
what does that mean it means this hash

654
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,559
value uh

655
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
was actually stored in a metadata

656
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,919
section

657
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
so this section over here by the way i'm

658
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,159
gonna try

659
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,440
uh do it this way

660
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,840
so this is made this is the metadata

661
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,799
over here

662
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,440
which is the metadata about this

663
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
forensic image

664
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
and what this metadata includes

665
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,720
actually is or one of them one of the

666
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
things that it includes is these hash

667
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,840
values

668
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,799
these hash values are actually stored

669
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
within this metadata section

670
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
so what happens is when you use ftk

671
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,399
imager or

672
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
any other tool okay what happens

673
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,120
is it will go and hash the volume again

674
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
okay it will hash the volume again and

675
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
then it will compare it with the hash

676
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,399
value

677
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,279
within this metadata section okay and if

678
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,760
they match it will tell you they match

679
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,080
this is totally by the way different

680
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
than you

681
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,640
going and saying i'm gonna hash

682
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
the whole file and let's just change

683
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
that over here with

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
with this green color over here so if

685
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,360
you

686
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,600
hash let's say you take the whole file

687
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,240
the e01 file and you hash it like this

688
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
you will get something completely

689
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,279
different but

690
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,480
if you like open it within a tool which

691
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,520
understands

692
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,559
e01 and it can compute

693
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,559
the hash value for you compare it with

694
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,799
it which with what is stored in here

695
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
and that's actually what we need if they

696
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,159
match then

697
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
our data has not been tampered this is

698
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
very important because i see all of the

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
all the time

700
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,000
even i would say uh our

701
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
freshmen when they start they will when

702
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,520
i tell them

703
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
give me the hash value some of them

704
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,640
might just go and

705
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
hash the whole e01 uh image

706
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,000
so that's one we uh we've got that done

707
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
let's go move on to the other parts so

708
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,399
the other parts again we said we don't

709
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,399
know who accessed those files yet

710
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,799
we have two users so we are confused

711
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
which one of those access the files

712
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,600
but we are talking about documents so

713
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,320
there are

714
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,279
certain artifacts which the which i

715
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,480
would say

716
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,760
track documents now microsoft when they

717
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,799
created these uh

718
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,880
these tracking features they didn't

719
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
really create them for investigators to

720
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,760
come

721
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,000
and use them for investigations they

722
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
created them for user experience

723
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
so they created them so the user can

724
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,120
later on

725
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
uh if they are if they frequently open a

726
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
file or if they just recently opened an

727
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
application and they want to open it

728
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,360
again

729
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
or if they open the file and they want

730
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
to open it again

731
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,320
they can easily go back and find that

732
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,159
file or find that application and open

733
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:22,799
it again

734
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,600
so these are features microsoft did not

735
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,240
add them

736
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,320
for investigators but we are taking

737
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
advantage of them

738
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
so one of them is if you like right

739
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,159
click over here

740
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
which is called jump list so we can see

741
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
jump lists

742
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,640
actually are these

743
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
type of lists which show you what are

744
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,000
the files that have been

745
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,799
uh recently opened or frequently opened

746
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,799
or sometimes you can even pin them if

747
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,120
this

748
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,159
is a user might pin this document

749
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,520
especially if this document is what they

750
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,679
normally use um every time they use

751
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,000
their system so they might even pin them

752
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,080
these are all details that we can use to

753
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,519
our advantage

754
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,120
and what this means is if a user

755
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,080
opened let's say a document then

756
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
probably we can find it in that

757
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,159
in that jump list okay so we can

758
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,120
parse that that's one two another user

759
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
artifact related to jump

760
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,159
to documents and uh those

761
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,600
this type of thing is when you open a

762
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,039
document

763
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,399
again for user experience microsoft will

764
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
create a shortcut which is what they

765
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,880
call

766
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,640
an lnk file so if we if we

767
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,519
let's say parse the details of the lnk

768
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,679
files and the jump list we might find an

769
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,880
idea of

770
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
those artifacts which have been uh

771
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
have been open or those documents which

772
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
have been

773
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,039
opened by by that user now since we have

774
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,640
two users here

775
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
uh i'm gonna use a little bit different

776
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
because i want to copy

777
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,600
i would say or i want to make sure my

778
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,720
tool can

779
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
pull both of these tools okay there are

780
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,760
many ways to do these things i'm going

781
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
to do it just one way

782
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,000
it's probably an easy way maybe someone

783
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,840
has a better way of doing this

784
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,880
so i'm gonna pull the two artifacts

785
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,799
related to let's say the jump list and

786
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
the lnk files

787
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
of both users and then focus on them

788
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,519
using different tools

789
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,840
which have been created by alex

790
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,640
zimmerman

791
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
so let's put these

792
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,240
minimize them and if we go to

793
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,960
our tools our examiners tools and then

794
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,640
i already have my powershell open

795
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,240
i'm gonna use them as administrator

796
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,240
and let me do this i

797
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
will okay

798
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,120
so uh first thing is let's pass let's

799
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
say

800
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,120
uh not sure if this one can be minimized

801
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,519
let's just leave it how it is so first

802
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,399
thing is let's

803
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,679
parse let's say the lnk files so there's

804
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,039
a tool called

805
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,960
le cmt okay

806
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,320
now if you by the way just type le cmd

807
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,360
and just hit enter this is also one of

808
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,720
the great things about

809
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,159
eric's tools is first they have a lot of

810
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
documentation showing you how to use the

811
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,240
tool so really it's very easy just

812
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,720
type the tool name like that you'll see

813
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
the help uh on how to use it that's one

814
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,159
two

815
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,080
learning how to use one tool and all

816
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,519
those options by the way

817
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,279
they are the same use across all of

818
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,279
these tools so it's really

819
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,720
uh very easy to memorize even if

820
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
i can say it that way because you don't

821
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
have to keep

822
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,840
trying to memorize different options for

823
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,039
different tools and

824
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,000
this which gives me this uh feature this

825
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,279
one gives me that

826
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,159
no they are all using the same thing so

827
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:06,799
once you

828
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,719
i would say once you use one and you

829
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
know how to use it

830
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,320
you can use that for all of the other

831
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,199
tools

832
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,320
so one first thing is uh we can use the

833
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,399
uh le cmd to grab those uh

834
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,918
le cmd files lnk files excuse me

835
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,119
that's one uh two if you want to parse a

836
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,239
directory so

837
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,599
let's say we want to pass the whole

838
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,599
directory of links you can use

839
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,719
the the d option or the d switch

840
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,719
if you want to pass just a single file

841
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,079
you can just use the

842
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,199
f switch and then if you want to

843
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,679
let's say convert them to a csv your

844
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
output into a csv

845
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,960
you can use the csv that's what i'm

846
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,320
going to do

847
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,879
and again these are all the uh

848
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
let's say the different examples that

849
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
you can use so it's really

850
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
straightforward you don't really need

851
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,200
any kind of

852
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,160
i would say explanation for that except

853
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
you need to know where

854
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,200
the uh the artifacts is located

855
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,119
so let's go there i'm gonna close this

856
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,320
for now

857
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,280
so if we go to users let me go to view

858
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,640
options and make sure

859
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,760
i'm not sure if on your vm i might have

860
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,520
forgotten to do this

861
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,119
so make sure you uh show everything so

862
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,160
go to head

863
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,800
go to view maybe i do this again go to

864
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,599
view

865
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
uh options and then go to view

866
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,960
again and then show hidden files folders

867
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,000
directories

868
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
or drives uh hide empty drives i'm gonna

869
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,760
list everything

870
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,400
unhide all of them and hide protected

871
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
operating system

872
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,240
the files i'm also going to uncheck this

873
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,000
so that way

874
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,680
we can find we can list everything so

875
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,720
everything is now hidden let's say if we

876
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,040
go

877
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,599
for example to you i user we just take

878
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,880
that one first

879
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,760
and then we are interested in let's say

880
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,640
lnk

881
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
so lnk is located in application data

882
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,280
roaming microsoft and then windows

883
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,800
and then recent items or actually

884
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,119
it is recent if we go there you

885
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,320
will find those uh lnk files but why are

886
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,680
we seeing them empty here is because

887
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,800
this is this directory

888
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,720
has a specific geo id and let's say

889
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,680
it has a spec specific feature which is

890
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
to show or to

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,040
store these recent items so the

892
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,520
the explorer shell will not allow you to

893
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
see what's inside them

894
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,240
because the explorer shell understands

895
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,119
them differently

896
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,119
than what we are trying to look at them

897
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,800
in a different way so what we can do

898
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
here is do

899
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
recent okay and if we do that let me

900
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
just clear this again

901
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,839
probably and run the command again so if

902
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,800
we do this

903
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,359
you can see that within that directory

904
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,599
we have two other directories one is

905
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,119
automatic destinations

906
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
the other is custom destinations those

907
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
are two directories we can see that from

908
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,760
the attributes over here and then we can

909
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,359
see these are the different

910
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,359
lnk files we have uh over here okay

911
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,440
so that's for the ie user we can

912
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,440
check the uh the other user which is

913
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
joker

914
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
we can see same thing we have

915
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,760
this directory and the other directory

916
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
custom and automatic

917
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,119
these are by the way the directories

918
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,839
where our

919
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,240
jump lists are located so the jump the

920
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
lnk files are located

921
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,359
in the

922
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,520
let's say the drive letter users

923
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,480
username

924
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
application data roaming microsoft

925
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,520
windows and then

926
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,599
recent okay and the the jump list

927
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,520
are located within automatic

928
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,359
destinations which are

929
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,599
the jump lists which get created by

930
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,440
automatically by the application

931
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,920
and customer those that get created by

932
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,359
let's say the user

933
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,960
themselves okay so what do we need to do

934
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,760
with this

935
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,240
let's use now the tool again so what i'm

936
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,880
gonna do

937
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,560
is if i use by the way just one uh

938
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,200
let's say one file so if i do this and

939
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
then

940
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,839
recent and it's firing maybe

941
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,960
like just this one if i run the command

942
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,760
against

943
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,119
this file so it will it will go past

944
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,680
all of this and give me a lot of output

945
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,480
all of these outputs by the way

946
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
all of the this details that you are

947
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
seeing here

948
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,000
is stored within this lk file okay

949
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,599
and le cmd or eric's tool is

950
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,839
going into this file which is a binary

951
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,800
file by the way

952
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
it has a certain structure all of the

953
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
structure if you

954
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,800
want to understand that or go into more

955
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,040
details about this by the way

956
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,320
also eric has a lot of links to them

957
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
or you can just by the way search for

958
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,320
lnk file format

959
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,440
you will land on the page for for that

960
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
and i think it's uh

961
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
if i remember i forgot the name but it's

962
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,640
done by one of the

963
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
folks working at uh google and i think

964
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,119
he wrote a lot of these uh file formats

965
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,800
he's the one that's writing a lot of

966
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,119
these file formats so eric goes

967
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,960
passes all of that but this is for us

968
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
one single file

969
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,880
if we want to pass again the whole

970
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
directory so what we will be doing

971
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,079
is i'm going to change this to d

972
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,440
so that way we'll pass the whole

973
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,680
directory that's number one

974
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,640
i'm gonna call i'm gonna store it in a

975
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,200
csv file so i'm going to

976
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,280
use minus minus csv f to give it a

977
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,240
uh let's say a name and i'm going to say

978
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,119
lnk

979
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,760
or you can let's actually create a

980
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,960
directory on our desktop so we can this

981
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
way

982
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,680
store our results in there i know the

983
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,760
tool will create that so let's just do

984
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,280
this

985
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,520
eric's tool by the way we'll do that if

986
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,720
you do the

987
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,359
location is not already there and let's

988
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:25,839
say

989
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,800
uh this is the ie user

990
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,079
lnk dot csv file that's what i'm going

991
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,359
to call it

992
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,160
maybe so you can see this let me do it

993
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,359
this way

994
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,920
okay and then the location where i'm

995
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,560
going to store this is on my

996
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,920
vm's desktop results that's where i'm

997
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,400
going to store this

998
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
so what this will do it's going to go

999
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
over uh

1000
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,040
and i forgot to put

1001
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,040
the minus minus csv

1002
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,079
okay so now what this is

1003
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,440
it's by the way it's because i minimized

1004
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,480
the

1005
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,200
or i would say

1006
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
change the screen resolution this is

1007
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
what's happening i hope you can

1008
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,720
you are able to see what's being done so

1009
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
what i'm doing is i'm specifying the

1010
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,920
path where

1011
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
the evidence is located telling it i

1012
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,880
want to pass the whole directory

1013
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,800
i want the results to be stored in this

1014
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
file okay

1015
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,119
i want you to put this file as a csv

1016
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:33,599
file

1017
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,400
in this directory so if we hit now enter

1018
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,960
the tool will go uh parse all of that

1019
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,480
and you can see now

1020
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
it's stored in this file so that's one

1021
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,280
let's change this

1022
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,800
let's change this to our other user

1023
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,160
so we now will change this to joker

1024
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
and say this is our joker user

1025
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,720
okay same location but the user is

1026
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,359
different now

1027
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,640
okay what did i do here oh good

1028
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,720
and then we want it in the same location

1029
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,480
we can do that

1030
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,280
so now we are storing these uh

1031
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,800
csv files in

1032
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,960
let's bring this over here in this

1033
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,119
directory we can see we have

1034
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,760
the files over here that's one let's go

1035
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,800
to the tools again

1036
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,040
because eric also again like i said you

1037
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
can run really

1038
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,520
the whole windows forensics session here

1039
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,119
just using eric's tools you

1040
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,560
really don't need anything else uh

1041
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,119
but sometimes it's good to see other

1042
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,000
tools maybe

1043
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,880
that's up to you especially if you are

1044
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,480
learning and also probably if you are

1045
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,520
validating

1046
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,720
even though i would say uh

1047
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,760
even in times where bugs were found

1048
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,480
uh if you just send them to eric he will

1049
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,319
respond immediately or

1050
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,079
like in minutes i've i've seen that over

1051
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,040
the years

1052
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,359
and he'll respond back and fix that or

1053
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,839
he will ask you for

1054
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,119
a data set or a sample to do the test

1055
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,200
and get that fixed so here we can see

1056
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,440
that now we have

1057
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,000
the lnk files for this user and we have

1058
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,440
the lnk files

1059
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
for the other user so you can see these

1060
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,079
are listed in a tool called timeline

1061
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,040
explorer

1062
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,440
now what this timeline explorer is in

1063
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,640
the past i would say

1064
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,760
at least for my i speak up for myself

1065
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,480
uh we mostly tend to use uh

1066
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,520
an excel sheet to open these

1067
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,400
csv files and pass them and do filtering

1068
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,079
and searching in them

1069
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,640
that could all be done today with

1070
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,480
timeline explorer so you really don't

1071
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,200
need

1072
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,599
excel so if you even don't have a

1073
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,359
license for microsoft excel you don't

1074
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,240
need that

1075
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,359
this is far better in my opinion than

1076
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,560
that

1077
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,040
and i will i'm not sure i will be able

1078
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,839
to

1079
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,040
uh let's say show all of or

1080
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,720
showcase all of the features of it

1081
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
because we don't have

1082
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,759
time for all of that but

1083
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,480
i have a question so is this timeline is

1084
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,520
this the big timeline or not yet

1085
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,119
no no this is not that uh not not the

1086
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,960
the super timeline if that's what you're

1087
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,640
talking about yes yes yes

1088
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,680
okay so we're still in this phase

1089
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
because why

1090
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,800
yeah go ahead leila because

1091
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,720
people are still following up so we are

1092
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,319
now in which stage in the

1093
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,079
uh investigation still pulling

1094
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,520
out some data related to document

1095
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,839
activity or user activity related to

1096
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,000
documents

1097
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,240
a general step just looking what has

1098
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,680
been going in terms of

1099
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,280
files right activities by the two users

1100
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,720
exactly yeah okay

1101
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,319
so yeah the super timeline or big

1102
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,839
timeline yes i know

1103
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,119
yeah they i haven't done that yet okay

1104
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,520
good can i continue

1105
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,960
uh yes if you want me i have two

1106
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
questions maybe they will uh

1107
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,400
they will add they will enrich the

1108
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
discussion we have so many questions so

1109
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,800
just to

1110
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,640
uh so is there any better approach for

1111
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,920
uh considering because this image has

1112
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,960
more than one pro

1113
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,720
more than one user profile is there a

1114
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,800
better approach to compare or to look at

1115
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,400
the different activities or to compare

1116
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
between different users

1117
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,079
or this is you mean by

1118
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,240
pulling the data out and looking at them

1119
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,720
i think so this is the question by emmy

1120
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,400
uh her question is is there

1121
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,040
any better approach if that's a server

1122
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,839
image

1123
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,839
because a server image would have more

1124
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,640
users i think

1125
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,800
uh again then that's the funny thing is

1126
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,280
you can also use eric has another tool

1127
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,640
called cape

1128
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,880
and you can you can i would say

1129
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,240
configure cape to

1130
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,440
go pull the artifact the exact artifacts

1131
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,480
that you need

1132
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,839
from every single uh

1133
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,839
every single user and every single

1134
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,839
location that you're interested in

1135
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,400
this approach is more of a let's say an

1136
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,640
educational one so that's what that's

1137
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,000
uh we go past each one but if

1138
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,480
if you're uh if you wanna if you know

1139
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,920
what you're doing and

1140
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,599
you you want to speed things up then i

1141
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,599
would say go use cape

1142
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,880
uh and pull all the artifacts that you

1143
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,359
need

1144
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,560
and then just focus on them okay

1145
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,760
i hope your questions on okay we'll see

1146
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,240
if

1147
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,400
amy wants to add more we have two

1148
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,280
questions on

1149
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,560
uh the link file the first one is the

1150
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,359
dot link file has any way is has any is

1151
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,280
an in any way related to software

1152
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,760
link as we say in linux this is number

1153
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
one

1154
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,160
uh number two what does mac address and

1155
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,760
linux files mean

1156
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,160
what if computer have two networks cards

1157
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,079
[Music]

1158
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,359
can you repeat that again please i might

1159
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,559
have updated one

1160
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,920
okay the first question is

1161
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,119
uh the file this thing the link file uh

1162
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,599
is in any way related to the soft hard

1163
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,480
link as we say in linux

1164
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah it is it's not a hard link it's a

1165
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,160
soft link

1166
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,040
okay this is number one number two what

1167
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,280
does mac address

1168
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,400
and rank files mean what if computer

1169
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,640
have two network cards

1170
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,520
uh i would say it will depend on which

1171
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
probably they will both both be listed

1172
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,400
there i haven't seen that honestly

1173
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,280
so i'm not sure if uh if they will be

1174
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,079
both listed

1175
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,200
what they might be or the one that i

1176
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,880
would say the main

1177
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,960
mac address could be listed i'll need to

1178
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,559
see

1179
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,280
a case with with that there so i can i

1180
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,400
can validate that

1181
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,880
or provide a i would say an accurate

1182
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,240
quest an answer to that

1183
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,280
i have a question actually i it's been a

1184
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,760
while since i worked on this

1185
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,280
the mtf the master table file

1186
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
we can see that information from the

1187
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,000
from the timeline explorer on the files

1188
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,559
that one has been created modified etc

1189
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,240
or do we need to take into anything into

1190
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,839
consideration when we look at the time

1191
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,319
and dates

1192
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,960
uh you mean you mean the lnk files

1193
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
yes

1194
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,599
excuse me do you mean the lnk files

1195
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,720
themselves

1196
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,240
yes okay yeah you can definitely

1197
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,280
find them in the mft you can find them

1198
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,480
over there

1199
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,559
or you can just find them in in the

1200
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,319
artifact itself

1201
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,040
it's really up to you uh i would say

1202
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,319
file system forensics is a little bit uh

1203
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,839
not that easy people try to avoid and

1204
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,839
you you if you probably ask a lot of

1205
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,280
investigators

1206
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,480
and not many really dive i don't know

1207
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,280
there is no like a survey that says how

1208
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,079
many people

1209
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,440
uh dive into that much of details

1210
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,319
how many not it will depend on really

1211
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,760
the case you have

1212
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,040
uh but it's a it's a complicated

1213
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,400
more much more complicated than

1214
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,880
looking at the artifacts on the os layer

1215
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,440
because

1216
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,319
the more you dig deeper to reach the

1217
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,119
disk

1218
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,760
layer so the more you reach the disk

1219
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,240
layer

1220
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,000
the more i would say it's going to be

1221
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,440
more complicated

1222
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,720
we are here looking at the artifacts

1223
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,800
on the operating system layer which is

1224
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,559
much easier for us

1225
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,640
as humans the more you go down that path

1226
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,960
uh like from os to the file system from

1227
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,079
the file system

1228
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,839
to the volume from the volume to the

1229
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,440
disk etc

1230
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,319
the more it will be more complicated but

1231
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,000
that doesn't mean that you can't do it

1232
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,040
it just means

1233
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,119
to require more time probably depending

1234
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,599
thank you sorry for the interruption but

1235
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,359
i think now we answered the questions we

1236
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,960
have

1237
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,240
okay uh let me try to by the way uh

1238
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,040
continue

1239
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,720
try to answer as much questions i know i

1240
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,839
know but the questions

1241
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:44,400
are accumulating so you just got to this

1242
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
people are still asking about the vm

1243
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,040
image the links

1244
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
so all of these details will be shared

1245
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
after the session

1246
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,520
and uh yeah we pointed that out at the

1247
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,880
beginning of the session but for the

1248
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
people who joined in late

1249
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
uh these details will be shared after

1250
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,079

follow doctor and you can practice

1254
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,000
you by yourself after the session uh one

1255
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,160
one word also about the resolution and

1256
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,680
if you can increase the phone

1257
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,520
if anyone is facing any issue please

1258

follow us on the

1259
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
in the live stream maybe it's it's

1260
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,480
better there

1261

1263
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,760
honest and clear with everyone attending

1264
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,880
here

1265
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,440
i have another appointment immediately

1266
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,079
after

1267
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,800
our session so i will leave once i get

1268
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,920
back home

1269
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
i will find a way to upload all the

1270
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,839
material for everyone who is

1271
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,520
attending or who was not able to attend

1272
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,000
so i will get that done but i won't get

1273
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,440
that done immediately

1274
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,760
after the session okay so just

1275
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,240
don't worry please

1276
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,359
i will just share everything i do later

1277
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:07,760
on

1278
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,640
okay so what i'm going to do here is

1279
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,960
actually just combine those two

1280
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,680
uh actually we have two length files now

1281
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,800
as you saw here in uh two csv files

1282
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,960
this one and this one and i just want to

1283
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
combine them so we can look at them as

1284
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
one single csv

1285
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,280
uh so i found this way we can do it this

1286
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,839
way

1287
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,040
i will share also the the

1288
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,680
let's say the the way this is being done

1289
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,559
uh

1290
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,040
the command in the in the document

1291
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,720
because it wasn't really in the document

1292
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,839
i also

1293
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,440
found the script to do another thing

1294
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,280
which i will also be

1295
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,160
sharing all of this will be shared again

1296
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,960
so

1297
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,640
whoever's following don't worry about

1298
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,520
that okay so what i want to do here is i

1299
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,440
want to combine those two csv

1300
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,160
files into one file uh so that way

1301
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,200
i can load them as one file in timeline

1302
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,880
explorer

1303
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
i know you might be saying why don't i

1304
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,319
just do copy and

1305
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,520
use the binary switch etc the

1306
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,800
the only reason uh i'm using this is

1307
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,839
each csv will have the header with uh

1308
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,680
the uh with the table entries

1309
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,559
for each one of them so this way i can

1310
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,760
do it without

1311
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,280
worrying about about that problem okay

1312
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,440
so what i'm going to do now is just

1313
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,640
combine these into one single file

1314
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,240
say call it users underscore

1315
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,000
lnk dot csv

1316
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,909
[Music]

1317
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,920
so why is this oh okay there's a

1318
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,480
okay we have now one uh one csv

1319
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,119
file as you can see here even the size

1320
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:07,839
is

1321
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,559
twice the size so now what we can do is

1322
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,599
load that one so if we go to open

1323
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,680
desktop results and open the

1324
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,280
users one so we don't need these anymore

1325
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,480
i'm going to close them

1326
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,920
i can now look at these uh by the

1327
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,000
way they all by their own you can see

1328
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,960
that these are

1329
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,720
ie users and these are from the joker

1330
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,960
uh one you can even by the way like even

1331
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,400
click on them and do some conditional

1332
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,440
highlighting

1333
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,000
so you can just say text contains maybe

1334
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,400
it's really up to you this is just some

1335
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,480
of the features that you can add

1336
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,760
let's call this green apply that

1337
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,839
so this way these are green and these

1338
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,040
are in some other

1339
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,880
format it's up to you really how you

1340
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,240
want to do this so

1341
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,280
if we look at these and we want to see

1342
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,599
which user was accessing some documents

1343
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,440
here so if we go to

1344
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,480
uh we go to the

1345
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,799
file or the local path so you can see

1346
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:17,599
here

1347
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,160
a common path we can see here these are

1348
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,880
some documents which have been accessed

1349
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,520
these are on on the other side our other

1350
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,160
user

1351
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,920
so we can see the user in

1352
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,839
the user in gray which is the ie user

1353
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,720
now has opened

1354
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,839
images while the user in green has

1355
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,280
opened confidential documents so we have

1356
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,280
now one proof by the way that the user

1357
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,799
joker that's the user okay that

1358
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,000
has opened these files okay and again we

1359
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,799
can see that

1360
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,079
in in in this

1361
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,160
location over here in the common path

1362
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,280
you can see that

1363
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,680
and by the way if you if there's let's

1364
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,319
say

1365
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,400
if this entry you're not interested in

1366
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,520
it you can just say

1367
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,559
hide that so this way you can hide this

1368
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,280
hide this column you can just hide it if

1369
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,119
you're not interested in it

1370
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,760
if you want to group your column so for

1371
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,480
example

1372
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,880
i know there's a question later on in

1373
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,160
the document saying

1374
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,319
were the files accessed from local drive

1375
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,200
or from

1376
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,319
a remote drive or a remote chair

1377
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,440
so we can see the device type again we

1378
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,520
can see if it's a fixed storage or

1379
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,480
if it's something different we can just

1380
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,559
right click and say group by this so now

1381
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,760
what happened

1382
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,280
is if we go back here we can see

1383
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,119
based on the drive type we can see that

1384
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,280
these are the drive these are the the

1385
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,640
documents or

1386
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,400
everything that was opened from a remote

1387
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,040
network or over the network so if we go

1388
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,559
over here you can see

1389
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,440
these were open from a remote location

1390
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,200
or from another location

1391
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,240
while these are all open from a local

1392
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,040
location

1393
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,240
okay and again uh which user these are

1394
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,799
the ones

1395
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,040
in green so it's clear we are now

1396
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,160
dealing with

1397
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,359
uh the user uh user joker

1398
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,480
okay so that's that's uh answer to

1399
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,920
uh part number one uh so that's one

1400
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,520
artifact which gives us

1401
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,760
idea of which which user opens which

1402
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,880
kind of documents we will go over others

1403
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,040
uh let's go use another tool

1404
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,559
uh let me open this one

1405
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,559
another because i don't want to keep

1406
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,920
jumping back and forth

1407
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,200
and if we go to

1408
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,920
okay so this time what we want to do is

1409
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,880
i want to

1410
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,559
open uh the lnk

1411
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,480
files so the lnk files are those

1412
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,160
shortcuts we want to

1413
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,720
open those and see what kind of details

1414
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,280
do we have

1415
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,920
inside them so we can use the tool

1416
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,640
called

1417
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,000
uh actually we did the lnk files

1418
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,440
uh we let's do the jump list sorry

1419
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,480
we already did that in case let's use

1420
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,280
jump list okay so we can we can do by

1421
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,079
the way

1422
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,280
a jump list explorer or you can use

1423
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,480
the jump list the

1424
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,599
jump list explorer the cmd one so if you

1425
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:32,880
want to

1426
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
run them from the command line you can

1427
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,200
use this but if you want to

1428
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,400
let's say open uh

1429
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,680
open them in jump list explorer which i

1430
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,440
want to just show you a different way

1431
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,720
not everything is eric has i would say

1432
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,440
the core

1433
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,480
of the tools and then he builds either a

1434
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,440
command line

1435
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,040
interface or a gui interface around his

1436
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,520
tools

1437
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,200
so this is one of the other tools that

1438
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
we can use if we go

1439
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,839
and try to load again the

1440
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,599
f and go to users go to let's say i

1441
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,040
user application data roaming

1442
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,960
and then go to microsoft go to windows

1443
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,240
and then if you try to go here to

1444
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,599
see we can't see even the

1445
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,520
the recent directory even if you try

1446
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,559
you won't be able to see that you can't

1447
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,760
see them over here

1448
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,920
so the way to work around this is i

1449
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,400
found the script

1450
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,880
that i will upload to the

1451
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,480
i will upload to

1452
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,520
also the share drive okay or wherever

1453
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,640
i'm going to share this

1454
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,430
data create

1455
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,559
[Music]

1456
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,960
jls or lnk

1457
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,520
for jump lists that's what i'm going to

1458
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,720
call it

1459
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,000
and then if i just copy i'm just also

1460
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,400
going to

1461
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,680
by the way copy where

1462
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,440
this was got from so if you go to stack

1463
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,200
overflow this is actually

1464
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,440
from where i got this script it's really

1465
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,400
not mine

1466
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,440
it will create a symbolic link for

1467
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,280
as you can see here let me maximize this

1468
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,480
a little bit

1469
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,960
so it's gonna let me just put these over

1470
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,319
here so you can see them

1471
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,920
i'm gonna create symbolic link for

1472
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,720
first the user joker roaming microsoft

1473
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,599
windows

1474
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,839
recent automatic destinations that's

1475
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,280
where our first

1476
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,680
our first jump lists are located and

1477
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,280
then the custom destinations

1478
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,839
that's also where our jump list is also

1479
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:46,880
located

1480
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,000
i want to put them all as lnk files or

1481
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,280
assembling things

1482
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,839
okay so it's really just a wrapper

1483
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,839
around the make link so if you

1484
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,839
know how to script make link do that if

1485
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,000
you don't this is one other way of doing

1486
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,880
that

1487
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,520
and then i'm gonna store the results on

1488
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:05,920
my

1489
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,400
c users i desktop uh let's put this in

1490
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,079
the results directory so

1491
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,280
this is gonna be over here okay and

1492
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,680
since we are interested in two users not

1493
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,559
just one

1494
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,359
okay we are interested in uh two users

1495
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,000
so i'm going to

1496
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,480
also change this to

1497
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,240
the ie user right because

1498
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,200
we want to pull both of these users and

1499
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,839
by the way

1500
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,680
one of the questions which one of you

1501
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,760
asked earlier was

1502
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,799
how can i like automate this or if i

1503
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,319
have a server with multiple

1504
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,720
users i would say use cape cape has

1505
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,760
lots of ways to configure this like you

1506
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,079
don't

1507
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,400
really need to type in the user you'll

1508
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,200
just use the

1509
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,400
uh the variable for the users and then

1510
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,000
it will go and then it will pass all of

1511
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,559
those for you for each single location

1512
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,599
and actually most of them is

1513
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,359
really just clicks if you use the gui

1514
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,760
tool as well so this is one way of doing

1515
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,319
this but it's really up to you

1516
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,839
now i'm gonna why did i even save it as

1517
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,799
the txt

1518
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,160
i'm gonna save it as ps1 yep

1519
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,200
and now let's go

1520
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,439
to

1521
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,839
so jump list explorer

1522
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,200
okay and we want to run

1523
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,319
our create symbolic links

1524
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,880
so it's gonna create the links okay uh

1525
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
forget about the

1526
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,200
uh saying that the file is already exist

1527
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,359
it's talking about by the way the

1528
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,920
the directory which we created now

1529
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,440
within the results

1530
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,440
this directory it's telling you that it

1531
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,799
already exists

1532
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,079
so what this did is it created lnk

1533
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,799
files pointing to those jump lists and

1534
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,079
now what i can do

1535
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,119
is i can just go grab all of them uh

1536
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,200
from uh from that directory so i can

1537
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,240
just say

1538
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,520
do this and i these might have some

1539
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,359
errors in them so that's why they cannot

1540
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,400
be passed

1541
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,839
and this way now i can grab all of them

1542
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,920
whether for the joker user or the other

1543
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,359
user ie user and

1544
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,319
have them all in front of me as you can

1545
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,559
see here we have this quick access we

1546
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,400
have notepad

1547
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,000
these are uh some of the applications

1548
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,880
if the id is already known uh because

1549
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
each application has

1550
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,000
uh a unique identifier which eric also

1551
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,799
attracts and

1552
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
i think a lot of other people also track

1553
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,079
you can find them online

1554
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,720
if the tool knows what type of

1555
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,400
application you are dealing with

1556
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,079
then the application id will appear

1557
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,920
the application name sorry will appear

1558
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,680
over here so you'll know that i'm

1559
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,119
dealing with notepad

1560
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,079
and this is a jump list for notepad

1561
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,200
which i mean

1562
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,280
this is notepad i'm sure everyone knows

1563
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,440
that so if this is a jump list for

1564
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,319
notepad

1565
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,119
by the way then it's going to be over

1566
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:11,760
here

1567
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,880
if it's for edge this is what edge uh

1568
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,079
the the jump list for edge are etc

1569
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,720
okay you can see also each one of them

1570
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,880
is showing you how many

1571
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,520
links are within those jump lists

1572
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,799
because

1573
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,039
those jump lists you can look at them as

1574
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,160
they are

1575
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,799
they it's a let's say it's a big file

1576
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,520
with a lot of

1577
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,760
other links within them pointing to

1578
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,039
other locations

1579
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,960
so it's telling you also how many links

1580
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,559
you have within those

1581
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,480
locations now in here for example we can

1582
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,119
see

1583
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,240
word wordpad and we can see this is for

1584
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,760
the user joker

1585
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,119
okay we can see that this user accessed

1586
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,839
all these confidential documents so we

1587
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,119
have actually now

1588
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,240
two evidence that the user joker

1589
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,039
accessed these confidential documents

1590
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:03,520
one

1591
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,039
was on from his computer

1592
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,400
or her computer or whatever and one

1593
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,440
or the others were from a network share

1594
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,000
which is the 192 168

1595
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,440
70 128 so we can see all of these files

1596
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,599
now also if you look at these probably

1597
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,359
if you look at the timestamps

1598
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,920
by the way for them you can infer from

1599
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,480
them that

1600
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,280
probably this file was first accessed

1601
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,720
and then copied

1602
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,319
to the joker system and then

1603
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,960
the the user opened them on their system

1604
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,760
so we can

1605
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,359
by the way just by looking at the

1606
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,119
timestamps okay

1607
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,720
we can infer that this is probably

1608
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,240
uh they are the same file

1609
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,319
and this file was first located on the

1610
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,240
network and then it was

1611
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,280
uh copied to the drive or to the user's

1612
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,000
drive

1613
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,480
and access from there and again this is

1614
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,599
how you'll find

1615
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,640
uh these jump lists uh if you look at

1616
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,799
any one of them for example

1617
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,760
maybe if you look at putty you can see

1618
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,319
uh

1619
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,839
what is the path or what what location

1620
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,079
maybe put he was accessing

1621
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,400
so you can see that putty was accessed

1622
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,880
from this location

1623
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,359
and so on and so forth so even like here

1624
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,200
this browser

1625
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,440
this image sorry so you can see here

1626
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,799
that the user

1627
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,720
joker also accessed the document called

1628
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,200
haha.png

1629
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,799
this case by the way was created by

1630
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,480
myself uh

1631
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,440
so we can see all of these details uh in

1632
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,960
here which prove

1633
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,319
when was uh which user was accessing

1634
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:42,960
this

1635
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,319
that's one and then from where was this

1636
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,599
uh also uh file accessed

1637
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,400
okay uh let's continue so these are uh

1638
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,079
different details you can see here by

1639
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,000
the way for each entry these are

1640
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
all different features available within

1641
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,400
those

1642
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,680
jump lists or link files which again

1643
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,319
eric's tools parse automatically and

1644
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,880
provide them to you so it's telling you

1645
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,119
when was this file created when was this

1646
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,160
file last modified

1647
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,400
these are all being by the way extracted

1648
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,839
from this uh

1649
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,319
from this jump list all of these data

1650
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,240
flags each one of them means something

1651
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,880
by the way

1652
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,359
each one of them will mean if there's a

1653
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,559
list if there's a

1654
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,440
let's say more paths to go dig deeper

1655
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:29,760
and

1656
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,400
uh parse them all of these are details

1657
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,200
uh

1658
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,520
eric's tool automatically will pass them

1659
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,640
for you

1660
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,240
uh you can see the file size icons

1661
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,880
uh showing show a window so when you

1662
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,240
open this application

1663
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,000
whether this window will like

1664
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,520
automatically expand or

1665
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,079
it will be minimized these are all

1666
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,359
listed over here

1667
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,400
the absolute path the local path all of

1668
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,119
these locat

1669
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,000
uh details are available now they will

1670
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
be different by the way depending on the

1671
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,920
type of file we are dealing with

1672
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,039
and the type of details available uh

1673
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,319
to you so now we have two the the uh

1674
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,000
two evidence so if you were to

1675
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,200
let's say put some

1676
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,600
let's say screenshot into your report

1677
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,719
for example

1678
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,158
i do prefer to use

1679
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:26,319
a tool which is called

1680
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,000
i keep forgetting the name snip and

1681
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,359
sketch

1682
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,479
because uh based on the recommendation

1683
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,799
from my son actually

1684
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:39,279
it will give you better i would say

1685
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,279
the resolution is better and you can

1686
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,520
like for example here you can then

1687
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,640
uh highlight on them you can say uh

1688
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,279
highlight this and stuff like that so

1689
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,679
you can

1690
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,479
you can add the highlights you want and

1691
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:52,880
like

1692
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,520
even if you and you can the good thing

1693
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,040
also about this by the way you can use

1694
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,399
multiple colors

1695
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,880
you can expand i'll leave that to you to

1696
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,560
check that out but but

1697
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,600
again you can use this and then

1698
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,960
copy this into your

1699
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,359
into your report so if we want to answer

1700
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,040
the first this is joker

1701
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,600
we have proof we have this proof number

1702
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,319
one

1703
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,520
but we definitely can add the lnk proof

1704
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,080
we didn't add that and you can do that

1705
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,719
later

1706
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,279
just because i want to be thoughtful of

1707
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,080
the time and i

1708
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,759
i'm trying to cover as much as i can

1709
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,238
in this session so we have two two

1710
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:33,279
artifacts

1711
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,520
which gave us answers about that but

1712
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,839
still we can we can get more so let's go

1713
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:38,238
dig

1714
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,759
into uh providing uh more

1715
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,839
let's say uh results

1716
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,158
for more artifacts and more details

1717
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,920
let's use another tool called registry

1718
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,600
explorer

1719
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,679
now since we know which user we are

1720
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:54,880
dealing with we can just

1721
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,520
dive into that user pull the data we are

1722
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,719
interested in

1723
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,280
and focus on on focus on that

1724
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,120
now all of i would say all of the users

1725
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,719
preferences configuration uh the changes

1726
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,320
that the user does on the user level

1727
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,600
are mostly i would say 99 i don't want

1728
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,560
to say 100

1729
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,840
just because i might be wrong and 99

1730
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,960
they will be stored in a registry file

1731
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,960
within the user's home directory called

1732
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,719
nt user dot dot

1733
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,440
so if we go and say we want to load that

1734
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,000
data

1735
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,520
that file so if we go to users

1736
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,440
and then now we are we know which user

1737
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,640
we are interested in

1738
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,000
so if we go to joker and then we

1739
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,120
get this end user the dot file and open

1740
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,280
it

1741
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,760
again eric automatically will pass this

1742
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,760
registry hive for you with all of the

1743
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,520
details inside

1744
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,560
this is by the way if you open for

1745
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,679
example

1746
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,679
let me just give you an idea what this

1747
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,679
is so if we open

1748
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,040
edit editor and if we go for example

1749
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,600
to a specific user so let's say we are

1750
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,960
dealing with this user

1751
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,199
okay and then this is the details by the

1752
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,719
way if you can see here

1753
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,120
this is the details that will be

1754
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,840
available to you

1755
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,080
underneath what elic has automatically

1756
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,440
uh parsed for you uh okay so this is

1757
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,280
uh the details that will be eric will

1758
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,520
uh this is again this is stored by the

1759
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,600
way in that end user.that file

1760
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,640
but for the running system for sure not

1761
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,040
the

1762
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,159
the joker user but just

1763
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,280
for the idea okay and all of the entries

1764
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,199
that you see in here they are the same

1765
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,000
ones

1766
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,880
that have been passed automatically for

1767
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,920
you you can

1768
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,120
use now eric's tool to

1769
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,520
dig into them and analyze them so they

1770
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,800
are just giving you a map

1771
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,719
now you might say what about this this

1772
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,080
is volatile so it will

1773
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,760
not be available once you turn off your

1774
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,719
system so that's one about how good this

1775
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:09,360
tool is

1776
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,480
too most of the tools

1777
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,400
most of these hives have a lot of

1778
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,000
bookmarks

1779
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,520
and you can also by the way

1780
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,920
you can also by the way create your own

1781
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,560
bookmarks so if let's say you find some

1782
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,199
interesting artifact and you want to

1783
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,480
bookmark that and

1784
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,920
let's say you're working with a team you

1785
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,560
can then share that with your team

1786
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,400
but by coincidence by the way i'm not

1787
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,000
sure how my mouse

1788
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,199
pointed to this but anyway we can see

1789
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:39,679
that

1790
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,600
these are by the way all different

1791
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,840
bookmarks these bookmarks will take you

1792
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,880
directly

1793
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,239
to locations where let's say you if you

1794
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:48,640
are

1795
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,880
looking for details about cd-rom burning

1796
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,239
if you just click on that it will take

1797
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,640
you there if you are looking about

1798
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,960
let's say recent documents which we are

1799
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,920
looking uh

1800
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,239
for an information about that just by

1801
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,640
clicking on it it will take you there

1802
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,920
now that's one two

1803
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,040
lots of the lots of these bookmarks or

1804
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,679
lots of

1805
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,800
uh the tool what it does it has a lot of

1806
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,920
by the way

1807
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,199
plugins built in them so

1808
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,960
these by the way the results you can see

1809
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,719
over here i know uh

1810
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,480
this one is uh i can't

1811
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,120
minimize this or oh i can move it around

1812
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:29,600
okay

1813
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,800
let's put this down here and okay so you

1814
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,760
can see

1815
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,360
now better so by just clicking on recent

1816
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,960
documents by the way you can see all of

1817
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,040
these results but these results really

1818
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,679
are being

1819
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,040
passed by a plugin he has a plugin which

1820
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,719
automatically goes

1821
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,080
into each one of these sub keys

1822
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,159
so there's a sub key for documents

1823
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,000
there's a sub key for pdfs

1824
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,360
png rtf and folders so you can see these

1825
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,600
recent docs this windows registry

1826
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,640
windows registry location or key is

1827
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,600
actually

1828
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,480
tracking all of those documents and it's

1829
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,040
also categorizing them based on

1830
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,199
the type of document we are dealing with

1831
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,719
so doc

1832
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,679
x we can see those uh pdf png rtf etc

1833
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,640
so we also just by looking in in here we

1834
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,159
can see the files that have been

1835
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,040
accessed so

1836
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,400
we can see the file or the the target

1837
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,320
file which is what the file

1838
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,600
uh this link or this entry is pointing

1839
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,000
to

1840
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,280
so we can see that this is the the file

1841
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:37,600
and

1842
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,840
this also gives us another proof that

1843
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,520
these confidential documents

1844
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,719
were accessed by this user if you would

1845
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,239
say i don't want to look at the plugin

1846
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:46,880
you can you know

1847
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,080
just go by each uh

1848
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,440
each recent document and then looking

1849
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,440
inside each key so if we go to

1850
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,320
document x we can see them and we can

1851
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,880
see even

1852
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,960
each one of them has a value because

1853
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,400
these are part of what

1854
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,960
is called a most recently used list

1855
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,840
mru's

1856
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,360
and they are being passed and displayed

1857
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,360
to you in that

1858
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,400
order uh and as you can see here

1859
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,080
even this is another thing about them

1860
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,400
are used by the way uh you can see here

1861
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,280
that

1862
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,719
and number two was let's say uh

1863
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,159
probably the last one uh created

1864
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,360
but it was the last the one that's

1865
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,400
in the uh in this opened it's the last

1866
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,520
one that was opened

1867
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,600
so that's why the id you can see it was

1868
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,800
zero uh

1869
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,320
over here and you can see these lnks or

1870
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,800
these

1871
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,080
entries actually will track the last one

1872
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,320
which was open so we can see actually

1873
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,600
that confidential zero four was the last

1874
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:47,920
one

1875
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,360
opened and when we talk about document x

1876
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,679
files and this is the date when it was

1877
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,120
open and this is when i

1878
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,280
created this uh this case

1879
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,920
sorry there are a few questions relevant

1880
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,000
to this maybe we need just a post for

1881
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,320
some some of these quick questions

1882
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,159
uh they are relevant to the time zone if

1883
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,560
the tool if we can capture the time zone

1884
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,120
and if the modification and creation

1885
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,719
gate can be tampered with

1886
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,679
so i don't know how if we can take these

1887
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,280
questions quickly

1888
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,159
and if we can also get these details

1889
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,360
with the ftk imager

1890
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,880
okay so timezone

1891
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,600
timezone you can either if

1892
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,920
let's say whoever gives you the image

1893
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,440
tells you about that

1894
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,640
that's good if if it's not given to you

1895
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,880
then what we can do is we can go to

1896
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,640
windows

1897
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,239
system 32

1898
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:51,678
and then go to config

1899
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,390
let's open this and

1900
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,960
[Music]

1901
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,719
okay and then go select system

1902
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,360
so let me open that and show you a

1903
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,679
little bit about the time

1904
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,679
time zone and then if we go to

1905
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,400
select the hive which is the system

1906
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,840
again there is also

1907
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,800
a bookmark for it and if we go to time

1908
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,320
zone information

1909
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,679
you can go over here and you can see

1910
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,480
uh the time zone which was being used

1911
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,199
over here

1912
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,840
so we can see here by the way it's using

1913
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,120
the pst times on so

1914
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,400
the pst time zone is the one that

1915
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,360
is actually being used that's one two to

1916
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,400
make sure you

1917
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,760
understand uh let's say whether

1918
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,239
uh daylight saving is active or not how

1919
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,239
you can interpret this

1920
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:49,440
is look at the the bias

1921
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,480
value which is 480 and look at the

1922
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,120
active time bias is also 480

1923
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,280
and we have the daylight bias which is

1924
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,480
-60

1925
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,520
now if daylight saving was active by the

1926
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,159
way then

1927
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,760
we will see the active time bias will be

1928
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,880
420

1929
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,560
because we need to subtract that from

1930
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,040
480 and that means we have

1931
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,800
uh my utc minus seven instead of minus

1932
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,440
eight

1933
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,480
this is what uh this is what

1934
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,960
this this is how you can interpret that

1935
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,920
this is one

1936
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,480
two these information by the way is

1937
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,320
being pulled from the

1938
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,679
t z uh our tz-res the tll

1939
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,719
file which if you go to the uh

1940
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,719
if you if let's say when you reference

1941
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,159
the minus 12

1942
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,679
minus 211 or minus 2 12 if you just by

1943
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,280
the way search for this online

1944
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,600
say timezone and put tz uh res

1945
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,679
which is i think it stands for timezone

1946
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:50,960
resolution

1947
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,080
dot dll then you'll see that the minus

1948
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,679
211 stands for the pdt

1949
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,800
which is when daylight saving in pacific

1950
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,480
daylight saving is active

1951
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,840
and if you go to -12

1952
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,320
212 i mean that's when it means to

1953
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,239
pacific standard time

1954
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,320
so that's how you can get the hands-on

1955
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,520
information about that otherwise it

1956
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,080
might be

1957
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,400
given to you yeah thank you doctor

1958
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,199
that's a couple

1959
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,800
is about how we can make sure that the

1960
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,719
creation date or modification rate of

1961
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,159
the files are not tampered

1962
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,400
with

1963
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,600
well you will need to uh that's uh i

1964
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,600
would say you'll need to probably

1965
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
you mean the time zone is not tampered

1966
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,719
or the file itself

1967
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,080
those are two different things by the

1968
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,760
way

1969
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,080
and the file is a small element of the

1970
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,199
files with the modification dates and

1971
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,880
so that means now we are digging into

1972
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,199
again we are uh moving away from the os

1973
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,239
layer

1974
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,040
going down to the file system layer and

1975
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,440
that

1976
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,520
means we need to since we are talking

1977
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,440
about ntfs

1978
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,800
then ntfs has actually uh uh

1979
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,600
for each file a two set of attributes

1980
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,239
and each attribute we can compare them

1981
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,440
uh if those time zones were modified

1982
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,120
you can uh notice that

1983
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,199
also you can use the uh the log file for

1984
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,760
ntfs because it's a journal file so you

1985
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,040
can use

1986
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,639
the attributes with the log file and

1987
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,360
find if there is any uh modifications in

1988
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:33,840
there

1989
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,080
now it's not that much it's easy said

1990
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,440
than done

1991
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,360
but just to answer that question

1992
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,120
currently thank you

1993
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,280
one last questions about ftk imager can

1994
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,719
we do the same job on

1995
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,400
get the same details with ftk image

1996
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,840
such as uh let's say the

1997
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,280
time the jump list

1998
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,800
timeline explorer i i wouldn't use by

1999
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,040
the way ftk imager to parse files

2000
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,239
because

2001
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,880
even though it does have a hex editor

2002
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,320
it's i wouldn't say even it's a

2003
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,440
really x editor but you can it's a hexa

2004
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,040
viewer

2005
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,320
so for example if we go to users

2006
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,679
and let's go to joker for example

2007
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,600
if you select decode this let's say

2008
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,560
executable you can see it's uh listing

2009
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:24,960
them

2010
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,320
as in hex below because

2011
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,600
we can say listed in hexaview or

2012
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,480
in whatever view if it's if it's a text

2013
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,400
file for example or an image

2014
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,000
we can say list that so we can

2015
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,280
we can have uh ftk listed

2016
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,400
in its own natural viewer but

2017
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,840
uh like an exe we can't do that

2018
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,239
because it will need to be executed so

2019
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:53,920
you can do this that's one

2020
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,880
two you can also for example use the hex

2021
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,840
interpreter

2022
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,040
so you can for example like select some

2023
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,000
values and

2024
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,040
get them interpreted over here

2025
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,520
if these are times then they will be

2026
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,159
automatic

2027
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,920
so as long as you know uh let's say

2028
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,920
where exactly uh the

2029
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,760
where exactly those bytes which

2030
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,600
represent the timestamp

2031
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,360
are located you can definitely do what

2032
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,120
uh jump list or any uh le cmd

2033
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,520
all of those tools are doing uh but

2034
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,199
that's a good thing about those tools

2035
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,639
they do them automatically

2036
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,199
uh for you you can do this but again

2037
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:35,679
it's

2038
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,360
not not an ideal way of looking at them

2039
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,639
you can also for example look at

2040
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,880
once you select a file you can look at

2041
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,639
these properties

2042
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,600
those are also different features some

2043
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,159
of them

2044
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,880
like here is telling you what is the mft

2045
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,360
record if you are interested about

2046
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,000
file system related data it's telling

2047
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,760
you whether it's resident

2048
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,159
uh which means whether it's stored

2049
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,080
within the mft or it's stored

2050
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,159
outside the mft a lot of really

2051
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,840
different uh details

2052
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,880
but these are all gonna go dive into i

2053
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,840
would say

2054
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,120
uh file system uh file system layer

2055
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,840
which is very advanced or it's i would

2056
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,000
say

2057
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,880
will require more work than just to go

2058
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,280
click

2059
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,520
and do a couple of things easily like

2060
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,800
what we are doing now

2061
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,159
and again i don't recommend uh using

2062
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:35,040
ftk for this type of work you can use it

2063
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,400
just for the sake of let's say testing

2064
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,840
or just to

2065
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,120
see something quickly or checks but

2066
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,159
i would recommend using uh

2067
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,239
the best tool for the best to get the

2068
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,718
job done

2069
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,320
great so we have uh now

2070
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,239
we found in the windows registry

2071
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,040
uh again we found in the windows

2072
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,880
registry

2073
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,880
uh proof that the files were accessed we

2074
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,800
found lmk files proved that the files

2075
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,679
were accessed

2076
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,760
we found jump lists that the approved

2077
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,120
the file were accessed

2078
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,159
we can also prove that

2079
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,280
let's say the user if we want to maybe

2080
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,760
add

2081
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,679
more uh use that certain executable

2082
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,520
so what we can do is use another tool

2083
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,880
so where is

2084
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:39,520
okay so we can do

2085
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,880
pars which is p prefetch files so we're

2086
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,840
going to use p

2087
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
c and d and i can i will use another

2088
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,960
tool just

2089
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,800
so that again you can look at

2090
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,400
different tools and use them i

2091
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,480
i do recommend direct tools because of

2092
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,159
the accuracy of them

2093
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,880
the updates the new features he adds all

2094
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,080
the time but

2095
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,480
it's really up to you what tool you use

2096
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,520
uh i

2097
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,480
always even tell my students it's not

2098
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,840
really about the tool it's about

2099
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,880
understanding

2100
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,520
where those are artifacts are locating

2101
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,719
located

2102
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,040
and knowing how to extract them past

2103
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,480
them and use them to your advantage

2104
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,320
definitely the good tool will make your

2105
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,080
job much easier

2106
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,800
but that's up to you uh which tool you

2107
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,440
use

2108
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,040
so let's create another csv file

2109
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,960
i'm gonna call them prefetch dot csv

2110
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,480
okay minus minus csv and i'm gonna also

2111
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,600
store them

2112
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,960
on my users ie desktop results

2113
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,560
and we can parse all of those and then

2114
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,320
load them

2115
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,480
while this is being passed by the way

2116
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,320
let's use another tool

2117
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,600
just like i said so you don't don't say

2118
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,920
i'm just using these there are other

2119
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,639
tools like one prefetchy viewer

2120
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,679
i do recall it has some bugs but

2121
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,280
let's just give it a try

2122
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,000
so this is a gui currently what it's by

2123
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,400
the way loading just in case

2124
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,560
this is loading the prefetch files on

2125
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,760
the running machine

2126
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,360
so what you need to do is you need to

2127
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,560
change it to your uh

2128
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,520
uh the the path where your image is

2129
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,639
located so

2130
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,520
powers is on the f so you can just say f

2131
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,360
and leave everything as it is

2132
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,360
it's gonna automatically also pass them

2133
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,560
for you

2134
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,280
uh it's gonna list by the way in local

2135
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:37,760
time

2136
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,199
so if you want to switch to utc or gmt

2137
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,560
just go here and then

2138
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,080
you'll switch between local time and gmt

2139
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:50,159
so here one of the things that we saw is

2140
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,280
if we go back to our

2141
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,519
uh

2142
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,480
let's just pick this in the user and

2143
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,840
then go

2144
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,199
recent dots okay so one of the things is

2145
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:04,719
we we noticed that

2146
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,639
we opened uh these documents were rtf so

2147
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,000
they were using the uh

2148
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,920
the word document the windward excuse me

2149
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,520
and we also saw that by the way in

2150
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,159
windward so we saw it in the jump list

2151
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:22,560
that

2152
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,520
the wind world was opened so let's see

2153
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,560
uh

2154
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,960
that in prefetch files and now you might

2155
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,040
be asking what a prefetch file is

2156
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,080
again these are not

2157
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,560
things that microsoft is using to track

2158
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,280
you

2159
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,679
as a user even though they are they

2160
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:40,800
technically are

2161
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,040
but they are for user experience the

2162
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,239
idea behind

2163
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,639
i would say uh briefly what prefetch

2164
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:47,440
file is

2165
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,280
once you load an application sometimes

2166
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,560
that application

2167
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,560
requires a lot of setup requires a lot

2168
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,920
of files calling

2169
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,840
i need this that i need this library i

2170
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,199
need this library

2171
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:00,560
uh go fetch me this file etc and

2172
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,560
there's a lot of let's say behind the

2173
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,639
scene a lot of setup the system needs to

2174
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,440
prepare

2175
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,320
for this application in order to get it

2176
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,679
ready for the user

2177
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,920
so these prefetch files what what

2178
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,040
happens is

2179
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,800
the system is automatically there's a

2180
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,560
service running in the background

2181
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,000
it's monitoring your uh your execution

2182
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,560
so when you when you first time let's

2183
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,360
say

2184
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,280
uh double click on an application or you

2185
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,639
run an application

2186
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,280
what will happen is the this service

2187
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,880
which is running in the background

2188
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,639
will is monitoring what's happening

2189
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,560
within those couple of seconds six

2190
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,920
seconds etc

2191
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,800
and then it's gonna save those in a file

2192
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,400
which is called the prefix file

2193
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,280
so we can use that prefetch file as

2194
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,920
proof that this executable was actually

2195
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,480
executed now one thing to keep in mind

2196
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,239
about prefetch files

2197
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:54,560
is they are uh across the whole system

2198
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,760
they are not for a single user not like

2199
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,080
the

2200
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,520
jump list what we saw if you remember

2201
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,280
the jump lists

2202
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,080
the locations they point to a specific

2203
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,440
location within

2204
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,520
the home directory of the user so we

2205
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,800
know these

2206
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,840
artifacts are from joker or from ie user

2207
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,800
etc but this one is pulled from the

2208
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,560
windows prefetch directory

2209
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,480
so these are for the whole system so we

2210
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,639
need to keep that in mind

2211
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,199
one of the good things is to probably

2212
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:25,760
use

2213
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,800
is use that and track when the user was

2214
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,560
logged in and try to match

2215
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,639
was this application executed within the

2216
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:33,600
time frame

2217
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,040
the user has been logged in and also one

2218
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,719
uh important thing about user login

2219
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,080
is at the end by the way you can prove a

2220
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,560
user has been logged in

2221
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,520
we can definitely do that but you can't

2222
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,000
prove

2223
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,920
that so for example you can't prove that

2224
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,840
it was me who logged in

2225
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,159
because someone might have let's say

2226
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,880
stole my password and used it to log in

2227
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,360
so you can't uh what

2228
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,840
i would say you can't put me behind the

2229
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:06,960
keyboard

2230
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,280
and there's a good book about that i

2231
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,840
highly recommend if you just google it

2232
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,560
uh you can find it there's a good book

2233
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,920
about

2234
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,400
like putting the uh the suspect behind

2235
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,239
the keyboard

2236
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,040
i would say go and and find that book

2237
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,280
because again you will not be putting

2238
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,280
me behind the behind the keyboard you

2239
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,880
are actually

2240
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,639
proving that this user is the user

2241
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,000
that actually uh accessed access this

2242
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,199
uh this uh

2243
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,520
the user that has been has uh logged

2244
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,639
into the system

2245
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,159
okay so that keep keep that in mind okay

2246
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:50,080
and uh any questions

2247
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,639
so i can just

2248
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,239
uh

2249
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,040
yeah we got one no

2250
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,360
according to you which tool is best for

2251
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,159
windows linux mac

2252
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,638
for example

2253
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,480
that's relevant accord yeah which tool

2254
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,000
is best for windows

2255
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,679
linux and mac for forensics

2256
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,960
purposes i i didn't understand that

2257
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,480
honestly

2258
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,199
yeah maybe always maybe you can repeat

2259
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:30,080
the question again

2260
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,080
cleaner program that cleans up the

2261
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,159
registry entries

2262
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,600
uh cc cleaner yes

2263
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,199
but i don't know that's relevant to our

2264
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,080
topic again doctor

2265
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,239
it's so it's it's fine i will just give

2266
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,719
it my my

2267
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,080
my my answer to that uh so

2268
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,719
it will depend on the options you've

2269
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:03,520
used

2270
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,520
at the end though uh the uh

2271
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,800
you can you can think of the the windows

2272
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,000
registry as a

2273
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,280
file system by the way and look at those

2274
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,000
if i go back here a little bit and you

2275
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,520
can look at these

2276
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,600
you can look at the keys as folders and

2277
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,960
look at the values

2278
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,520
as files within those keys so when you

2279
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,040
delete

2280
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,960
so what ccleaner will do is we'll go and

2281
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,320
delete those files

2282
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,040
so uh all those entries so when you

2283
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:33,840
delete those

2284
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,880
unless they have been white

2285
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,239
okay then if you are if you know

2286
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:44,480
the structure of uh the registry files

2287
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,440
and how to parse uh how to find them and

2288
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,199
how to pass them then probably

2289
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,159
you can carve those registry uh those

2290
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:52,719
entries

2291
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,080
out and analyze them again

2292
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,679
if i go yeah yeah

2293
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,520
should i continue

2294
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,400
yes there are some some questions that

2295
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,520
are generated a bit

2296
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,280
so we can leave them till the end so we

2297
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,040
can move on okay i'll leave these

2298
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,560
general questions great uh but by the

2299
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,639
way the book i was mentioning i just

2300
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,000
uh because a lot i'm trying to focus on

2301
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,800
the

2302
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,520
workshop so i i just forgot the the

2303
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,400
author's name i apologize to brett

2304
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,760
the book is authored by brad shavers so

2305
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,679
if you are interested in that also go

2306
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,520
check it out

2307
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,960
and also brett has the dfir.training

2308
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,080
website which is a really good resource

2309
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,719
if you want to check for different uh

2310
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,880
details related to digital forensics and

2311
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,159
incident response

2312
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,639
okay so sorry brett i forgot your name

2313
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,080
just because

2314
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,880
a lot of things going now inside my head

2315
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,600
okay

2316
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,239
so uh we saw that uh again the uh

2317
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,800
though those rtf documents were accessed

2318
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,440
so

2319
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,239
if we check wordpad by the way we can

2320
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:06,800
see

2321
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,280
uh just by clicking on any of this by

2322
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:09,840
the way

2323
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,960
you can see that it will list all the

2324
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,840
files

2325
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,040
that have been accessed by this

2326
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,080
executable

2327
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,639
and you can like just filter them or

2328
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:21,679
sort them out

2329
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:25,280
and you can see that the the the wordpad

2330
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,800
was actually used

2331
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,239
to access the user's joker

2332
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:31,280
confidential.rtf

2333
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,960
rtf file so that document

2334
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,280
lnk proves it was accessed jump list

2335
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,880
proved it was accessed the registry

2336
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:39,600
approved

2337
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,719
it was accessed and we also now

2338
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,320
can see that word

2339
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,840
the word pad also proves it was accessed

2340
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,719
if we go back because i know by now this

2341
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,159
has

2342
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:57,920
done finished so if i go back to

2343
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,159
timeline explorer and load the file

2344
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,440
so if we load prefetch

2345
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:12,080
and if we go for example and search for

2346
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,960
wordpad.exe

2347
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,199
you can see it will automatically be

2348
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,800
listed here and it's

2349
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,639
as you can see it will also filter them

2350
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,639
this is a really good thing about

2351
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,840
eric's tool you can see how

2352
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,480
the executables name you can see how

2353
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,639
many times this executable was

2354
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,719
run the run count it's also available

2355
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,400
here just for the record

2356
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,040
it's also saying five not that i didn't

2357
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,760
uh

2358
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,840
i just didn't mention this so you can

2359
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,239
even track

2360
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,760
how many times this uh executable was

2361
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,840
executed you can see also

2362
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
when let's say the last time this

2363
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,040
executable

2364
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,360
was accessed uh the previous the

2365
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,560
previous previous

2366
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,440
uh it will track a couple of times how

2367
01:35:59,440 --> 01:35:59,920
many

2368
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,239
uh on windows 10 i think they are eight

2369
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,239
if if i'm not

2370
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,960
wrong and it will then if you go to the

2371
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,840
end

2372
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,600
it will show you if you double click on

2373
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,239
this

2374
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,800
by the way it will list all of the files

2375
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
that have been accessed

2376
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,719
by that executable you can either

2377
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,800
take them out like this

2378
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,119
i copy them and go to notepad

2379
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,719
and just paste them here and then dig

2380
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,480
deeper into them or

2381
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,880
now since you are interested in this

2382
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,159
executable

2383
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:40,560
what you can do is actually go back

2384
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,159
to eric's tool again

2385
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:47,280
go back and this time instead of

2386
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,840
doing the d using the f and

2387
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,480
say uh wordpad

2388
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,440
okay and then we don't need this anymore

2389
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,520
we can just dump it over here

2390
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,080
the results and you can see also here

2391
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,800
it will list uh those files that were

2392
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,840
accessed for you

2393
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,880
you can also by the way if i just uh let

2394
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,560
me just remember the keyword

2395
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,760
uh i think it's minus k exactly so if

2396
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,719
let's say

2397
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,960
you know what you're exactly looking for

2398
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,560
you know the keyword

2399
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,480
because eric has some built-in keywords

2400
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,000
especially like tmp

2401
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,880
etc they will get highlighted for you so

2402
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,960
you know the exact keyword and let's say

2403
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,440
we know we want to look for a

2404
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,960
confidential so if we say

2405
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,719
let's just do this for example and if we

2406
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,239
run it now

2407
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,520
what it will do is it's gonna highlight

2408
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,760
as you can see here it's gonna highlight

2409
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,679
that entry

2410
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,960
for you same thing by the way but uh

2411
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,679
what this is doing is it's parsing just

2412
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:54,800
one single

2413
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,880
uh prefetch file is telling you this is

2414
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,920
the command line

2415
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,639
that you use these are the keywords like

2416
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:01,280
i said

2417
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,560
these uh temp tmp those are built in

2418
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,679
uh eric has them built in it's telling

2419
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,760
you which file has been processed

2420
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,840
it's telling you when was this file

2421
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,880
created

2422
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,080
so the creation time by the way infers

2423
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,880
when was

2424
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,600
the first time this executable was

2425
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,639
executed

2426
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,119
modification time let's say when the

2427
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,320
executable was

2428
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,520
executed next time that's

2429
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,239
maybe one if there were changes it will

2430
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,199
be

2431
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,080
modified and here because it's showing

2432
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,480
that

2433
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,960
now we are accessing it so it's telling

2434
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,440
us that it's been accessed on

2435
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,080
july 4th which is today is telling you

2436
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,239
the executable name the hash value

2437
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:47,360
which is a kind of a hash for each

2438
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,400
executable

2439
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,960
there's a complex algorithm behind it

2440
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,370
that gets

2441
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:55,040
[Music]

2442
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,239
gets used to calculate those

2443
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,320
those executables i would say basically

2444
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,000
if they are run

2445
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,760
probably from two different locations

2446
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,840
they might have two different hash

2447
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,639
values

2448
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:08,400
it's telling you the file size and it's

2449
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,800
telling you also that this is for

2450
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,600
windows 10. the wrong count is five it's

2451
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,560
telling you

2452
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,840
uh the first or let's say going back

2453
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,119
from the most recent

2454
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,239
and then uh going back from there

2455
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,639
where is it located all of these are and

2456
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,000
the directories that have been

2457
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,600
passed or found within that

2458
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,560
prefetch file these are all listed over

2459
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,000
here

2460
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,520
so that's for those questions if you

2461
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,800
now like again like i said

2462
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,920
we can prove that joker was used we have

2463
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,040
the allen keys

2464
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,800
here we have the uh the recent documents

2465
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,440
in the end

2466
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,320
user. from the windows registry you can

2467
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,520
answer those

2468
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,840
was it from a local drive or a network

2469
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,560
drive

2470
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,520
we saw that the user accessed both of

2471
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,080
them

2472
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:04,080
the user access some jump list from

2473
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,639
sorry some files from the network and

2474
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,800
some files from the local drive

2475
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,520
so you can add those answers over here

2476
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,679
what proves to have you have to support

2477
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:14,560
your

2478
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,119
you can just go and explain that to what

2479
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:17,600
i

2480
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,560
what i have been talking about and now

2481
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,400
list all files that were accessed

2482
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,360
here i just want you to like go take

2483
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,639
those files out and

2484
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,440
like list them provide two evidence that

2485
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,199
prove that we actually provided more

2486
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:31,920
than two

2487
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,639
so we are good to go with that which

2488
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,800
application was used to open any of the

2489
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,400
confidential documents

2490
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,400
we saw that uh rtf

2491
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:46,159
uh those rtf documents were used uh

2492
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,639
windward was used to open them so the

2493
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,960
answer for here is when

2494
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,360
word

2495
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,560
when word okay dot exe

2496
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,000
was used to open that the next three

2497
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,639
questions are related to the

2498
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,520
image with this text found in the user

2499
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,280
directory

2500
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,920
here really just added more to just make

2501
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:12,480
sure

2502
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,960
let's say whoever is working on this

2503
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,679
case

2504
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:17,920
this was the case i gave to my students

2505
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,440
definitely

2506
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,239
that they use also different tools and

2507
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,480
understand what they are working is

2508
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,400
what's the full path for the file of

2509
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,719
interest so if we go back to

2510
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,719
windows uh f

2511
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,760
users joker and

2512
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,880
it was this was the image by the way

2513
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,159
that has that text in there we saw it

2514
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,159
actually in ftk imager

2515
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:49,040
uh it's definitely not a good idea to

2516
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,320
double click on it

2517
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,639
so but i know it's an image that's why i

2518
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:53,760
did that

2519
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,840
so the full path will be this

2520
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,719
and but this will be over here

2521
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,080
and this will be haha png and it's going

2522
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,440
to be like c

2523
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,679
now it's f just because that's where

2524
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,040
it's mounted on

2525
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,880
what is the volume serial number where

2526
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,159
the file exists

2527
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,000
this one actually you can you can see

2528
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,280
that in

2529
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,440
the allen key so if you go back here by

2530
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,119
the way

2531
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:25,360
and i'm not sure if we hided that

2532
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,839
or not but let's see

2533
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:43,119
let's see if i actually

2534
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:46,880
there's nothing selected

2535
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,840
um

2536
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,760
these are running case right now

2537
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,360
in the filter here i just need to

2538
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,159
ungroup them

2539
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,000
let's see what happened here

2540
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,130
by this column i don't want that because

2541
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:28,659
[Music]

2542
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,040
yeah volunteering number here it is okay

2543
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:33,920
great

2544
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,880
so group by this column we can do that

2545
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,719
and

2546
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,840
so we were interested in the file called

2547
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,000
let me just maximize this again

2548
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,040
a file called the png

2549
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,400
will automatically be selected so

2550
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,440
we can see here that

2551
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,239
this is the volume serial number uh you

2552
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:57,679
can do this by the way or you

2553
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,639
since you know which uh which file you

2554
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,480
are interested in then you can just go

2555
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,119
run lnk uh l e c m d

2556
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,080
against that specific file and it will

2557
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,440
automatically also

2558
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,520
get that serial number for you so you

2559
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,920
can also do that

2560
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,480
what is our questions here so we have

2561
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,440
that

2562
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,280
what are the modified access and

2563
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,800
creation

2564
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,760
market timestamps in utc for the file so

2565
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,600
what you can do here

2566
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,360
this is one question that could be

2567
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,960
answered with

2568
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,080
ftk imager if you if you want

2569
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:40,480
is by just clicking on the image

2570
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,760
excuse me and if you just go by the way

2571
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,880
over here uh you can see that these are

2572
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,440
the dates when it was accessed it when

2573
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,040
it was created that one

2574
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,080
it was modified okay so you can see that

2575
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,280
uh automatically uh in here so those are

2576
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,119
by the way the answers to that question

2577
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:04,159
the the decode.exe application was used

2578
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,000
by one of the users provide

2579
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,360
evidence to uh the next four questions

2580
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,000
below

2581
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,159
be careful this is a tricky question

2582
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,119
it's really

2583
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:16,239
the idea here what i did is

2584
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,960
if you look so decode.txt is an

2585
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,960
executable so what we need to do

2586
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,520
if we look at prefetch files so if we

2587
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,880
look at prefetch files

2588
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,440
let's go to the beginning and say decode

2589
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,480
we don't see

2590
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,360
any any tool called decode being

2591
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,600
executed that's not available

2592
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,719
but we do see this dd

2593
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,760
dot exe executable

2594
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,679
that's one but how do we prove that they

2595
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:42,960
are the same tool

2596
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,480
so what happens here is the reason why i

2597
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,840
said it's tricky

2598
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,199
is what happens is happened is

2599
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,679
probably the user joker copied this file

2600
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:54,520
named it

2601
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,880
dd.executable and then run that

2602
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,760
executable

2603
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,440
you can think of this as a way to

2604
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,960
masquerade whatever the

2605
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,920
user was planning on doing so that way

2606
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,000
when you search for that executable

2607
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,960
you won't find it but what we can do

2608
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,080
here

2609
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,040
is because we didn't find it in prefetch

2610
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,840
so what we can do

2611
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,719
is use a hex editor i we use at the

2612
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:19,600
college

2613
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,080
and i would say everywhere the zero one

2614
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,800
zero editor you can download a trial

2615
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,040
version for 30 days

2616
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,119
and what i will do is i'm going to open

2617
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,960
those files so if i go

2618
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,560
and open those two files

2619
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,000
users and then joker and then open

2620
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,520
pd and decode so let's open them

2621
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,520
so we have these two files what i'm

2622
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,560
going to do is i'm going to do a

2623
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,159
comparison between them

2624
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:48,800
okay so what we can do is do compare

2625
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,600
files

2626
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,440
so we want to compare these and i'm

2627
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,960
going to do a bite by byte

2628
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,040
there are as you can see here lots of

2629
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,880
other options if you want to

2630
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,520
uh tweak around and play with it so

2631
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,520
we're going to compare d code with dd if

2632
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,440
we do the comparison

2633
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,280
it did a comparison and it's telling you

2634
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,639
it's a match there is no

2635
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,440
like no modifications in there that's

2636
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,239
one

2637
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,280
two to we can also do uh

2638
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,040
checksums so we can do uh a checksum for

2639
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,040
calculating the nd5

2640
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:23,840
and let's say sha1 for both of them and

2641
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,480
just my timer and we can see that these

2642
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,480
are the md5 and the shaft for both of

2643
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,280
them

2644
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,119
now let's say just an example to prove

2645
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:33,600
that

2646
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,000
this is being calculated or the uh let's

2647
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,880
say

2648
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,360
the comparison is being done correctly

2649
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,560
let's say you go

2650
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,440
and modify this byte let's say you do

2651
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,560
like

2652
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,600
a a just something like that and now if

2653
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,440
i do a comparison again so if i do a

2654
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,880
compare between them again

2655
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,360
again i want to compare bite by byte and

2656
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,639
do comparison

2657
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,239
see the tool what it's telling you this

2658
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,159
is by the way

2659
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,320
zero one zero has a lot of great

2660
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,760
features i might do

2661
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,800
a whole series about

2662
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,040
how to use it because again we use it a

2663
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,480
lot at the college

2664
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,320
you can see the good thing about this is

2665
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,760
telling you that

2666
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,080
from this location to this location by

2667
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,000
the way the size isn't my

2668
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,360
the the files are a match but we have

2669
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,600
over here and it's highlighting uh those

2670
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,199
are the two bytes which are actually

2671
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:24,000
different

2672
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,840
and then it's also telling you

2673
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,360
everything else after that

2674
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,320
are also a match so even if those if

2675
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,400
those files were not a match or if they

2676
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,600
were modified

2677
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,840
in a simple way you can do that there

2678
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
are definitely

2679
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,199
more better ways to do that

2680
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,719
more ways i would say to compare two

2681
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:44,400
executables especially

2682
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,239
but this is a basic way to do that with

2683
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:52,159
a 0 1 0 editor so if i go back to the

2684
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:53,520
questions

2685
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,440
uh which user did run the

2686
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,320
the this application if we look at the

2687
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,320
executable

2688
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,360
it was run by it wasn't the joker's

2689
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,719
directory that's one

2690
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,040
we just need to make sure that the time

2691
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,840
when the user joker was logged in

2692
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,080
maps with the time of the execution or

2693
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,440
it's within that time frame

2694
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,599
so that proves that and you can get that

2695
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:18,880
by the way from

2696
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,360
uh the sam file which is another

2697
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,080
registry file that tracks all of the

2698
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:28,480
different user details uh

2699
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,360
the the details about the user uh so

2700
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,920
that's one

2701
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,920
uh also how many times

2702
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,800
was it used again we can see that here

2703
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,480
how many times it was used the wrong

2704
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,679
counter says one

2705
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,320
you can also use pecmd to do that this

2706
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,159
is again just another way

2707
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:49,920
just so you don't say i'm biased even

2708
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,080
though i am biased to alex tools to be

2709
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,360
honest with you

2710
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,920
one was at last used you can you can

2711
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:56,960
find that

2712
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,560
over here which is when was this last

2713
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,360
used

2714
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,239
and where was this application located

2715
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:07,920
you can just go and put that full path

2716
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,280
over there which is it was

2717
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:14,400
in c users

2718
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:19,280
joker and then dd.exe

2719
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,960
so that's i would say it for

2720
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,560
the session i tried i would say

2721
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,280
to go over the tools why we use them a

2722
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,280
little bit about details about

2723
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,159
why we are passing this information uh

2724
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,840
how you can

2725
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,320
combine all of this together the only

2726
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,679
thing probably we didn't do

2727
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:43,360
is uh is do us like a super timeline

2728
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,119
you can do that or what i would

2729
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:46,480
recommend by the way

2730
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,760
that's my opinion is you can especially

2731
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,119
if you have two systems or two

2732
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,639
workstations to work with

2733
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,320
it depends on where you work and

2734
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,199
your work environment but we do have

2735
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:00,800
that so what i can do

2736
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,920
is have a super super timeline being

2737
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,360
generated while i

2738
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:09,360
go and look at the artifacts in

2739
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,159
let's say the different locations one by

2740
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,080
one by a time depending on

2741
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,760
what am i looking for what am i trying

2742
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,440
to answer uh

2743
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:20,239
etc and then once the super timeline is

2744
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:21,119
available

2745
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,920
i will just pull that in and look at

2746
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,239
that

2747
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:27,520
and figure everything out in a coral

2748
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,040
chronological uh kind of order

2749
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,080
so uh yeah that's it for the

2750
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:37,679
session i think we have

2751
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,320
a couple of minutes left if there's any

2752
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,080
question that i can

2753
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:45,199
uh quickly answer

2754
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,760
so thank you so much doctor

2755
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,599
for the wonderful workshop that's really

2756
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,920
helpful there are many questions coming

2757
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:58,159
in which are

2758
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:01,440
one question about if there's a tool

2759
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,840
uh recommended to that come works across

2760
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,119
all platforms like

2761
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,400
linux mac and windows if there's a tool

2762
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,040
you

2763
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,199
you would recommend that's compatible

2764
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:12,560
with all platforms what

2765
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,440
was it it will have to be a commercial

2766
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,840
tool i don't know of uh

2767
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,560
i don't know of a like a open source

2768
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,320
tool that can do that

2769
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,760
but if you are talking about a

2770
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,679
commercial tool then axiom

2771
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,380
magnets uh axiom uh

2772
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,679
[Music]

2773
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:33,599
and i know it does windows mac and

2774
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:37,040
uh also even mobile and even uh

2775
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,440
a couple of months ago they announced

2776
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,960
that now it does

2777
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,159
linux we also use axiom at the college

2778
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,320
and it's a it's a really great tool by

2779
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,040
the way it also makes your life easier

2780
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,560
this is by the way not kind of any

2781
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:56,080
uh i i'm not i don't work for axiom

2782
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,960
so i'm not trying to sell you axiom but

2783
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,719
we use axiom at the college we

2784
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,199
i would say we have most of the tools at

2785
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:04,000
the college

2786
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,199
uh but again we do not

2787
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,080
tell our student which exact tool to use

2788
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,400
we

2789
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,040
show them the tools then it's up to you

2790
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,560
to use it just give me the answer

2791
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,360
because

2792
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,040
regardless what tool you use you should

2793
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,840
come up with the same exact answers

2794
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,199
so axiom is what i would say can

2795
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,719
do all three windows linux and

2796
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,920
and mark yeah some people are asking

2797
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,520
about that book that you have just

2798
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,199
just mentioned i think i have shared

2799
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:35,360
them in the chat for everyone

2800
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,040
so i hope you can i would like the book

2801
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,639
uh i will add

2802
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,960
a couple of books and a couple of

2803
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,639
websites i know

2804
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:46,000
elon has a good website as well so

2805
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,119
you have dfir dot training that's a good

2806
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:51,280
resource it's an excellent resource

2807
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:54,159
uh elon which if you google a few search

2808
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:55,599
on twitter

2809
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,880
dfir diva that's what her

2810
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,080
handle is she also keeps update

2811
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:05,840
there's also the monthly monthly focus

2812
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,760
on digital forensics where

2813
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,360
there are lots of names by the way so i

2814
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,280
do apologize to those folks

2815
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,960
out there that i don't remember their

2816
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,800
names uh

2817
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,719
what what he does is really a great

2818
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,320
thing is he monitors

2819
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,719
all of the let's say the blog posts all

2820
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:23,760
of the research

2821
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,159
that gets published every week every

2822
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:26,960
month

2823
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,199
and just summarize them for you i highly

2824
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:30,159
recommend

2825
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:34,239
you check that out uh i will add those

2826
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,760
into the list and also cyber fight w

2827
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,320
but that's probably a shameful plugin

2828
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,440
here

2829
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,520
our courses some of them are free some

2830
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,040
of them are not

2831
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:48,080
you can also check that one thing i can

2832
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,119
say about

2833
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:52,320
c5w is if you're a student

2834
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,880
and you can't afford any of our courses

2835
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,320
please just send me an email

2836
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,280
and i will waive that course for you so

2837
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:05,840
you'll get it for free

2838
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:15,520
there are questions about the dumping

2839
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,280
dumping the memory how to do a memory

2840
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,560
down if the

2841
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:23,440
machine was affected by a ransomware

2842
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:28,960
if the machine is infected by ransomware

2843
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,880
then you'll need the tool which can be

2844
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,800
used to memory dom

2845
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,320
uh belkasoft has a good tool for memory

2846
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:41,840
acquisition uh magnet forensics also by

2847
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,599
the way these are free tools

2848
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,119
uh belkasoft has one magnet

2849
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:50,480
also has one ftk imager could be also be

2850
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:50,960
used

2851
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,800
it's probably a little bit tricky

2852
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
because it might not support

2853
01:55:54,800 --> 01:56:00,000
all of them uh i know the

2854
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,679
uh i i forgot the name of the tool but

2855
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,360
the the company is called the

2856
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:08,400
comain i know they are rebranding their

2857
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,400
work or something like that that's

2858
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,960
i think they took their tool offline and

2859
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,400
they are planning on

2860
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,360
reintroducing it it's one of the great

2861
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,440
tools it's a command line

2862
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,920
it's a command line tool the good thing

2863
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,679
by the way about

2864
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,800
i forgot the name i will add that to uh

2865
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,440
to the document the good thing about

2866
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:29,920
that

2867
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,199
and the magnet forensics tool

2868
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:36,480
uh is they have no gui so

2869
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,760
the amount of i would say

2870
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,840
the amount of changes that they make to

2871
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,679
your system is very

2872
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,199
minimal so that way not like ftk because

2873
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:47,840
it's a

2874
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,920
it's a gui tool so that way it will do

2875
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,760
some modifications to your memory so

2876
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,520
it's better to use some

2877
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,880
tool that will kind of do

2878
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,679
less modifications to your memory as

2879
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,960
possible

2880
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,840
we are checking the questions that we

2881
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:14,320
have

2882
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,119
the question is talking about the food

2883
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:18,719
yes the company name is it's

2884
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:22,159
uh or the c-o-m-a-e is it the one this

2885
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:25,199
is the one you have mentioned

2886
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,000
what is it again

2887
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,199
i don't know

2888
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,880
i don't remember if that's

2889
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:41,040
but i i will add those by the way to the

2890
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,599
document as well

2891
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,520
maybe after the session that you will

2892
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,119
mention all tools that

2893
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:50,480
have been used in this session

2894
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,280
sure i'll definitely do that uh they're

2895
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,719
asking if you're referring to

2896
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:58,000
dammit dump it yeah

2897
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,719
i think dump it they are now rebranding

2898
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:01,280
it to

2899
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,679
uh yep dump it i don't know how i forgot

2900
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:04,880
that name actually it's

2901
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,000
it's very obvious dump it is the tool

2902
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,239
but i think they took it offline

2903
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:12,719
now so you won't find it unless you have

2904
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,560
an old copy

2905
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,960
i do recall they are playing on

2906
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,040
rebranding or something like that

2907
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,159
so in the meantime i would say uh use

2908
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:25,280
the magnet one or belkasoft or worst

2909
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,639
case use

2910
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:32,239
uh ftk imager but that's a little bit

2911
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:34,800
tricky

2912
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,760
any other questions

2913
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:42,080
uh yeah checking actually

2914
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:47,280
uh amy suggested that we

2915
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,920
extract all files of another cursor file

2916
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,280
hashing

2917
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,159
for the files and compare them i think

2918
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,599
that came up when you

2919
01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:03,840
were talking about 101 tool

2920
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:14,080
yeah 15 10 minutes ago that we extract

2921
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,199
all files and run

2922
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:17,679
a recursive file hashing for the files

2923
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,840
and then compare them

2924
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:23,199
yeah i will add the uh you can uh

2925
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:25,840
either have a tool which does the

2926
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,760
computations those for you all

2927
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,679
or by the way microsoft since you are

2928
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:31,119
using windows

2929
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:34,239
microsoft you can you can just use the

2930
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:36,719
powershell to do that they are on my

2931
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,199
github by the way i try to track these

2932
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,520
down because i'm not good at memorizing

2933
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,239
things and

2934
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:45,520
at the end i do not i would say it's

2935
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,119
hard to memorize a lot of things

2936
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:49,440
so don't try to memorize things but keep

2937
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,599
them in a document somewhere

2938
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:54,159
you can find them on my github uh the

2939
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:55,679
powershell

2940
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:58,320
commands that you can you can use they

2941
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,080
are all listed over there not just by

2942
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,119
the way for

2943
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:04,320
hashes you'll find there also for

2944
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,119
uh timestamps how to modify timestamps

2945
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:08,560
with a local

2946
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,679
utc i'll also be adding the things we

2947
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:13,040
use today

2948
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,920
you'll find all of them

2949
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:20,719
yeah ahmed is asking about automating

2950
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:21,920
evidence collection

2951
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,679
is there any specific tool we can use

2952
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:26,159
for that

2953
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,480
evidence collection yeah to automate the

2954
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,560
evidence collection process

2955
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:33,119
i i would say use keep keep is great by

2956
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:34,000
the way

2957
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,880
uh it can be scripted and automated to

2958
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,480
do all of that for you

2959
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,199
so you can just do some configurations

2960
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:41,599
and

2961
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:45,520
uh i know uh i think uh adam or

2962
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,960
even eric i think he has a a workshop

2963
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,199
uh or andrew i think his name is andrew

2964
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:52,880
sorry about all of those guys

2965
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:56,239
that i forgot their names there are

2966
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:57,360
workshops by the way

2967
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:00,400
they are very detailed how to script the

2968
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:04,080
this and even how to create your own

2969
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:07,599
custom i would say

2970
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:10,320
evidence bag so it will then pass that

2971
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,760
bag of evidence

2972
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,920
uh for you there are workshops i will

2973
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,760
add them to the document

2974
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,400
and this is gonna be a huge list of

2975
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,440
differences

2976
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:22,879
i hope someone at the end

2977
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,679
there is another question just wrapping

2978
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:28,800
up the questions

2979
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,080
um do you have a specific

2980
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:36,239
tool uh no this is the one we we asked

2981
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:38,320
uh do you recommend using autopsy on

2982
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,800
forensics

2983
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,679
autopsy is great by the way and i know

2984
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:44,080
the

2985
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,280
the team behind it they if you if you go

2986
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,119
attend or is the f con

2987
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:52,000
which is the the confidence that the

2988
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,880
company behind the topsy

2989
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,000
holds every year they hold the

2990
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,280
autopsy plug-in competition and

2991
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:05,599
every year new plugins get submitted

2992
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,719
new ideas get uh get added to the tool

2993
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:09,679
so

2994
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,159
if i compare autopsy when i first

2995
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:13,199
started the

2996
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:16,159
using it maybe

2997
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,320
seven years ago or more than that

2998
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:19,920
probably uh to

2999
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,400
where it stands today there's a huge

3000
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,159
there's a huge difference between them

3001
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:26,320
they do you'll see there's a there's a

3002
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:28,719
huge and it's being enhanced every every

3003
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:29,199
year

3004
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:31,520
so keep an eye out for autopsy their

3005
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,080
updates and also the uh

3006
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,560
the plug-in competition some of the the

3007
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,520
plug-ins do not get pushed into the

3008
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,840
autopsy itself but you can go download

3009
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:44,080
them those are

3010
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:46,639
i would say community supported plugins

3011
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:47,360
you can

3012
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,599
go download them and add them to autopsy

3013
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:51,599
and use them yeah autopsy is great by

3014
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:52,080
the way

3015
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,719
just because it's free it doesn't mean

3016
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,560
it's not a good tool

3017
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,679
i personally in at the college i would

3018
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:00,159
say

3019
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:04,400
i mostly in most of my classes

3020
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,440
except for uh the introductory classes

3021
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,080
which is

3022
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,440
what we call the for 101 classes

3023
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:15,199
forensics 101 or 100 level classes

3024
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:19,280
i will show the students how to use

3025
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:23,760
a toolkit like autopsy or axiom

3026
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,960
x-rays etc but after that

3027
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,360
i do not recommend i don't i don't use

3028
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,440
that i always use

3029
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:34,320
a tool for a specific artifact so i

3030
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,280
would mostly use

3031
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:40,239
eric's tools to get uh jump lists to get

3032
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:43,360
like i like lnk files prefetch files one

3033
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:46,400
artifact at the time and show the

3034
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,840
student how

3035
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,480
uh to just look at that single artifact

3036
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,639
then if you have a if you work for

3037
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:55,199
an organization which can pull all those

3038
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:56,800
and to want to look it and you want to

3039
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,320
use that

3040
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:59,920
as long as you know what you're doing

3041
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:03,520
you should be fine with doing that

3042
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,119
second the question it was also about

3043
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:08,719
open source tool and how people can

3044
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:09,599
start

3045
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:12,719
so that's good um

3046
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:17,040
we only have uh yes

3047
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,159
yes and it's a bit detailed um it is why

3048
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:20,800
ahmed

3049
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:24,000
on autopsy if it has a problem with the

3050
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,320
multi-core systems did you find any

3051
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,400
issue when using autopsy

3052
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,880
while using multi-core system at it does

3053
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,599
not use all the cores available

3054
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,360
very specifically any question from

3055
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,639
ahmed uh

3056
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,360
i didn't i didn't notice that honestly

3057
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,880
if i

3058
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,679
i didn't notice that if it's using uh

3059
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:45,920
multi-cores properly or not i didn't

3060
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,400
check that

3061
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,760
okay one quick question how do you

3062
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,320
prevent the usb that contains the dom

3063
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,880
from getting encrypted by the ransomware

3064
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,800
while doing live rom acquisition

3065
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,639
how do i prevent the usb yeah from

3066
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:06,960
getting

3067
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,920
there is also a right blocker for usps

3068
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:22,239
so

3069
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:25,199
probably you can use that uh in those

3070
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:26,320
cases

3071
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,560
uh i'm not sure if this will answer that

3072
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,239
question or not but

3073
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:32,000
again this is not a promotion for a

3074
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,679
company but i

3075
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:38,000
recently uh start using

3076
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,239
bardinix this tool so probably you can

3077
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:42,560
do that i know it's for acquiring

3078
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,239
uh usps i'm not sure if that's

3079
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:47,840
what the answer that's the answer you

3080
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,360
are looking into

3081
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:54,000
or maybe try to like uh

3082
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:57,520
acquire the as long as you have a light

3083
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,079
blocker or as long as your usb

3084
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:02,800
can have like there are some usbs where

3085
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:03,599
you can

3086
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:07,280
make them read only uh that way

3087
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,960
the ransomware will not be able to let's

3088
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,920
say encrypted the data and probably then

3089
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,760
send your data or dump your data

3090
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,599
remotely to some location

3091
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:19,520
or acquire the the data remotely you can

3092
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,639
probably do that

3093
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:23,360
some there are lots of i would say today

3094
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:23,760
uh

3095
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,760
tools which allow you to do remote

3096
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:28,320
acquisition so you don't really need to

3097
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:33,280
plug in a usb and actually do that

3098
02:06:35,199 --> 02:06:38,320
a question about this one system

3099
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:42,840
i think yeah maybe we can

3100
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,840
convert

3101
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,840
he's tired now

3102
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:07,760
this is really appreciated by community
