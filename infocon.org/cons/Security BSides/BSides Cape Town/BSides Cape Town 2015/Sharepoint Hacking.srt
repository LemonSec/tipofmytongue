1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:14,230
join us for the last session of the day
and we talked a little bit touchy point

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:21,030
most of the author and media with once
the appointees my large companies the

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:28,850
same point very very communist rule very
easy to set up its notoriously difficult

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,180
to contact you directly very complex and
it has a whole bunch of functionality to

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,090
do so alone can go wrong when I love you
go wrong with talking about things like

6
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:54,480
closer to document which is really what
you want about who I am on current deals

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:04,048
for company calls since both Pretoria be
doing it for three years now I think any

8
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,710
questions about sports and or something
you don't like about it

9
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:18,309
firing you gonna go into too much detail
of what she went to use just because the

10
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:27,360
fact that most of you guys have used it
at some points in 2001

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
latest version is 2013 sides come
through quite a few generations of the

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,229
box office going to be really seen you
want for 2016 next couple of months but

13
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,520
on the internet the majority what you
see is points 2010 so what I did was a

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,798
basic human needs and make mine shape
twenty students on AWS Amazon and stuff

15
00:01:51,799 --> 00:02:01,860
and I'm going to be doing it's basically
been smiling since breaking the law when

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,369
you get up I think about my setup in
about 15 minutes reading minimal

17
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,949
interaction

18
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:19,290
can be implemented without story of high
to low and basically it's really

19
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,760
difficult 16 to make sure that you lost
on missions and that's something that

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,149
really can be coming back to lots in the
beginning was making mainly used to

21
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,870
internal environments

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,950
being black jeans and document
management personal power flow

23
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,609
management business intelligence and
more recently the whole web content

24
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,950
management

25
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:57,569
inside a whole bunch of the focus on
just one from my perspective and then

26
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,530
it's probably the web content management
class city previously it was made you

27
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,799
gentlemen

28
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,620
conjul management's thought see
organizations which all using ship went

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:16,620
to host their corporate leaders thought
so much of previous just going to text

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,760
although very inexperienced expose it to
the incidence

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,858
miss configurations and that something
is going wrong

32
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:36,300
missions that's going to be licensed
next and gonna be free game

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:44,370
structure she points it's sort of like
hierarchical structure is rushing back

34
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,520
to ESCO you've got money thing inside
another so on and so forth

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,770
one of the top you've got something
that's one of the renowned for all

36
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,880
things generally companies illogic
companies have a whole bunch of some of

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,230
the things that might be managing things
like footballs

38
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:13,420
Hibs international internet with you
might have a whole bunch of science of

39
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,149
like a website but it doesn't actually
media websites what you bring to you

40
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:24,929
it's more like a box or container to
contain little bits and pieces and

41
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,740
actually might need to work so for
example you might have a blog and have

42
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:41,860
one group that's a decent side look to
it and invite the bottom line cool web

43
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,500
pages like your HTML pages or UAE speaks
basis with things like this kind of

44
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,270
thoughts on as soon as you excel sheet
rose and condoms in a bunch of areas

45
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,240
inside and in my home you've got like
these which are very similar list

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,890
accepting that instead of just having
been used but things like fun so we took

47
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:14,840
some pictures and things that are most
interesting to have because that's where

48
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,429
all the sensitive information if that's
what you want to find

49
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:38,460
widespread because his home village see
microsoft said something like two or

50
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,520
three large organizations

51
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:48,260
points which I can't think that's what
makes it so on this page but a whole

52
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,360
bunch of different points is 500
companies yet I looked up when they

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,500
mention us overusing shape once you much
should recognize those names on the left

54
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,870
hand side we've got an example of what I
miss conflagration marketplace so

55
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,230
instead of being presented with the
company's corporate sites you get access

56
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:15,220
to the same points back in and this is
purely because of exposures of suits and

57
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,270
just like that so this is a major player
in the back they're going to be home

58
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:30,510
today didn't go any further than that
because I don't want to we present

59
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:38,710
audience but it's very easy to find a
whole bunch of these sites that have

60
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,650
beset up incorrectly

61
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:55,010
why do you choose to use it could be
because many companies operating

62
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,590
partnership and getting like she pointed
nice hehe

63
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:14,770
document collaboration system something
like that and she went and he acted

64
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,169
directly there might be completely
dependent on Microsoft's so many points

65
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:29,030
was it will go in with you get over
myself around for a long time

66
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,580
going away so either Microsoft because
that's what they know that's what

67
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:43,710
they're comfortable with longtime
collaboration platforms people like to

68
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,650
stick to what they know and also the
fact that my son had a really great

69
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,330
sales machine may be a great job of
making sales and advertising so a lot of

70
00:07:55,330 --> 00:09:04,950
what you see

71
00:09:04,950 --> 00:15:11,880
and it's really easy

72
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:43,870
incidents

73
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,930
quite useful you trying to be a lot of
factors could really what you're doing

74
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,189
so you know things you just trying to
show him and show him the presenting you

75
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,870
with what

76
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:35,660
well then you are sure it's not like
it's just that sometimes is this whole

77
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:45,469
fiasco there is a general aleksandr he
says the leak was disgusted with the

78
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,910
bases actually make sure that the right
information on the same winces anyone

79
00:16:50,910 --> 00:17:14,399
know what this is but it's not cheap
with false made you provide you with

80
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:32,860
security mechanisms to make sure that
things like this don't happen to us you

81
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,360
can have the fence yes you can have
titanium

82
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:52,899
front doors only get a lot of factors
but if you back door is open

83
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,260
becoming more common way of content
management system and a lot of companies

84
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:08,620
posting their web pages on the phone
with caissons so we look at the most

85
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,479
people involved if you look at all the
general feeling that you look in normal

86
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,690
implications injections

87
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,210
wats good things come on injection
possibly causing the bus to prove he is

88
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:29,120
quite interesting is she went context
because she was texting directory your

89
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,639
company's Active Directory

90
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,350
you manage to brute force and it if you
could be going to use that is to gain

91
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:48,469
access to lots of companies for example
they might have my own place and

92
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,000
somebody credentials you could
potentially get into people's boxers

93
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:08,190
set up a rule

94
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,840
the you can get it today

95
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:24,779
things like that

96
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:33,590
the commenting that investigation and
coming back and ABS CBN communicates

97
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:41,158
with a database on the back and my son
ridiculous but a lot of times VCD

98
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,620
databases Microsoft databases

99
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:50,928
because the internet and they raised and
presentable the standard documents on a

100
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:58,080
shape when you might be impossible to
explain which means that they probably

101
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,158
didn't care I changed the default
possibility that they could possibly

102
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,570
love me with something like this say
it's a it's a bank and shit you don't

103
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,779
have those rights equal injection or
cologne injection you can just copy the

104
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:22,399
database and right straight off she
points which is quite cool to me that

105
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:41,270
you're going to see his mission to slice
when you find information disclosure you

106
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:48,799
gonna grab the documents and that's what
you're off the whole bunch of people

107
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:59,539
used to start one of them that's why
he's cool he's been this page and change

108
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,129
this whole time

109
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:09,420
seen playing some sort of external
structure by default is going to have a

110
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,590
generic she points so but if companies
using a custom web applications that

111
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,570
they can have custom services as well

112
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,379
you going to use the database without
having you want these cases of Education

113
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:34,160
no one is quite useless users did so
many demonstrators but later and then

114
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,680
allows us to do you use it he said he
gave you see points and she don't mean

115
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,420
that's uploaded by somebody who is
containable happening

116
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:51,440
uploaded by middle name and you click on
that link to your profile will contain

117
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,480
information and wants to buy rings are
using the telephone number email address

118
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,940
all these bits and pieces of you can you
possibly bring more social engineering

119
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:13,050
attacks in the last few this which is
why not show it to people 61 thats

120
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,990
lockheed on all of them and stuff so
that's something that you might wanna

121
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,180
check out late said she had she went
running and isolation and see what you

122
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,340
can find

123
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:38,830
actually really stupid exercise with a
couple of months ago and before I

124
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,949
started this means the guy hits me we
need to have a chance

125
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:53,700
months ago we act and easy to change
make sure that can happen again

126
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,230
arounds

127
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:03,700
and I try finding the URL one of the
pages and basically what that is

128
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:10,419
puts the pages edit my and it's an
honest anonymously and paid on a website

129
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,030
and so there is a problem

130
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:24,580
yeah it's really actually have led many
are LTV Steel page that you find and

131
00:23:24,580 --> 00:25:28,509
possibly get my which has gone husbands
isolated

132
00:25:28,509 --> 00:26:59,739
I really like 40 went out and they do
the basics very well so it was quite

133
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:07,719
well that's going to be a whole bunch of
extra bits and pieces back I really

134
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:15,619
needed to do that I'll be honest with
you cannot even actually tried it's just

135
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:27,570
kind of baseball game which comes with
gas

136
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:35,540
I tried and tried and tried but I cannot
get that was really a great day

137
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:46,159
confusing enough you should do it that's
not for me

138
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:57,400
risking that it does she is a printing
what do you call you more about it all

139
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:08,900
better exactly twice because the kitchen
sink at an old friend she's a lot of

140
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:20,150
when to expect during a cold front page
techniques against USC 2013 I'll be

141
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,810
going quick so we do this whole thing of
printing process so we can get it I

142
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:33,110
wonder if you get bigger picture of Mary
couple of blocks and is doing so it

143
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:39,060
looks at response headers from the site
and extracting information not being

144
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:45,320
tells you what she appoints versions
that enables and it tells you exactly

145
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:54,300
what you think will be high and then
something that came from
