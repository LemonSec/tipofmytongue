23
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,480
give you an idea of today and then I'll

24
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,020
hand over to intersect to take it from

25
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,940
there

26
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,360

all been instrumental as well as hack

32
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,340
the box and making today happen it's a

33
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,580
community run thing we've done a meeting

34
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
every week for the whole year to pull

35
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,179
this off we had a bit of a

36
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,760
falter in covert and we've always liked

37
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,780
doing this live so we really didn't just

38
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,059
feel that in cover doing more online

39
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,419
stuff was going to work for us so yeah

40
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,539
especially to intersect

41
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,820
making this venue happen and for all the

42
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,340
swag and just everyone who was involved

43
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,539
and made it an absolute Joy this year

44
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,100
and yeah we tried to mix it up a bit

45
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,940
with the venue and doing a CTF and

46
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,260
workshops

47
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,380
so if you want to get involved in the

48
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,720
CTF we all have some prizes we'll check

49
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,480
at the end of the day it already started

50
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,600
at seven

51
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,280
which technically actually is nine you

52
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,200
know sorry seven UTC so it started five

53
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,179
minutes ago we have some purple team

54
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,720

away and also thanks to V who a lot of

57
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,039
you might know she actually also sent us

58
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,220
prizes from the north

59
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,760
um there is a Discord as well where you

60
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,740
can ask for support but for the most

61
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,500
part you just go to this link if you

62
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,179
want to do the

63
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,460
um CTF so we also have two workshops so

64
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,740
one starting at 11.

65
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,340
um

66
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,100
and another one starting at one both of

67
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,900
those will be in the area where you did

68
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
your registration there's a boardroom

69
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,600
there

70
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,820
that's just where you go it's super

71
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,039
simple so you'll see there's a lot of

72
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,620
smaller rooms at the lower floors if you

73
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,179
feel like doing CTF if you get

74
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,919
overwhelmed if you just want to chill

75
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,400
you can go sit there there's chairs or

76
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,799
fat sacks or whatever

77
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,520
um and yeah first floors food and coffee

78
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,779
um we'll have coffee again at 11 and 2

79
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,779
30 and then lunch

80
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,900
check the schedule because I just forgot

81
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,059
but I think it's between 12 and 1 and

82
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,360
then obviously track two and workshops

83
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,100
are one floor down and you're in track

84
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,140
one right now

85
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,880
um and then the last thing I'll say is

86
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,900
have fun and treat everyone with respect

87
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,600

88
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,399
that things go smoothly thanks

89
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,760
and thanks for being here

90
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,699
[Music]

91
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
just me

92
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,500
hi everyone

93
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,260
um I'm Richard I head up engineering at

94
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,539
intersect and we're really really happy

95
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,480
to have spent a lot of money sponsoring

96
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,179
this event today

97
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,360
and and really really pleased that we

98
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,620
can get everyone together in person

99
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,699
again so um

100
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,140
one of the reasons we're delighted to be

101
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,559
a sponsor is much like me

102
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,299
three or four years ago you might wonder

103
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,179
who is intersecting what do we do I mean

104
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,620
that's been a challenge for us for a

105
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,500
while because um we've um we've been in

106
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,779
business since 2010 headquartered in

107
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,779
Stellenbosch but our our product is one

108
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,240
that's very much under the hood it's a

109
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,919
little bit like information security you

110
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,900
don't see much of it happening

111
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,760
and so we build software products that

112
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,400
help Banks and financial institutions to

113
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,100
to secure transactions

114
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
um and and actually in South Africa we

115
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,179
secure most of the banking transactions

116
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,419
that happen over the mobile and the web

117
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,580
and I thought to anyone even knowing it

118
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,080
so

119
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,700
we thought that this would be an

120
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,980
occasion to spread the love a little bit

121
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,320
and and help more and more people get to

122
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,720
understand who intersect is what do we

123
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,240
do and maybe get to know some of the

124
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,940
fantastic and sick people that um have

125
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,740
written in on the company coattails

126
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,140
um our software is not consumer facing

127
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,179
we'll see from some of the stats here

128
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,700
that we

129
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,799
okayed millions and millions of

130
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,020
transactions around the globe over 100

131
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,299
Banks and financial institutions use our

132
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,100
product

133
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,620
and we recently took funding from one of

134
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,140
the big private Equity firms in the U.S

135
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,159
Axel KKR the idea was not uh to find

136
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,100
some more b-sides but to help us to help

137
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,440
us to grow into North America where

138
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
probably most of United banking

139
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,460
infrastructure and payment system is not

140
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,700
up to our European and African

141
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,520
so that's really exciting for a for a

142
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,980
small startup or

143
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,020
Growth Company out of Stellenbosch we're

144
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,419
really part of about that

145
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:37,020
um

146
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,740
so our challenge as I said is that not

147
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,600
many people know who we are

148
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
and so we invited a few of our our great

149
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,860
people here today so that you can meet

150
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,760
them

151
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,580
and get to know someone from intersect

152
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,899
hopefully

153
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,760
you'll get to know a little bit more

154
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,500
about what we do

155
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,799
so our tagline is intersect and you're

156
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,640
in

157
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,159
so if you work with us in Stellenbosch

158
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
you definitely are in The In Crowd and

159
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,720
but the tagline is really about how we

160
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,779
allow banking customers to enable their

161
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,600
clients to get into the bank or to get

162
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
into the e-commerce payment without a

163
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,779
lot of friction

164
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:19,980
and so you should hear a lot about

165
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,140
intersect if you're interested and you

166
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,740
follow us about slick user experiences

167
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,100
security can be a hindrance it can it

168
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,740
can be a blockage to to create payments

169
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,460
and so our our mission is to make those

170
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,880
secure secure transactions slick with a

171
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,919
great user experience

172
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,740
so our tagline intersection you're in

173
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,539
does apply to what we do for our banks

174
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,720
it applies to our people as well and we

175
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,779
think that um if if you can get to meet

176
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,840
one or two intersect people today it may

177
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,760

if it's going to give that feedback

192
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,640
that's perfect

193
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,340
okay good morning folks

194
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,340
um the really wordy title uh we'll get

195
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,080
to in a little bit

196
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,120
um for the most part

197
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,399
um I want to start by saying uh thanks

198
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,799
and sorry

199
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,299
um and

200
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,299
um thanks mainly because it's early in

201
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,520
the morning and normally

202
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,039
like I try to avoid Keynotes because

203
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,360
they not as meaty and there's an old

204
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,820
person either trying to sell you stuff

205
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,799
or trying to give you advice that's

206
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,320
slightly outdated

207
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,960
um so yeah thanks thanks a lot for

208
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,860
coming

209
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,940
um I've seen lots of talks uh in my time

210
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,159
seeing a few Keynotes and most of them

211
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,820
are pretty routinely were garbage

212
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,140
um

213
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,600
so I'm sitting a low bar someone before

214
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,059
the talk told me this secret to life is

215
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,980
to set a low bar

216
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,980
um yeah so so most Keynotes are

217
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,720
generally garbage and and part of the

218
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,539
reason is uh we're talking about it like

219
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,179
it's a quirk that you start getting

220
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,919
invited for Keynotes when you're old

221
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,500
enough that what you do no longer

222
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,960
matters as much so you kind of make sure

223
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,179
that the person keynoting just doesn't

224
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,919
have the right amount of experience for

225
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,360
you

226
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,580
um but like there's that old sunscreen

227
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,980
song that says giving advice is a form

228
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,980
of nostalgia so the person giving it to

229
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,559
you thinks more of it and it's kind of

230
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,039
all of you to kind of take it so thanks

231
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,919
um and well I want to say sorry because

232
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,620
you'd already have noticed I say

233
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,519
um a lot uh sometimes I repeat myself

234
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,620
um and and the repeating myself mainly I

235
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,600
mean if you've ever watched one of my

236
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,399
other talks or ever heard parts of it

237
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,820
there's some things that I say a lot

238
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,159
um some topics that we talk about a lot

239
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,099
and it's not just because we're lazy

240
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,839
um in part it's because it's the stuff

241
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,119
we believe in and and so that doesn't

242
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,879
change uh too much from day to day and

243
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,300
we end up talking about it uh a fair bit

244
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,280
um the other thing is that I use a lot

245
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,159
of quotes uh in my talk and mainly

246
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,080
that's because I'm lazy

247
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,000
um and quoting other people just means

248
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
that you don't have to actually uh think

249
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,320
for yourself

250
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,219
um

251
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,260
for this keynote the last thing I want

252
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,619
to say sorry for upfront is that some of

253
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,659
it will sting

254
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,940
um and and mainly uh some of it will

255
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,879
sting because in part like that's what

256
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,040
the morning talk is for like other

257
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,140
people will give you actual practical

258
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,260
stuff uh that you can verify I'm gonna

259
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,020
give you hand wavy stuff uh that you

260
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,880
can't hold me to

261
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,280
um but almost every time I've gotten

262
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
useful advice uh from someone it did

263
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,960
sting a little because you wouldn't have

264
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
been doing doing it the wrong way if you

265
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,640
didn't think it was right and and when

266
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,320
somebody uh nudges you uh its things and

267
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,260
and so I guess the first uh quote that

268
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll use or the first URL that I'll

269
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,619
refer to is

270
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,599
if you get one of those things that

271
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,300
sting give it five minutes

272
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,700
um and and this was actually a blog post

273
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,880
that Jason freed from 37 signals had put

274
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,740
out a while back

275
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,180
um and he's got this really interesting

276
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,060
story where he went uh he went to a talk

277
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,980
that someone gave someone said something

278
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,099
that he felt was egregiously wrong and

279
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,280
after the talk he goes during q a and he

280
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,079
immediately pounces on the guy like you

281
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,579
said this and this is why you're wrong

282
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,440
and you didn't think about that

283
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,119
and he says the speaker looked at him

284
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,640
and said man give it five minutes like

285
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,579
like Let It settle and and

286
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,500
he's got this whole post about it that's

287
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,940
that's worth reading but he says look

288
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,740
like the speaker has spent time thinking

289
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,420
about it he spent time putting this

290
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,640
thing together and what he was doing was

291
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,520
instantly reacting to it and instantly

292
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,500
figured out why the guy was wrong and

293
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,780
and sometimes like it's worth just

294
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,060
giving it five minutes uh just to think

295
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,220
about it if nothing else it gives me a

296
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,260
chance to leave the room

297
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,820
um

298
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,339
and I I guess one of the things that

299
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,040
that is a perfectly reasonable question

300
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,619
is well why you should bother listening

301
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:38,700
to me

302
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,000
um there's no very good answer to that

303
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,859
um for the most part I've been really

304
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,320
lucky in my career so I got to play uh

305
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,079
in a bunch of different spaces

306
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,119
um spent a bunch of time with the other

307
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,880
two old guys in front uh hacking on

308
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,140
stuff

309
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,720
um in the early 2000s like we broke into

310
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,220
things all over

311
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,220
I spent a small stunt uh seesawing and

312
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,200
now we've got a company that builds a

313
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,040
security software

314
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,500
the only thing that applies here is

315
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,540
because I've been lucky enough to be a

316
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,780
part of doing research that that played

317
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,300
internationally or Building Products

318
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,359
that sell internationally and and if not

319
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,579
uh just from my experience like I've got

320
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,180
to see people I worked with and and so

321
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,619
you can tell

322
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,960
um or or you get to tell like here's the

323
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,760
sort of person who does work that

324
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,760
becomes first class research or here's

325
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,740
someone who builds a product that that

326
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,660
has legs

327
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,579
um and for the most part that's my early

328
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,260
appeal to Authority that says I've

329
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,820
worked with some of these people and I

330
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,280
can kind of tell the difference and uh

331
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,859
this is what I've noticed

332
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,839
um so what's the talk about you should

333
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,579
be really afraid because we're five

334
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,740
minutes in and I'm just uh getting to

335
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,180
that now

336
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,579
um but that's the point of the keynote

337
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,859
and I'll ramble a little bit

338
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,440
um for the most part I'm going to share

339
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,900
some links so even if my talk is

340
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,940
complete garbage you get some links that

341
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,339
you should take away and read

342
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,820
um and what I want to talk about is why

343
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,079
so few

344
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,140
cyber security products make it from

345
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,180
South Africa into the world so intersect

346
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,280
is one of them and that's cool did my

347
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,800
bit for the sponsors there you go

348
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,520
um

349
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,780
but

350
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,540
um they're still shockingly few of them

351
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,839
and and if you take security research

352
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,760
some of our stuff has made it to the

353
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,579
world stage but not a lot

354
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,619
um and and there's lots of us and cyber

355
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,660
security is not that new in South Africa

356
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,220
like we've got people who've been doing

357
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,920
it for decades now and and the numbers

358
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,619
are still surprisingly low

359
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,920
and and the question is why

360
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,320
um and and I'll start with

361
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,320
um why we don't make great software or

362
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,900
great software companies and and one of

363
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,020
the things that should be obvious is if

364
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,300
you're a student graduating from our

365
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,460
University is today

366
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,440
you in this in the same position as a

367
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,560
student graduating from MIT or Caltech

368
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,020
like we've got the same internet the

369
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,880
same laptops we're building on the same

370
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,060
AWS we've got access to the same open

371
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,619
courseware

372
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,980
but for some reason

373
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,099
people leave MIT and want to start

374
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,640
Google and Facebook and people leave our

375
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,920
universities and want to work at one of

376
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,599
the big audit houses

377
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,260
like like that thing just puts us on a

378
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,200
different trajectory where our best want

379
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,599
to work at a company at best they end up

380
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,980
at a bank doing Java web interfaces

381
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,540
um

382
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,800
and

383
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,579
so part of the question is why and and

384
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,220
the moment you ask this question and and

385
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,020
again I think it's just one of those

386
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,119
things that's empirically true right we

387
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,859
don't have that many software companies

388
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,920
and and there are other products that

389
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,200
need lots of Investments but software

390
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,839
doesn't which is interesting because if

391
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,640
this topic ever comes up one of the

392
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
first things people go to is that South

393
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,500
Africa doesn't have great software

394
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,380
companies because we lack a good VC

395
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,700
ecosystem

396
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,579
and like I've got strong thoughts about

397
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,000
uh venture capital and why most of it is

398
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,320
pretty terrible for the security

399
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,260
industry but even if you if you look uh

400
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,599
historically you'll see lots of great

401
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,440
companies didn't do huge amounts of uh

402
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,740
VC raises like Apple at 3 million

403
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,020
MailChimp raised nothing and they

404
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,140
currently worth billions so so venture

405
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,480
capital on its own is not the reason why

406
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,500
we are or aren't making a great software

407
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,200
and and the answer is almost uh

408
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,900
tautological we don't make software

409
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,599
because we don't make software like it's

410
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,820
just not something we get used to doing

411
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,460
and and what you'll see and I've been

412
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,980
ranting about this for many years is

413
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,740
that in South Africa we end up becoming

414
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,400
a nation of consumers like by default we

415
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
think that software is there for us to

416
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,900
use we use these big companies it's just

417
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,480
not something uh that we put together

418
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,599
and what's worse about it is it's not

419
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,480
just that we end up thinking that we

420
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,060
can't do it we start to think that all

421
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,339
the people around us can't do it

422
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,520
and uh it's it's interesting like like I

423
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,560
know uh intersect and we've worked with

424
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,839
them uh from way back but I can tell you

425
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,400
as a local software company

426
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,900
even at my previous uh at the previous

427
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,940
security company that we had most of our

428
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,700
customers by far were International

429
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,060
when when we built uh things Canary we

430
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,099
didn't sell much of it locally at all we

431
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,500
did no local sales we sold

432
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,200
internationally and then some local

433
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,060
customers happened to come along like

434
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,579
the big Banks and the large financials

435
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,960
and

436
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,619
in part it's because locally people

437
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,800
judge local software differently to how

438
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,680
internationally they judge software one

439
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,980
of the joys of of Silicon Valley is the

440
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,400
way they've embraced failure okay and if

441
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,760
if you take the average like walk down

442
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,040
uh any Street in Silicon Valley and

443
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,000
you'll find

444
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,640
their coffee shop is trying out a new

445
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,920
access control method a new way for

446
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,859
people to try paying for their coffees

447
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,800
and you'll see lots of terrible terrible

448
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,240
products right like if you remember

449
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,460
Twitter and how it sucked in its early

450
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,300
days

451
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,359
and the difference is if something like

452
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,220
that comes out from a South African

453
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,660
company

454
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,660
lots of us will be the first to tear

455
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,520
that product down and talk about how

456
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,060
junk it is okay and the truth is all

457
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,119
software is junk like if if you look at

458
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:09,839
reports of software on early Teslas like

459
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,060
people were literally sshing into

460
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,280
devices and controlling onboard

461
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,560
computers and and when this whole

462
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,480
kerfuffle happened a very famous

463
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,780
security dude uh much who's even older

464
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,760
than the guys in the frontier

465
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,800
um much stood up and said look that's

466
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,500
how software happens like like that's

467
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,680
it's messy and and that's what happens

468
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,240
and in South Africa we kind of lack

469
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,700
compassion for our people building that

470
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,980
kind of software we tear down very

471
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,240
quickly

472
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,160
um and in the end what it means is that

473
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,140
nobody here does it

474
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,819
um instead we just use the international

475
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,079
stuff

476
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,240
and and for this you can get all

477
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,680
biblical

478
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,380
um because that talks about no profit is

479
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,500
uh accepted in his hometown but but it's

480
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,760
a little bit

481
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,740
um more than that

482
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,839
um when it comes to local software

483
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,660
there's a genuine feeling that locals

484
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,240
can't do it and and with all evidence to

485
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,180
the country but but the worst part is it

486
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,760
creates this horrible Loop right where

487
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,520
our best then leave because they can't

488
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,920
build software here and then what you

489
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,540
left with is people who can't build

490
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,880
software and then when they try building

491
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,220
software it's terrible and you get to

492
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,960
say look the software is terrible why

493
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,300
should we pay for that

494
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,819
um and one of the solutions for it is

495
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,119
just that we need to build more stuff we

496
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,099
need to get used to people building more

497
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,119
stuff

498
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,060
um for those of you who remember FTP

499
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,460
um you slightly date yourself but but

500
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,220
everyone who was using FTP for a while

501
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,900
was using wuftp and wuftp was literally

502
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,720
Washington University FTP and and if you

503
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,760
wanted to practice on a memory

504
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,700
corruption bug class you could just do

505
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,280
it on wftp because chances are they made

506
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,400
that mistake but lots of people went to

507
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,140
that University and cut their teeth

508
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,420
building that software and learned how

509
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,260
to actually ship real software and if I

510
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,819
had a software South African

511
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,980
universities have shipped in the last

512
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,359
few years

513
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,099
um I don't know about you but I'd be

514
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,640
hard-pressed to answer anything and and

515
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,740
again with all of the stuff you see

516
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,660
there's the cycle

517
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,000
um you see the universities and

518
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,500
government have a part to play

519
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,619
government needs to

520
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:36,720
give projects like this to fledgling

521
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,359
software companies if if you look

522
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,060
historically you'll see young article

523
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,880
cut its teeth building databases for the

524
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
government like that's how that stuff

525
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,579
happened

526
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,520
but nobody in this room controls that

527
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,800
and and so for the most part I think

528
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,720
what the people in this room need to get

529
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
used to is being less judgmental now I'm

530
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,099
not

531
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,200
so that we can start having sucky

532
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,319
software products I'm saying it so that

533
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,660
we can start having software products

534
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,480
and with iteration software products

535
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,400
that suck today will hopefully suck a

536
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,020
little less and eventually start getting

537
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,920
better

538
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,319
but but if nothing else you should watch

539
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,720
it at the Tui just for Anton ego's

540
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,040
speech

541
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,220
um the the new needs friends

542
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,420
um unless you're dealing with

543
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,280
cryptocurrencies in which case they need

544
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,680
no friends uh and it should all be burnt

545
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,020
to the ground

546
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,740
um so so that's my bit on uh building

547
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,040
products and and now I want to talk

548
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,099
about software security research

549
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,680
and it's probably gonna sting slightly

550
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,020
more um for everyone in this room um

551
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,819
just for the show of hands how many of

552
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,680
you here identify as security

553
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,240
researchers

554
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,720
whether it's part-time or something you

555
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,319
want to do

556
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,960
you shall raise a sense okay there's a

557
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,579
few so so there's an interesting

558
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,740
question here um that I mentioned at the

559
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,720
beginning which is just Why South

560
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,280
Africa's software uh why our research

561
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,000
output is so small and and you could say

562
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,440
that we are small country that's

563
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,880
isolated but but if you look

564
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,140
historically

565
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,420
you'll see other small countries you'll

566
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,240
see great stuff from Argentina

567
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,339
like like the argentinians have been

568
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,260
doing memory corruption exploits that

569
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,119
have surprised the world since the early

570
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,680
2000s

571
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,780
um if you look at Poland they had like

572
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,200
the LSD team they had Joiner at kowska

573
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,140
they heavily represented uh in the world

574
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,240
you look at the Australians you look at

575
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,660
the kiwis like lots of small places have

576
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,180
produced lots of great security research

577
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,859
on the world stage

578
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:53,400
but South Africa hasn't and and the

579
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,460
question that we have to ask is why like

580
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,599
why don't we and and like you don't end

581
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,440
up with too many answers other than us

582
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,500
like like for for other things

583
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,020
you can blame ecosystems and you can

584
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,480
blame lots of stuff but but for security

585
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,960
research stuff at this point it's just

586
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,920
us

587
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,680
there's no great limitations that stop

588
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,859
us like we're not doing it because we're

589
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,119
not doing it

590
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,140
and again because the topic becomes uh

591
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,780
harsh to read I'm mostly going to cheat

592
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,500
and uh refer to this paper that that

593
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,300
I've often quoted

594
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,420
if any of you have not read uh Richard

595
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,180
Hemmings you and your research

596
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,180
like it's awesome uh I wish I was you

597
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,560
because like reading it for the first

598
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,220
time it's mind-blowing and and it's so

599
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,440
good that you should periodically read

600
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,000
it again uh when whenever you can and in

601
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,040
in this it was actually a talk Richard

602
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,079
Hamming gave to a bunch of scientists

603
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,240
and and he was talking to them about

604
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,280
what makes the difference between

605
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,339
scientists who do great work he calls it

606
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,260
first class work and scientists who

607
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,099
don't

608
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,060
and and the paper is amazingly good like

609
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,980
he goes through a whole bunch of things

610
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,900
uh motivation work life balance How to

611
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,960
Succeed after you've become a success so

612
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,480
it's totally worth it if if

613
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,599
nothing else comes out of this talk

614
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,000
um you should go read this paper and

615
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,579
it'll still be totally worth it and and

616
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,079
one of the things that is that that

617
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,140
Hamming starts with in the paper is he

618
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,420
says look you've got to start by by

619
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,520
admitting to yourself that you want to

620
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,099
do great work that that you want to do

621
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:50,040
first class research and this was

622
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,440
already in the 80s but but he talks

623
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,640
about how already people kind shy away

624
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,920
from saying they want to do that like

625
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,780
people are slightly embarrassed to say

626
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,540
you know actually I want to present that

627
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,079
black hat and there's no reason to be

628
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,660
ashamed of it right like like a few

629
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,420
years ago uh I worked with uh Dominic

630
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,040
from sense post

631
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,040
and and very early on we were talking

632
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,440
about he was slightly embarrassed to say

633
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,280
like

634
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,640
he enjoyed the rush he gets talking at a

635
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,440
at a public conference

636
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,420
and that's nothing to be embarrassed by

637
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,640
like people like being recognized by

638
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,800
their peers and one of the things is

639
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,540
just to admit that that's what you want

640
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,760
and then you work for that thing like

641
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,500
like there's nothing wrong with wanting

642
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,720
really smart people to think that you're

643
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,560
smart

644
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,800
wanting to speak at black cat is is cool

645
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,380
like it's it's changed lots of the

646
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,119
trajectory of lots of people's careers

647
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,720
and as a point just saying yep I want to

648
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,500
do this stuff uh is is important

649
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,220
um but then Hamming gets like again in

650
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,680
the first few paragraphs uh to a really

651
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,319
tricky thing where he turns around and

652
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,380
says how did I do this study like like

653
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,680
what made me do the study about what

654
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,220
makes great scientists and and for him

655
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,200
he worked on the Manhattan Project and

656
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,300
he talks about how he's there with uh

657
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,240
Hans bet with Fermi with Feynman

658
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,640
and he says I was there to fix computers

659
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,359
and I saw that I was a stooge and of

660
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,819
course his uh being self-deprecating

661
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,440
like he's invited to work on the

662
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,819
Manhattan Project

663
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,099
but but it is it is interesting because

664
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,020
almost

665
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,720
comes out of his paper comes from this

666
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,859
uh

667
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,980
from this uh sort of self-awareness

668
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,160
that says there is great stuff happening

669
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,040
there are people doing this amazing work

670
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,780
but I'm not

671
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,300
and

672
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,339
for one of those particularly stinging

673
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,880
uh things uh I'll tell you that

674
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,220
in my experience

675
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,880
South Africans have uh we have a super

676
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,300
unusual trait like we joke about it

677
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,240
sometimes uh with with some of the other

678
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,119
researchers that I know but if if you

679
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,000
talk to the average South African

680
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,280
I.T manager

681
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,380
they have really good advice for you on

682
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,079
how Steve Jobs should have run apple or

683
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,859
how Elon Musk should run Twitter and and

684
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:31,020
deep in his bones or her bones he's

685
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,940
convinced that that's the way that

686
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,900
should go

687
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,640
and and you

688
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,540
for research where you talk to lots of

689
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,839
published research internationally

690
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,599
but are super convinced the only reason

691
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,940
they haven't is because they just didn't

692
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,980
get around to it yet

693
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,579
and and

694
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,680
from from taking stock and going no

695
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,380
actually I want to do that thing

696
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,319
that thing is really hard to do I'm

697
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,180
going to put in the work to do that

698
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,240
thing instead it lives in this kind of

699
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,400
vacuous space that goes like yeah I

700
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,140
could do that if I had the time or I

701
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,880
could do that if my organization was

702
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,260
different

703
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,720
um and and in a way this lack of

704
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,000
self-awareness is is almost the opposite

705
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
of of what you see in the in the Hamming

706
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,000
case and and again it's this question

707
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,160
that says how do you rank your output or

708
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,140
how do you rank your research is

709
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,180
something that that modern culture kind

710
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,160
of frowns upon you're not supposed to be

711
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,720
that competitive you're not supposed to

712
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,059
uh to look at yourself that way but

713
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,680
Heming makes it clear that if you want

714
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,020
to do first class work

715
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,579
it's kind of what you have to do

716
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,920
they do it like what are the trade-offs

717
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,980
they making uh in their life and and

718
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,839
again it's something that it's really

719
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,660
easy to fool yourself with okay it's one

720
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,059
of those things that every part of your

721
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,420
mind wants to convince you that actually

722
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,819
you are hell of a flick you just didn't

723
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:06,660
do maths uh in matric and if only you

724
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,579
did maths instead of doing what you did

725
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,819
you'd be hellva too okay but but for

726
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,980
anyone who's worked with hellval knows

727
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,020
however they know that he's been

728
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,200
totally dedicated to his craft for 20

729
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,260
years and and the reason he's hell-wise

730
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,780
because of that and the reason I'm not

731
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,280
is because I'm not

732
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,339
um so hemming starts and goes okay uh

733
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,200
you've got to do this and and then he

734
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,559
talks about luck um so so in this topic

735
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:39,480
of of

736
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,839
how much does Luck play a part in in

737
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:45,359
whether you do great work or not and and

738
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,920
I'll come back to this in a little bit

739
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,700
but to this question that says if you

740
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,859
deep down believe that you are quality

741
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,119
researcher

742
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,800
one of the questions you should be

743
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,140
asking yourself is just why you haven't

744
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,780
published good research yet

745
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,559
and again like you always have really

746
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,020
good reasons for it okay there's there's

747
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,420
always stuff and and inside you know you

748
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,420
capable of it but you just haven't and

749
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,880
again it ties in to the earlier topic

750
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,520
that says we start getting really

751
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,460
comfortable just consuming security

752
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,559
research

753
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,680
um a few years ago more than a few years

754
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,540
ago now because we old

755
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,280
um we we started uh Zed Khan uh in

756
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,000
gauteng and we had this huge uh fight

757
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,339
slash discussion on whether we should do

758
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:41,880
badge hacking or any of the other

759
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,160
conference entertainment stuff that

760
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,740
happens around security conferences

761
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,099
and I was totally against it and and I

762
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,960
was horribly overruled and I still think

763
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,000
I was right but

764
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,880
for the most part you see even security

765
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,240
conferences today very quickly Veer down

766
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,780
towards containment you go to the

767
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,440
conference you do add some LEDs to a

768
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,380
badge you learn how to become a DJ you

769
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,619
do stuff like that okay and I didn't

770
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,780
want it for zacon because I felt it was

771
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,880
disrespectful to the speakers like

772
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,920
somebody worked months to put a talk

773
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,800
together and instead of listening to the

774
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,960
speaker you're now sitting there uh

775
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,660
trying to put LEDs on and I by the

776
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,000
argument that that for some people it

777
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,160
introduces them to electronics

778
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,740
but but you start to see almost

779
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,920
everything push us towards pure

780
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,800
consumerism and and even conferences

781
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,680
become like that where

782
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,599
it's actually a quick shot of work

783
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,880
people go in they attend it they had a

784
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,760
nice time uh and they go home

785
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,040
and yeah it's it's one of those things

786
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,440
that uh you're just gonna have to change

787
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,079
if you want to do quality research

788
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,619
and whenever people discuss why they

789
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,920
haven't done uh research you'll start to

790
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,079
see people say they didn't have the time

791
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:10,200
they didn't have org support and and for

792
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,780
no time like that's an easy one to kill

793
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,660
right halva doesn't have more hours in

794
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,920
his day

795
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,440
um taviso doesn't have more hours in his

796
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,300
day he's just making different

797
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,200
trade-offs than we are and and again the

798
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,960
simple thing becomes do you want to do

799
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,420
this if you want to do this you need to

800
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,520
understand the trade-offs and then you

801
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,579
make them or you don't and uh if you do

802
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,339
you you get a shot at it

803
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:41,280
um no org support is is a really

804
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,800
interesting one and I warned you that

805
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,020
almost all of this was just a bad

806
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:49,020
Nostalgia but when I was at sense post

807
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,859
uh we met a customer and and it was a

808
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:56,099
few days before we went uh to black hat

809
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,740
and and this customer had a he was a CSO

810
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,000
at a pretty cushy job in in gauteng

811
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,980
and I remember specifically he said

812
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,540
something like oh you guys are going to

813
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,059
Black Cat you're so lucky my company

814
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:10,920
doesn't pay like and he was all

815
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,720
insulting like my stupid company doesn't

816
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,460
pay for me to go

817
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,559
and at the time it's really bristled

818
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,660
because like for us to go to black cat

819
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,300
like nobody was magically paying for it

820
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,180
right like we we had our day jobs which

821
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,700
was doing pen tests and then to do that

822
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,280
research we were spending days and

823
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,099
nights to be able to do a talk we

824
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,859
submitted talk it gets accepted and

825
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:37,680
that's why we're going to Black Cat and

826
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,440
he could have done that like like our

827
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,480
org didn't give us any more support than

828
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,359
his org did and at the time his uh

829
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,579
Facebook was filled with weekends where

830
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:51,839
he spent four by four in uh and and like

831
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,119
at the time I felt very strongly like a

832
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,760
thing that said out like my org didn't

833
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,339
allow this to happen I gave up quality

834
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,859
family time to make this happen you can

835
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,240
too

836
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,480
um and and then a better example of this

837
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,240
uh came up if have any of you read the

838
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,160
book Skunk Works

839
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,140
uh so that's something else that's cool

840
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,720
if if you take away there's there's a

841
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,960
book by uh so so firstly if if you work

842
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,000
in an org and they talk about doing

843
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,059
Skunk Works Skunk Works was originally

844
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:27,000
based on an actual Skunk Works division

845
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,660
that Lockheed Martin did and the second

846
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,020
person to run uh Skunk Works a guy

847
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,020
called uh Ben rich

848
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,579
um wrote this book about how they

849
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,520
invented stealth technology and and the

850
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,260
book's fascinating for a whole bunch of

851
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,020
reasons um but but one of the

852
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,119
interesting things for this story was

853
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,180
Ben takes over from this Legend who who

854
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,460
made skunk box and and the guy before

855
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,220
him who made Skunk Works uh had such a

856
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,260
reputation that he'd literally tell the

857
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,339
Air Force

858
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:01,859
I want to build a jet that uses the

859
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,799
stars for navigation give me n million

860
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,440
gets the money makes the jet delivers it

861
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,540
to the Air Force and and he was a

862
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,640
legendary pilot legendary administrator

863
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,760
and he's now going to retire

864
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,980
and so the new guy taking over as to

865
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,020
follow in those footsteps and and that's

866
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,680
near impossible and so the new guy steps

867
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,799
in and he pulls out this old research

868
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,540
paper on stealth technology and they

869
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,040
start putting together what what

870
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,680
eventually becomes the nigh talk uh and

871
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,500
and modern day stealth but but there's a

872
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,140
really interesting thing where they

873
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,299
pulled it they invented it's it's

874
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:41,220
completely impossible at the time right

875
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,319
like with the technology they've they've

876
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,480
shrunk down the radar cross-section of a

877
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,420
jet to the size of a golf ball like

878
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,119
completely unheard of they've presented

879
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,520
it to the Air Force and they now get the

880
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,920
contract to build these things and and

881
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,660
there's a snippet of the book

882
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,339
um I've actually got that snippet up in

883
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,380
that blog post where the US government

884
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,780
is now on top of them when they're

885
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,280
making the stuff

886
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,680
and the governments on top of them in

887
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,200
the sort of way that you expect a

888
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,660
Draconian

889
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,760
kafka-esque bureaucracy it's like they

890
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,980
find them for their workspaces not being

891
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,140
clean enough they find them for using

892
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,940
the wrong materials

893
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,880
and and it's really counter-intuitive

894
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,280
because you kind of think that these

895
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,079
people who are doing Skunk Works

896
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,700
building

897
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,940
Generations ahead aircraft would have

898
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,119
this free hand to do cool stuff

899
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:38,400
but it's actually completely the

900
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,040
opposite they have to fight for every

901
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,680
dime that they get they have to justify

902
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,440
every decision that they get and you

903
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,079
start to realize that if you working at

904
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,359
an org where you think they don't give

905
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,339
you the freedom to innovate

906
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:55,859
they didn't innovate at Skunk Works

907
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,020
because they had a free hand they

908
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,359
innovated that Skunk Works despite the

909
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:02,520
fact that they didn't have a free hand

910
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,240
and if you if you building your stealth

911
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,480
it's probably not because your org is

912
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,700
restricting you it's probably because

913
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,980
you're not been Rich

914
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,160
um and I give this example of taviso um

915
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,680
all of you show of hands anyone doesn't

916
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,200
know taviso

917
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,619
okay so so Tevis is a pretty famous

918
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,500
researcher who works for Google project

919
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,059
zero

920
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,819
if if there's anything that's vulnerable

921
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,799
chances are someone in the world has

922
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,660
exploited it and chances are that

923
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,579
someone is terrible so

924
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:41,880
um but Jokes Aside like early on hacked

925
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,859
the PSP

926
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:47,280
um really a skillful uh code auditor his

927
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,980
his hack on the PSP was actually the

928
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,260
same Hack That Was Then used by people

929
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,400
on the iPhone so so the early iPhone

930
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,740
jailbreaks used uh used his hacks but

931
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,900
one of the the interesting things if you

932
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,660
look at taviso's stuff I'm going to

933
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,599
break my slides to do this but let's see

934
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:09,599
and that totally doesn't work

935
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,579
because who knows how that works ah

936
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,460
take it the other way

937
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,000
um so this is tavis's uh home page and

938
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,500
and what you'll see

939
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,559
is just a list of bugs that Tevis had

940
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:26,700
found

941
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,599
before joining Google project zero okay

942
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,660
and this was all completely in his spare

943
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,900
time like this was just Tevis doing what

944
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,339
Tevis does

945
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:41,339
and and again what's interesting is if

946
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:45,119
someone looks at Tevis today you kind of

947
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,940
go well I could probably find bugs if I

948
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,220
was working full time at project zero

949
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,460
and working next to natashenka and and

950
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,680
that sort of stuff but Thomas was doing

951
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,500
it when he was doing it for free

952
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,440
auditing Debian packages for fun

953
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,799
okay and actually if we go back to this

954
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,240
page I'll show you something else that's

955
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,859
interesting

956
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:10,200
uh

957
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,299
if you go to the bottom like I can't

958
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:15,259
really see this

959
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,819
there's a thought

960
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:19,079
now I'm just gonna break everything

961
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:20,760
that's fine

962
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,640
um if you go down here you'll see he

963
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,220
lists a whole bunch of crack Mees a

964
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,200
whole bunch of hackmas

965
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,240
um for those of you who've never done it

966
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,640
um crack me is well the way lots of

967
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,280
people got into early reversing so

968
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,160
somebody puts together an app broken in

969
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,799
a certain way hey reverse the cereal

970
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,260
and and if you read through tevis's

971
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,839
comments um I included this in one of my

972
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,660
previous talks you get to one of them

973
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,380
where his he walks through his solution

974
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,900
and his solution spends more than a year

975
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,559
it's like played with the spota VM did

976
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,900
this and and again it's one of those

977
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,140
times when you realize that Tavis is

978
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,400
Tevis because he was born with crazy uh

979
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,559
off the charts alien IQ

980
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,359
his Tevis because in the times when we

981
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,720
were out or I was playing with my kid he

982
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,579
was doing crack knees and auditing

983
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:24,240
Debian packages and and it's totally

984
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,299
fine if you choose not to be a Tavis

985
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,660
like not everyone can but the problem

986
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,540
comes in when you want to be a Tavis

987
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,520
without putting in that level of work

988
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,339
because that's just uh fooling yourself

989
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,500
see if that comes back on

990
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,480
does

991
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,299
um yeah so so Tevis finds his stuff

992
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:50,819
because he's Tevis not because he works

993
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:54,180
for P0 Ben Rich builds the stealth not

994
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,339
because he works at Skunk Works but

995
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:58,079
because he's been rich

996
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,500
and we've got to ask whether we are that

997
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,619
person and and at this point the very

998
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:07,559
logical question is what about life

999
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:09,599
balance like like how does the life

1000
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,760
balance fit into this

1001
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,220
um and and this is a tricky one and and

1002
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,220
it's a tricky one especially now

1003
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,299
um and

1004
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:21,660
I'll give you a few mixed answers on it

1005
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,539
one again Hamming addresses it directly

1006
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,220
in his paper

1007
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,619
um in his paper he says look he had to

1008
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:31,440
neglect his wife some of the time

1009
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,480
um doing great work requires this

1010
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,859
neglect

1011
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:37,500
um in in the actual talk there's a q a

1012
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,440
that happens if you can read the talk or

1013
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,720
you can watch it on YouTube you should

1014
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,059
actually read it uh he's not that good a

1015
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:46,559
speaker and it takes away from it

1016
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,740
slightly but but in the actual video

1017
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,839
there's a q a section where they delve

1018
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,180
into this question more and he talks

1019
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,799
about the fact that yeah look you can

1020
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:57,960
choose to have a good life or you can

1021
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,200
choose to be a Nobel winning scientist

1022
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,240
um but you're choosing

1023
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,359
um that's just how it is and and these

1024
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:09,599
questions come up a few times recently

1025
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,059
um in part because of the insanity uh

1026
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,880
around musk and Twitter right now so so

1027
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,680
for those of you who don't recognize the

1028
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,099
meme uh one of the Twitter PMS shortly

1029
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:23,579
after their new boss uh came on tweeted

1030
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:26,280
about how she was sleeping in the office

1031
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,680
and and

1032
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,119
bunch of pain like I uh we have a

1033
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,059
company and we can't promote this sort

1034
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,160
of Lifestyle like if we did this we'd

1035
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,020
kill everyone working for us and nobody

1036
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,500
would work for us and unfortunately uh

1037
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,500
until fairly recently this used to cause

1038
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,099
me a bunch of uh consternation

1039
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,920
because in my young days like I've

1040
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,260
written Bunches of internal blog posts

1041
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,020
on how you only get goodness

1042
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,299
burning the candle at both ends like

1043
01:08:00,299 --> 01:08:03,720
like I used to be hardcore for you only

1044
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,880
get goodness by working yourself to

1045
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,660
death

1046
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,780
and at some point building things we had

1047
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,160
to say look if you want to build a

1048
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,260
sustainable company you can't build

1049
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,480
something like that and so we don't like

1050
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,719
we have a reasonable working times and

1051
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,580
lots of leave and all of that or we try

1052
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,420
to

1053
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,000
and for me it was still hard to

1054
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,460
reconcile because I still believe that

1055
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,580
this is true I've never seen great

1056
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,140
researchers

1057
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,299
who don't

1058
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,580
heavily towards workaholism when it

1059
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,219
comes to doing good research

1060
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:40,679
and and for a while I couldn't figure

1061
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:43,380
what that was but fortunately there's a

1062
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,679
loophole because building products for

1063
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:48,899
your company is not the same as doing

1064
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:51,238
security research that either becomes

1065
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:53,880
Nobel prize winning work or black at

1066
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,140
conference work

1067
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,080
one of them is something that you do and

1068
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,880
hopefully you do it well and hopefully

1069
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,920
you find a way that's sustainable

1070
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,319
but if you want to do great world-class

1071
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,560
research that's not the same thing and

1072
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,420
if you're lucky you find an org that

1073
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,819
sustains both of them the org will

1074
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,620
support you it'll let you do your stuff

1075
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,259
but if you ever think it's not going to

1076
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,719
take mind-bending work

1077
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,160
um you're lying to yourself and it's

1078
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,380
probably not going to work out too well

1079
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,060
for you

1080
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,160
um so really quickly I'm actually not

1081
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,779
sure of my time

1082
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:30,479
um some some quick pointers

1083
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,198
um one go read hemming totally worth it

1084
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:36,839
uh it'll change your life

1085
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,698
um two straight from his paper

1086
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:42,839
you need to periodically ask yourself

1087
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:45,000
whether you're working on interesting

1088
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,979
stuff like like whether you're working

1089
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,259
on stuff that's meaningful

1090
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,899
um in the paper hemming takes this to an

1091
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,000
extreme where he he meets people for

1092
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,820
lunch and asks them like what's the most

1093
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,860
interesting problems in your field and

1094
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,260
why aren't you working on them and he

1095
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,239
talks about how he stops getting invited

1096
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,400
to some tables uh after those

1097
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,860
conversations but it is interesting

1098
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,739
because we do the same thing in infosec

1099
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,560
there people who who call themselves

1100
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,320
researchers who want to do research and

1101
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,540
if you ask them well what what are you

1102
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,340
working on right now what's the

1103
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,560
interesting space you're looking into

1104
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,860
and you find they not and

1105
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,320
you can't possibly move forward or make

1106
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,940
great strides unless you actually

1107
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,880
choosing uh areas that matter

1108
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,880
one of the big things to avoid are the

1109
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,520
easy dopamine hits

1110
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,520
um and and you see these all over the

1111
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,179
show you see them for conference talks

1112
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:47,640
um we try to encourage Young Folks at

1113
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,400
the company to give talks to start uh

1114
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,739
building their muscle with doing

1115
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:55,920
research and giving talks and and it's

1116
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,900
really interesting to see how many times

1117
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,199
Young Folks will will give a talk

1118
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,820
and just

1119
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,340
surface of that talk so so they're

1120
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,920
looking into a topic and the stuff that

1121
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,719
they put together on the topic is the

1122
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,179
stuff that you could learn with an hour

1123
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:14,159
of research on the internet like like

1124
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,500
you could Google you could do it and you

1125
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,500
see this a lot at local conferences

1126
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,840
someone says okay there's a hot new

1127
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,780
topic on distributed apps like I'm gonna

1128
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,719
do a talk on dapps and the talk will

1129
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:30,179
start about why Bitcoin is good and why

1130
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,460
Satoshi did this and how it's being used

1131
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,900
in Ecuador

1132
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,480
and all of that stuff doesn't give them

1133
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,340
a deeper understanding of how the

1134
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,860
technology works and at the end of the

1135
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,360
day they get off the stage and they're

1136
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,159
now happy because they've given a talk

1137
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,620
but they haven't fundamentally learned

1138
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,020
the technology they've not gotten any

1139
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,780
deeper with that topic and instead what

1140
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,760
happens is you get this mini dopamine

1141
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,460
hit of being a speaker at a conference

1142
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,980
and you walk away and now you speak and

1143
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,719
you've got a speaker badge

1144
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,980
um

1145
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,140
it happened so much that like I'm

1146
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,600
starting to kick back against people who

1147
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,880
say they want to be a speaker like being

1148
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,400
a speaker isn't a thing like like if you

1149
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,440
want to be a researcher that's something

1150
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,199
like do the research but but one thing

1151
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:19,500
to speak uh is pretty empty

1152
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,640
um

1153
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,520
learn the trade not the trick so for

1154
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,760
years we did this uh we we gave classes

1155
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,679
at sense post on how to break into

1156
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:31,260
things and we spent a lot of time

1157
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,120
telling people that they needed to go

1158
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,460
deeper on everything they did and

1159
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,080
especially if you're interested in doing

1160
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,300
security research

1161
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,940
um stopping at the trick gives you such

1162
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,100
a surface level understanding of things

1163
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,920
and and you can spot those people who

1164
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,500
just constantly go deeper who take

1165
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,060
whatever they're looking at down to

1166
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,460
First principles to say this is how this

1167
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,040
thing fundamentally works because the

1168
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,500
jump from that to how do I break it or

1169
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,440
how do I abuse it uh is is much much

1170
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,360
smaller

1171
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,880
um I promise I'm almost done

1172
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,280
um the internet allows you to hang out

1173
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,380
with anyone

1174
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,900
um so there's an apocryphal quote about

1175
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,360
how you the average of The Five People

1176
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,060
You interact with most but it's super

1177
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,340
interesting that you have the internet

1178
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,520
which means you can hang out with anyone

1179
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,920
and most of us hang out with the same

1180
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,920
people we always have and and this is

1181
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,620
not uh me saying you should kick out

1182
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,540
your friends or kick out your besties

1183
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,239
but it is saying you should choose

1184
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,880
the people you spend time with and the

1185
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,219
people you emulate better

1186
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,179
um if

1187
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:44,760
you want to be a security researcher and

1188
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,780
if you are following halva and Dino and

1189
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,300
taviso one of the things that you'll

1190
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,600
pick up is their discipline as it comes

1191
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,600
down to research Time Project time work

1192
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,440
time

1193
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,560
and it's really easy to miss that stuff

1194
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,719
if you're following them and also happen

1195
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,080
to be following a bunch of comedians but

1196
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,300
yeah the internet allows you to pick

1197
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,179
your your five people well uh you should

1198
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:15,300
use it smartly

1199
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,960
um almost the last slide make more stuff

1200
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,580
um with a quick show of hands how many

1201
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,219
of you if you here have tweeted in the

1202
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:25,699
last month

1203
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,840
people are currently nervous how many of

1204
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,159
you have posted something on a Blog

1205
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,840
it's quite a few bloggers it's

1206
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,480
interesting uh any of you built and

1207
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,379
released software

1208
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,860
you don't count Punch Cards don't count

1209
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,920
um

1210
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,980
um no so so part of the reason why it's

1211
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,500
interesting is because if you put out

1212
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,920
anything you start to see the value in

1213
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,159
building stuff releasing stuff getting

1214
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:02,340
feedback on it and if if you're blogging

1215
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,800
for example and it's it's really really

1216
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,080
uh if you think about it shouldn't be

1217
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,420
that hard you start to be appreciative

1218
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,080
of 300 people who read your blog like a

1219
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,239
thousand people read your blog and it's

1220
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:17,280
like holy a thousand people just

1221
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,520
did this and and the problem is when you

1222
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,600
don't produce stuff those things skew so

1223
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,880
so you see someone release an app online

1224
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,580
and they get 10 000 users and you know

1225
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,040
that's not enough

1226
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,739
but if you wrote a blog post and got 300

1227
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,199
readers you'd celebrate if you got a

1228
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,900
thousand readers you'd celebrate and

1229
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,880
that's part of the thing that comes from

1230
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,880
just making stuff it it changes the way

1231
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,880
you think about it and uh the thing to

1232
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,580
note when you're building stuff is that

1233
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,860
it will suck um so if you haven't seen

1234
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,980
this uh I'll go one back because it's

1235
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,300
really worth it

1236
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,159
um if you haven't seen this video

1237
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:01,800
um I had a glass put out this video on

1238
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,739
uh making stuff and and why it's hard

1239
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:07,940
and it's super worth it

1240
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,659
is that up

1241
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,580
and currently you can hear it from my

1242
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,120
Mac speakers

1243
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,679
let me try again

1244
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,080
nobody tells people who are beginners

1245
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,580
and it really was something I told this

1246
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:35,100
to me is that um all of us who do

1247
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,659
creative work like you know we get into

1248
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:38,100
it and we get into it because we have

1249
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,840
good taste but it's like there's a gap

1250
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,520
that for the first couple years that

1251
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,020
you're making stuff

1252
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,179
what you're making isn't so good okay

1253
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:47,219
it's not that great it's it's trying to

1254
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:48,480
be good it has ambition to good but it's

1255
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,000
not quite that good but your taste the

1256
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,199
thing that got you into the game your

1257
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:54,540
taste is still killer and your taste is

1258
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,040
good enough that you can tell that what

1259
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,300
you're making is kind of a

1260
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,800
disappointment to you you know what I

1261
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,640
mean

1262
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,140
a lot of people never get past that

1263
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,400
phase a lot of people at that point they

1264
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,179
quit

1265
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:05,159
and the thing I would just like say to

1266
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,920
you with all my heart is that most

1267
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,620
everybody I know who does interesting

1268
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,540
creative work they went through a phase

1269
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,000
of years where they had really good

1270
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,199
taste and they could tell what they were

1271
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,640
making wasn't as good as they wanted it

1272
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,860
to be they knew it felt short it didn't

1273
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,659
have this special thing that we wanted

1274
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:24,239
to have and the thing I would say to you

1275
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,100
is everybody goes through that and for

1276
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,120
you to go through it if you're going

1277
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,440
through right now if you're just getting

1278
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,480
out of that phase you got to know it's

1279
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,400
totally normal and the most important

1280
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,679
possible thing you could do is do a lot

1281
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:36,840
of work do a huge volume of work put

1282
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,340
yourself on a deadline so that every

1283
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,780
week or every month you know you're

1284
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,000
going to finish one story because it's

1285
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,500
only by actually going through a volume

1286
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,300
of work that you're actually going to

1287
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,820
catch up and close that Gap

1288
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,739
or the work you're making will be as

1289
01:17:49,739 --> 01:17:53,219
good as your Ambitions in my case like I

1290
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,920
I took longer to figure out

1291
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,960
how to do this than anybody I've ever

1292
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,580
met

1293
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,620
takes a while it's going to take you a

1294
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,360
while it's normal to take a while and

1295
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,640
you just have to fight your way through

1296
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,540
that

1297
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,019
okay

1298
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,239
so now there's two things it's either

1299
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,580
Hemmings uh post or either glass on

1300
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,080
creativity

1301
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,380
um so just to end off again it's totally

1302
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,440
okay if you choose not to do security

1303
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,280
research like it's it's fine like it's

1304
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,960
totally your call

1305
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,719
um the main thing I want to avoid is is

1306
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:36,659
where we identify as reach researchers

1307
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,760
we say we want to do it and and we don't

1308
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,400
put in the work behind it

1309
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,260
um I I guess just to end off the

1310
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,900
question of is it worth it like like if

1311
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,000
we're saying it's uh affects your life

1312
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,800
all of this stuff

1313
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,960
um I can tell you personally

1314
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,659
um for me it's been amazing

1315
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:57,239
um and I can also tell you that in some

1316
01:18:57,239 --> 01:18:58,280
ways

1317
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,080
we put out this product called Canary

1318
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,500
tokens for for some of you who who might

1319
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,820
not know it for those of you who don't

1320
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,800
and one of the interesting things about

1321
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,320
Canary tokens is that fundamentally

1322
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,780
version one

1323
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,420
is crazy simple to do like like when we

1324
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,800
bought version one

1325
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,679
it's a weakened project create something

1326
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,440
random save it in a database if someone

1327
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,320
comes along or give that random thing to

1328
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,480
someone and later on say I gave it to

1329
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,699
this person literally you could build it

1330
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,580
in a weekend but we built this version

1331
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,280
one of canary tokens and then smarter

1332
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,159
people in the company added on to it and

1333
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,960
then shortly thereafter you started to

1334
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,360
get people saying hey this stuff saved

1335
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,280
me hey I didn't know that we were under

1336
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,280
attack and shortly after that you had

1337
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,500
people from Cruise automation doing

1338
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,420
talks on how they were deploying Canary

1339
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,120
tokens at scale or Colin mulliner who's

1340
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,980
done amazing research over the years

1341
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:59,520
talking about how he was using tokens uh

1342
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,640
to detect reverse engineering and

1343
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,580
Canadian tokens are so simple that

1344
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,620
anyone could have done it like literally

1345
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,140
if you learned programming today you

1346
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,300
could build version one of canary tokens

1347
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,880
this weekend

1348
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,520
but we did it and we put it out there

1349
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,460
and people built around it and good

1350
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,400
stuff happened and and last year in

1351
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,920
December like Canary tokens was used

1352
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,640
over 4 million times and and for us as

1353
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,380
people putting stuff out there it's

1354
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,260
incredibly helpful we don't charge for

1355
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,820
Canadian tokens but like if young

1356
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,280
Engineers want to join the company we

1357
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,980
get to say to them hey you can work on X

1358
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,199
or you can work on this thing that Colin

1359
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,780
Molina said was cool or this thing that

1360
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,540
last year four million people used and

1361
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,480
it becomes a no-brainer and and again

1362
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,300
it's just because we did it and and

1363
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,120
mainly that's my push is you should just

1364
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,620
do it

1365
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,780
um and and again Hamming talks about it

1366
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,420
and he says if you keep doing stuff

1367
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,480
sooner or later you'll do good stuff and

1368
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,820
and like we build tokens but it comes

1369
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,219
after years and years of putting out

1370
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:14,400
stuff that probably nobody else uh ever

1371
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,719
looked at

1372
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,540
um so the question is it worth it um for

1373
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,300
us we've built lifelong friends we've

1374
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,540
built careers totally worth it

1375
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,640
um it's hard but worth it

1376
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,500
um in summary you should build more

1377
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,440
stuff you should be kinder to people who

1378
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,719
are building stuff

1379
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:35,640
um you should hold yourself to a harder

1380
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,460
account like there's no reason we can't

1381
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,739
beat eversos there's no reason we can't

1382
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:43,260
build great companies

1383
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,239
um we just need to actually knuckle down

1384
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:46,440
into it

1385
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,320
um I'm harunmir on Twitter so you can uh

1386
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,960
tell me there why I suck or I think I've

1387
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,020
got a few moments uh for questions uh I

1388
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,679
do

1389
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,940
but thank you very much

1390
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,970
[Applause]

1391
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,179
we have to repeat the question but it

1392
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:13,620
starts with someone having a question

1393
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,480
Charles gonna have a question

1394
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:26,599
relative value of

1395
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,440
you're going to make those sacrifices

1396
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,360
set your life balance for yourself into

1397
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,100
something why

1398
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,400
why

1399
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:47,820
yeah um so so to repeat the question uh

1400
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,860
what do you think of the relative value

1401
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:52,140
of security research

1402
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,940
um given that South Africa has a bunch

1403
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,000
of problems why should and given that

1404
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,480
doing security research has uh costs why

1405
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,080
spend it on X and not why

1406
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,500
um I don't have a good answer to it I I

1407
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,739
think uh Ben Horowitz when asked about

1408
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:15,360
uh how kids should choose their career

1409
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,460
um he says Don't Follow Your Passion

1410
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,880
follow the intersection of what you can

1411
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,739
do what you can do well and where

1412
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:26,280
there's a need and and so for example I

1413
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,580
think I would make a terrible plumber

1414
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,640
um I think if if like the choice was uh

1415
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,400
Plumbing or solving something computer

1416
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,580
geekery I'm better aimed at that and and

1417
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,100
so I think it kind of becomes something

1418
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,719
like that which is you choose the

1419
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,780
intersection of your talent and your

1420
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,000
interests and where there's a need and

1421
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,159
it also happens to be a need here like

1422
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,860
like for us in South Africa I think

1423
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,400
software is aside from security research

1424
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,580
I think building software companies is

1425
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,040
hugely potentially valuable

1426
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,440
um I think like if you look at you look

1427
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,360
at the outliers you look at the big U.S

1428
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,120
companies we can build those companies

1429
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,880
like there's no reason why we can't like

1430
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,340
we have the same grads coming out we've

1431
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,860
got the same skills

1432
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,679
there's no reason for and and the

1433
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,320
economy needs it the country needs it so

1434
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,140
so I think you can yeah I think there's

1435
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,659
there's value in it but I think it has a

1436
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:29,520
cost uh how you weigh it against other

1437
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,960
costs

1438
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,060
I I don't know a good answer to it

1439
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,800
um anyone else

1440
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,199
we've got to cut it or Crystal is going

1441
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:41,880
to cut my neck off I'm not sure what

1442
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,900
that means

1443
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,159
um thank you very much folks

1444
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:52,370
[Applause]

1445
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,980
sorry to cut it short but just a quick

1446
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,020
couple of announcements one there is

1447
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,120
coffee and some like breakfast style

1448
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,280
stuff if you want to run down to the

1449
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,040
first floor quickly then track two is

1450
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,260
going to start the same time as the next

1451
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,800
talk which is one floor down then Mike's

1452
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,960
gonna hate me for this but there's a

1453
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,840
hackable vending machine in some state

1454
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,520
of work King if you know Mike Davis you

1455
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,239
usually have burns from uh soldering

1456
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,520
iron from the night before working with

1457
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,760
him so I've not been involved this time

1458
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,280
but I know there's some state of a

1459
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,440
vending machine attackable with prizes

1460
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,460
in it

1461
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,300
in the eating area

1462
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:42,420
and then the workshops also start at 11.

1463
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,980
so in 10 minutes next talk here next

1464
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,199
talk in track two and in the next 10

1465
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,659
minutes you're welcome to grab uh food

1466
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:55,140
coffee and if you're gonna stay here try

1467
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,520
and fill up the space because there's

1468
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,780
quite a lot of people at the back

1469
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,599
foreign

1470
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:17,178
you

1471
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:22,580
should have brought my MacBook

1472
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,679
yeah I'm not the only one who's not it

1473
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,480
is you know what it's enough made to

1474
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,040
find a bag for this because it doesn't

1475
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,440
fit in anything I'll believe you

1476
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,040
uh so you always like jamming it in

1477
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,380
uh how does this thing come down

1478
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,500

01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,480
little bit better for the last coming

1511

while the video is going

1523
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,000
that's full on the laptop yeah

1524
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,860
that this is coming through PowerPoint

1525
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,739
so I don't think there's a way to

1526
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:54,179
no

1527
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:57,739
this is coming through PowerPoint

1528
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,520
uh what if we do la karoon did with the

1529
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,840
Mark at the speaker

1531
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,540

1532
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,300
I don't I actually don't know if I have

1533
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:53,060
me out I was somewhere let's see

1534
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,360
foreign

1535
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:33,480
now I have never seen Simon Cowell get

1536
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,760
to his feet as fast as he did when he

1537
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,480
saw this app mind you he was the ACT if

1538
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,900
none of

1539
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,699
them see look I'm on harm if you look at

1540
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,219
my settings can you see all right I'm on

1541
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:03,139
I'm on the highest it can go for volume

1542
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,060
foreign

1543
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:52,320
I don't know where you would change the

1544
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,179
um let me get a hold of this stuff for

1545
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:57,020
you because you'll know

1546
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,699
what do you which which program are you

1547
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:05,719
using PowerPoint

1548
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,580
General

1549
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,199
I don't see an option for audio

1550
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:39,179
yeah because I'll show you when I click

1551
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:41,280
on the video

1552
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,620
and I'm going to play back the volume

1553
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,719
the shifts are high so it's as high as

1554
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:48,920
it can go in

1555
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,040
and I don't know if it is a way I've

1556
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,440
never seen there probably is a way to

1557
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,199
edit it yeah but uh not one that I know

1558
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:06,980
and if you're active on it an actual

1559
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,759
there's a lot of volumes

1560
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,100
if he knows

1561
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,239
yes

1562
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:24,050
[Music]

1563
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,620
everyone's welcome to sit so long we're

1564
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,840
just dealing with technical difficulties

1565
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,280
so press play on your on yours

1566
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,540
no it's coming through the HDMI

1567
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,880
so it's coming through here like I said

1568
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,679
particularly change can we can we change

1569
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,560
the output and go to your app we can go

1570
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,120
to speakers

1571
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,840
volume

1572
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:07,699
practical

1573
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:11,719
and go to open sound settings

1574
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,179
and then your output

1575
01:40:14,179 --> 01:40:17,159
why is my master volume is so low maybe

1576
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:19,139
that's part of the problem part of it

1577
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:21,420
because beef is up with the front okay

1578
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,760
right up to 100

1579
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,000
yeah I don't have any other options

1580
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,760
is that as far as it goes okay

1581
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,199
okay

1582
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:32,580
um

1583
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:35,580

thank you

1589
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,199
I think they should be able to hear that

1590
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,500
and there's no one talking

1591
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,139

um was not intended there's always

1615
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,860
problems with sound so you always just

1616
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,840

1617
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,600

01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,760
simultaneously while making one thing

1645
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,520
uh something that I am super proud of

1646
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,179
that I sit and do in my free time is an

1647
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:23,760
initiative called Pay It Forward

1648
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,159
um I got a really great opportunity to

1649
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,139
get into the information security field

1650
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:31,139
through an internship and it was as

1651
01:45:31,139 --> 01:45:33,480
cheesy as it sounds life-changing for me

1652
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,820
and it became a personal goal to be able

1653
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:37,440
to do the same thing for other people

1654
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,840
and I got the opportunity to do that a

1655
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,139
lot sooner than I had planned and up to

1656
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:44,719
today

1657
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,420
the paid for initiative has given 19

1658
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:52,860
people a pwk voucher so for anyone who

1659
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:54,179
doesn't know that's the course to get

1660
01:45:54,179 --> 01:45:56,760
your oscp certification

1661
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:01,199
um and that's 90 days of the lab that's

1662
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:03,179
full access to the course the videos and

1663
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:07,260
and exam voucher so uh like I've made

1664
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,540
two of my candidates today who are Cape

1665
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,540
Town based I'm joburg based and that's

1666
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,340
something that you know I get a lot of

1667
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:17,179
satisfaction out of doing

1668
01:46:17,179 --> 01:46:20,219
so you know just to start with a little

1669
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:23,040
disclaimer this presentation is going to

1670
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,260
contain deep fake material no

1671
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:26,820
infringements is intended I'm not

1672
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:28,320
entirely sure if some of the stuff I've

1673
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:32,239
done is totally legal but we'll see

1674
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,800
um all right cool so what is a deep fake

1675
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,080
everyone's probably heard of that

1676
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,280
um and there's different kinds of

1677
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,659
defects and there's different kind of

1678
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:41,280
Technology that's used to make these

1679
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,179
things

1680
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:43,560
um but essentially what it's doing is

1681
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,980
it's taking some kind of base media and

1682
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,080
it's manipulating it in such a way that

1683
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,699
it now appears to be something else

1684
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:54,300
whether that is done with imagery or

1685
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,760
videos or audio or a combination of all

1686
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,820
of them that's essentially a defect

1687
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,920
in very very simple terms now what

1688
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,020
people seem to enjoy doing is putting

1689
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,900
Steve Buscemi's face on a lot of celebs

1690
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,340
and they tend to be women so it's this

1691
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,540
really weird thing where you see like

1692
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,000
Steve Buscemi's face a lot

1693
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,619
um and

1694
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:16,139
you can literally Google like a deep

1695
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:17,760
fake before and after and you'll see a

1696
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:18,960
lot of these things and a lot of Steve

1697
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,800
Buscemi and uh I have dubbed at the face

1698
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,600
replace because essentially what they're

1699
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,820
just doing is they're taking uh and

1700
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,159
they're not changing the majority of the

1701
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:30,719
image they're just sticking someone

1702
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:32,639
else's face on it

1703
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,940
and I think that there's a lot of really

1704
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:40,380
really poorly done deep folks online but

1705
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:41,639
then you get some really really good

1706
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:43,080
ones and at the moment they're the

1707
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,199
exception and not the rules so I don't

1708
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:48,900
know why this is showing us blank

1709
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:51,600
um this is and I hope you don't go deaf

1710
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,159
um this is someone called Deep Tom

1711
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:55,380
Cruise uh this guy's name is Miles

1712
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,179
Fisher and I'm going to tell you a

1713
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:58,619
little bit more about him after I show

1714
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:01,820
you kind of what he's known for

1715
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:07,500
please play comply

1716
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,480
Paris I don't want to be late to this

1717
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,739
Premiere we gotta go

1718
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,560
ES

1719
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:27,660
[Music]

1720
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:39,119
anything a story in my life

1721
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,040
all right now we're gonna skydiving this

1722
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,100
thing you ready I do my own stunts

1723
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,639
all right so uh Miles Fisher is not Tom

1724
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:49,500
Cruise obviously so the person in that

1725
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,480
video is not Tom Cruise at all it is the

1726
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,280
real Paris Hilton

1727
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,739
um and uh Miles Fisher works with a

1728
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:58,920
company uh called metaphysic and meta

1729
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,860
metaphysic specialized in

1730
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:03,960
um AI technology but essentially they're

1731
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,540
creating deep fakes and in my opinion

1732
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,520
they are the people that are creating

1733
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:11,639
the most convincing deep fakes so a lot

1734
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:13,860
of this uh introductory stuff does deal

1735
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,900
with a lot of kind of popular culture

1736
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,940
but I think that it does just show how

1737
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,360
impressive some of this stuff can be so

1738
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,860
metaphysic actually entered America's

1739
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,420
Got Talent I mean that's quite an

1740
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,460
unusual contest and to have a tech

1741
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,100
company into a talent show but you're

1742
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,360
gonna see

1743
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,940
I have never seen Simon Cowell get to

1744
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,219
his feet as fast as he did when he saw

1745
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:39,119
this app mind you he was the ACT if none

1746
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,100
of that makes any sense it will in a

1747
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:45,320
minute here's metaphysic

1748
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,480
now

1749
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,480
so I mean Heidi Klum is absolutely

1750
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,119
losing her Simon Cowell is is uh

1751
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:16,800
shocked and you can see that there's

1752
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,179
three people that have walked onto the

1753
01:50:18,179 --> 01:50:20,100
stage and on the big screen behind them

1754
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:24,619
is this picture of Elvis seemingly live

1755
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:44,419
all right

1756
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:51,900
so I've been apart from seeing Simon

1757
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,340
Cowell's wonderful reaction of seeing

1758
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,840
himself as a performer it's it's it's

1759
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,000
really impressive what they're doing so

1760
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,580
metaphysic is uh was created one of the

1761
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,639
creators his name is Chris um

1762
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:06,119
and they specialize in especially these

1763
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:08,219
real-time deep fakes of being able to

1764
01:51:08,219 --> 01:51:11,040
kind of superimpose one likeness on top

1765
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,560
of another person's face

1766
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,780
um and coming back to Miles Fisher so

1767
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:18,420
that is Miles Fisher his real likeness

1768
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,280
on the left and obviously Tom Cruise on

1769
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,219
the right and the thing is is that these

1770
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:26,179
kind of deep fakes uh or AI technology

1771
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:29,460
uh it has some limitations and I want to

1772
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,860
take you through them so despite them

1773
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:34,020
being really really good and you know

1774
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,580
they can do it in real time and it's

1775
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:39,060
it's super impressive uh Miles Fisher is

1776
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:41,639
a professional Tom Cruise impersonator

1777
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:44,639
this guy has a similar likeness so he

1778
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,020
doesn't look exactly the same but

1779
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:49,080
there's a likeness there he has learned

1780
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:52,440
how to sound like Tom Cruise's voice so

1781
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,500
there's no editing or anything like that

1782
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,540
anything they need to change there when

1783
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,940
it comes to his voice some of the

1784
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:03,600
limitations as well is you know these uh

1785
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,159
this technology struggles a little bit

1786
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:07,320
like is the hairline of miles and Tom

1787
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,239
exactly the same is their jawline the

1788
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:11,280
same their mannerisms how much of them

1789
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,659
like an emotion and expression do you

1790
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:15,000
you get when this AI is sticking someone

1791
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,540
else's face on yours and that tends to

1792
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,880
be where it kind of it starts to look

1793
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,440
fake and

1794
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,000
these things are going to get so good

1795
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,619
that you're going to have to trust your

1796
01:52:25,619 --> 01:52:27,360
instincts and be like hey I don't know

1797
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,860
that thing just there's just something

1798
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:30,960
about it in maybe one frame that just

1799
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,360
doesn't look right but anyway we're

1800
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,860
getting a little bit sidetracked here so

1801
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:37,020
we are hackers right so we want to think

1802
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:39,000
how can we use this kind of stuff

1803
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,060
um in an offensive way right

1804
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,460
um so if you want to have a deep fake of

1805
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,380
someone for whatever reason we'll get to

1806
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,020
motive a little bit later there's going

1807
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:50,940
to be some challenges right so you have

1808
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,800
to have your targets and you're gonna

1809
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,420
have to find someone who looks like your

1810
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,040
Target and then they're also going to

1811
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,239
have to be on board with whatever

1812
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,820
illegal activity you're doing so

1813
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:01,920
you might not want to do that for

1814
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,219
various reasons okay so uh how do you

1815
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:08,460
actually weaponize a deep fake right

1816
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:09,780
um and that's the question I asked

1817
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,460
myself and I'm going to take you through

1818
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,440
how I did it I'm sure that there are a

1819
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,300
lot of different ways to do it this is

1820
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,460
just my way um and then I also kind of

1821
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,380
realized that the talk probably should

1822
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:20,820
have been called Deep fakes for dummies

1823
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,560
because that's just essentially what it

1824
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,880
is

1825
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:24,960
um

1826
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,780
and I want to take you to I want to take

1827
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:30,719
you through the two aspects of um speech

1828
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,580
in the in the visual kind of way so that

1829
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:34,380
you're hearing me talk but you're also

1830
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,119
seeing me talk

1831
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:38,280
um and the first thing is how a mouth

1832
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:41,159
moves and uh one of the aspects is

1833
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:44,580
called a vizim so viz like Visual and

1834
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,440
what that means is just there are

1835
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,360
certain mouth movements that accompany

1836
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,100
the words or the sounds that you're

1837
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,580
making and you will not really realize

1838
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,500
that you're doing it because I think

1839
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,139
everyone here is hearing

1840
01:53:58,139 --> 01:53:59,699
um so we kind of think of this as

1841
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:01,320
something that hearing impaired people

1842
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,719
do but you will do this on a

1843
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:05,580
subconscious level and you will know

1844
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:09,900
when there is a a disjoint between what

1845
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:12,239
is being said visually and what are you

1846
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:14,940
hearing from an audio perspective so

1847
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:17,460
what I found is a really great way to

1848
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,560
kind of demonstrate this is there's a

1849
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,659
YouTube channel and they do what they

1850
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:23,520
call bad lip syncing so if there's any

1851
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,739
stranger stranger things things fans

1852
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:30,019
here this one is especially for you

1853
01:54:37,139 --> 01:54:39,540
like most 12 year olds back then my

1854
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,100
family life revolved after a dinner

1855
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,500
table I have to do something wicked in

1856
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,880
my talent show well you needed

1857
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,619
Impressions actually I thought I would

1858
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:49,560
just say super freak hey I got a lovely

1859
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,619
tattoo I'll show you when you're done is

1860
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:55,440
it a whale no it's cool but is it super

1861
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,199
free wine glass there must be jealousy

1862
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:00,000
in this house what is a boy jealous

1863
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,340
cause I'm sure not next you get to clean

1864
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:04,619
dad's back you know what I'm gonna shove

1865
01:55:04,619 --> 01:55:06,960
you under the couch and leave what'd he

1866
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,520
just say how would you shove her are you

1867
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,540
scared the soup out of me

1868
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:14,940
well she's not super freak you're a kid

1869
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,420
that I am

1870
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,440
all right so if you've watched stranger

1871
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:20,760
things you're going to realize that that

1872
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,219
was definitely not part of the show and

1873
01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:24,540
what you're hearing sometimes doesn't

1874
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,159
make sense it's like a cohesive

1875
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:29,280
conversation but it'll look dry it all

1876
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,659
sounded right between what you were

1877
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:33,119
hearing and seeing so we come to the

1878
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,280
second part of this and this is uh

1879
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,920
what's actually being said so

1880
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,560
um these are called phonemes and what

1881
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,320
phonemes mean is it's just we can only

1882
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:46,260
make a certain variety of sounds and

1883
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:48,480
when we speak we kind of combine these

1884
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,100
sounds in different ways to make words

1885
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:52,139
and then magically other people know

1886
01:55:52,139 --> 01:55:53,820
what you're saying because they also

1887
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,500
understand the same kind of sounds

1888
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,719
you're making so that is an

1889
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:00,480
oversimplification of phonetics but it's

1890
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,100
good enough for the purposes that we

1891
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:02,940
need

1892
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:06,480
so how do we use this again and

1893
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,860
generally when you're speaking about

1894
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:12,540
making some kind of vocal clone you need

1895
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:16,440
a data set and data sets you can

1896
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:18,480
sometimes compensate like do you need

1897
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,179
quality or do you need quantity but when

1898
01:56:21,179 --> 01:56:23,580
it comes to cloning people's voices you

1899
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,440
actually need both and there's no

1900
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,020
shortcut around that so what a lot of

1901
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,440
places do like researchers they use

1902
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,300
celebrities and politicians because

1903
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,760
they're natural data sets these people

1904
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:39,540
speak and they speak a lot so you like

1905
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,520
Joe Rogan for example

1906
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,560
um I did a talk two years ago and I used

1907
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:46,440
Joe Rogan because he literally is just a

1908
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,480
walking data set with his uh with his

1909
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:53,219
podcasts so another great example is as

1910
01:56:53,219 --> 01:56:58,280
I said politicians so let's hear

1911
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,080
hello I'm Barack Obama and I have been

1912
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,820
convinced to say some ridiculous things

1913
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:06,840
for besides Cape Town 2022

1914
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,460
pretty easy to do you just kind of punch

1915
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,139
it into Google once again it will take

1916
01:57:10,139 --> 01:57:12,179
you to a site cool I want to say

1917
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:14,760
something as Obama and it's done so

1918
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,699
hello

1919
01:57:16,699 --> 01:57:19,679
we don't need to hear you again

1920
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,860
um so what kind of tools do you do you

1921
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,179
use if you want to have a little bit

1922
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:26,580
more control over this yourself and

1923
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:29,340
Barack Obama is not your uh your target

1924
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,020
so

1925
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:33,239
um this there's various tools the first

1926
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:34,380
one I'm going to talk about is called

1927
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:37,619
descript this used to be called lyrebird

1928
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:39,060
um I've spoken a little bit before about

1929
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,699
lybird and it's a really really good

1930
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:44,060
technology for creating vocal clones

1931
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:47,580
another one is called Murph Ai and then

1932
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:49,500
a third one that I came across is called

1933
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,179
resemble AI

1934
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:53,580
and why I was particularly interested in

1935
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:56,099
resemble AI is because when you get into

1936
01:57:56,099 --> 01:57:58,560
their dashboard you see this option and

1937
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,239
I thought Bingo this is exactly what I

1938
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,219
need when I've experimented with these

1939
01:58:02,219 --> 01:58:03,780
tools before I've generally done it with

1940
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,400
my own voice which is easy because you

1941
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,840
know I'm in this machine and I can do

1942
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:08,099
whatever I want

1943
01:58:08,099 --> 01:58:09,480
um but if I'm trying to clone someone

1944
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,460
else's voice this just makes it a whole

1945
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,599
lot easier

1946
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:14,340
but it didn't work so I thought okay

1947
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,719
well that makes sense they're not going

1948
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:18,360
to let you do it for free so I stuck my

1949
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,760
credit card or not a credit cards

1950
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,239
numbers in and bingo I've been upgraded

1951
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:27,480
so that's wonderful but it still didn't

1952
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,060
work so what do you do next you email

1953
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,739
support because well it's not working

1954
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:33,300
and then I realized why it's not working

1955
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,619
because I need 15 000 USD to mess around

1956
01:58:37,619 --> 01:58:39,360
with this tool and as much as I'm

1957
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,099
invested in my research like I just

1958
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:43,679
don't have that amount of money to to

1959
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,840
mess around with that so

1960
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,760
we're not going to do that right we're

1961
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:50,520
just going to be moving along so I took

1962
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:51,900
a little bit of a step back and I

1963
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,619
thought

1964
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:54,719
who should I Target like who's going to

1965
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:57,300
be someone who's got a good data set

1966
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:59,460
that I can work with and that would be

1967
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:00,719
relevant because a lot of these things

1968
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:03,060
that we see work with uh you know

1969
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,699
politicians in America or you know Putin

1970
01:59:05,699 --> 01:59:08,280
in Russia and um let's let's try and

1971
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:10,260
make it as local as possible

1972
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:12,900
so who else but let's see our presidents

1973
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:15,360
and let's see all right so you just do a

1974
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,760
Google Search and you do for videos and

1975
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,920
there's over a million so cool data set

1976
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,500
box checked

1977
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,360
um Anna the actual attack so now I've

1978
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:25,980
got to figure out our cool how am I

1979
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:29,159
actually going to do this and uh my kind

1980
01:59:29,159 --> 01:59:30,960
of outlook on this especially when I do

1981
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,580
social engineering which essentially

1982
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:35,099
this is is that if you start like you

1983
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:36,840
try and stay as close to the truth as

1984
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,760
possible something's going to be a lot

1985
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:42,179
more successful because uh it just kind

1986
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:44,099
of minimizes your chances of getting

1987
01:59:44,099 --> 01:59:45,540
quotes out

1988
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:47,400
well kind of that's what I thought right

1989
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,219
so if anyone has tried to mess around

1990
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:52,679
with any kind of Sound Engineering or

1991
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:53,940
anything like that you might know this

1992
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,060
logo this is for a tool called audacity

1993
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:59,880
it's uh 100 open source

1994
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,460
uh and it allows you to do a whole bunch

1995
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:06,060
of things so I downloaded audacity and I

1996
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:08,000
then started trolling through YouTube

1997
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,260
and you go through a whole bunch of

1998
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:12,840
transcripts and you you you have an idea

1999
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,400
of what you want to do

2000
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,780
um and you start downloading these

2001
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:19,320
things and uh listening and taking out

2002
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:21,000
what you need

2003
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,040
so what I created and what I'm calling

2004
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,340
this is a vocal quilt I am taking things

2005
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:29,040
that have really been said but I'm using

2006
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,300
from different places and I'm

2007
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:32,940
rearranging it in a way that is

2008
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:36,060
something Cyril never said I don't know

2009
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,920
how big it is on the screen but if you

2010
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,219
read the uh the notes that I've made it

2011
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:43,260
says escom will increase load shedding

2012
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,300
over the next 12 months which is what we

2013
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,219
all want to hear right

2014
02:00:47,219 --> 02:00:51,420
um so cool so we've got the uh what has

2015
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:54,360
been said sorted in a very very simple

2016
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:57,199
way like we did not use high-tech

2017
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,760
Solutions here we really kept it very

2018
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,760
very simple but that's sorted but now as

2019
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,380
you've seen the mouth has got to move

2020
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,000
the right way otherwise it's just going

2021
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,239
to look very very weird

2022
02:01:09,239 --> 02:01:11,580
uh and if you edit that in such a way

2023
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:13,500
you're going to have those uh like those

2024
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,239
weird breaks and it's not going to flow

2025
02:01:15,239 --> 02:01:16,800
in the same way as someone who's just

2026
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,440
speaking like in the moment

2027
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:22,080
so how do we do this mouth manipulation

2028
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:25,020
and you know the internet is a very very

2029
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:28,199
wonderful place uh chances are you are

2030
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:30,119
not the first person to think of what

2031
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:32,099
you're doing so you need to just look

2032
02:01:32,099 --> 02:01:33,780
around and see if the solution you need

2033
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:36,300
already exists and it does in

2034
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:38,280
there are various Solutions but this is

2035
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,440
the one I went with so you literally go

2036
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,139
into GitHub it's called wave tiller wave

2037
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:45,060
tulip and it does exactly what it says

2038
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:48,179
on the on the slide that you can lip

2039
02:01:48,179 --> 02:01:51,360
sync a video and audio that can come

2040
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,340
from completely different places and

2041
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,380
make it look right so

2042
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,060
what we're winning here is that we're

2043
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,619
doing all of this stuff locally we're

2044
02:01:58,619 --> 02:02:00,179
not doing this on some kind of web app

2045
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:02,760
where we're going to leave some Trace

2046
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:05,040
um and we have that kind of sense of

2047
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,560
control over it so this is what it looks

2048
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,599
like when you're using it it's a command

2049
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:11,340
line based tool

2050
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,500
um I don't think that it's particularly

2051
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,380
difficult I think anyone who's a little

2052
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:18,900
bit Savvy will be able to figure it out

2053
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,520
just getting it installed is literally

2054
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,320
the most difficult part we'll Chuck a

2055
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,820
bunch of areas at you once you get those

2056
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:26,520
sorted you're good to go

2057
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,520
um and you're going to see what I was

2058
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,179
able to create

2059
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:35,520
escom will increase load shedding over

2060
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,860
the next 12 months

2061
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:40,020
now everyone's going to have a different

2062
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:41,400
opinion whether you think that that's

2063
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,800
convincing or not so again please

2064
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,119
remember that this is really really

2065
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:47,099
quite low-tech Solutions it can

2066
02:02:47,099 --> 02:02:49,440
obviously get much much better but the

2067
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,540
benefit here is that we're all used to

2068
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:54,239
seeing a Cyril with that backdrop we got

2069
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:55,980
quite accustomed to it during lockdown

2070
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,719
so you know that's like second nature

2071
02:02:57,719 --> 02:02:59,400
seeing him there

2072
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,040
um and it's quite believable from that

2073
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:03,780
perspective

2074
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,060
um also what I'm going to show you is

2075
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:08,280
the original versus what I did so that

2076
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,320
you can see that you still have those

2077
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,060
natural kind of gestations and body

2078
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:15,440
movement from him speaking

2079
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:18,540
escom will increase load shedding over

2080
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:21,920
the next 12 months

2081
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,719
so all right we've created a deep fake

2082
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:27,119
where we can impersonate or have some

2083
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:28,739
kind of level of control over our

2084
02:03:28,739 --> 02:03:31,260
presidents but what is our motive behind

2085
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:34,920
this uh if you work in the information

2086
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,840
security industry which I'm sure a lot

2087
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:39,179
of people here do you know the power of

2088
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:41,940
information and equally if not more

2089
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:43,739
powerful is

2090
02:03:43,739 --> 02:03:47,040
um disinformation so what is this

2091
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,199
information it's being able to use

2092
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:51,900
something in a way to convince someone

2093
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:53,699
of something that is just entirely

2094
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:57,060
untrue and then to be able to leverage

2095
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:59,880
that to some kind of end goal which is

2096
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:02,099
you know we're now talking politically

2097
02:04:02,099 --> 02:04:04,800
here at some kind of uh destabilization

2098
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,739
or control or in whatever capacity that

2099
02:04:07,739 --> 02:04:09,480
uh that goes to

2100
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:12,900
uh I would explain this but um I think

2101
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:16,020
that uh sorry I'm getting to a video so

2102
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:17,820
I'm losing my place slightly so I want

2103
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:19,920
to introduce you to something called

2104
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,380
operation in fiction and operation

2105
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:23,760
infection

2106
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:28,320
um was a a team and a task done by the

2107
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,699
KGB

2108
02:04:29,699 --> 02:04:32,280
and what they specialized in was

2109
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:33,679
disinformation

2110
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,619
agents spent 25 of their time actively

2111
02:04:37,619 --> 02:04:40,560
coming up with ideas for disinformation

2112
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,679
like how can we destabilize using

2113
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:46,440
just crazy information right

2114
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:49,699
um and there's a brilliant Tree

2115
02:04:49,699 --> 02:04:53,219
by the New York Times which explains it

2116
02:04:53,219 --> 02:04:56,000
incredibly well

2117
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,719
come on

2118
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:08,699
three and all the way over here in Delhi

2119
02:05:08,699 --> 02:05:11,159
India this is when a remarkable story

2120
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:13,020
appears in a newspaper called The

2121
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:16,139
Patriot it claims the HIV virus was

2122
02:05:16,139 --> 02:05:18,119
secretly created by U.S government

2123
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:21,360
scientists as a weapon to kill African

2124
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:24,239
Americans and gay people the river names

2125
02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:26,460
of facility for Dietrich in Maryland

2126
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:28,440
where the virus was supposed to have

2127
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,380
been concocted it's a crazy allegation

2128
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:34,560
printed in a small newspaper no big deal

2129
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,320
right but fast forward just a couple of

2130
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,659
years and look what's happening a story

2131
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:43,199
is spreading all over Africa a

2132
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:45,420
scientific reports even published by two

2133
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:47,760
East German biologists who say they can

2134
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,599
prove AIDS was made in the USA all these

2135
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:53,340
articles are from just a few months at

2136
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,400
the end of 1986

2137
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,540
and then somehow

2138
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:00,540
it ends up here

2139
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:03,179
a subject military publication claims

2140
02:06:03,179 --> 02:06:05,820
the virus that causes AIDS late from a

2141
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:07,560
U.S army laboratory conducting

2142
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,500
experiments in biological warfare and it

2143
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,900
stands over reading a fake news story to

2144
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:15,119
millions of unwitting Americans on

2145
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:17,960
national TV

2146
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:20,699
so that sums it up

2147
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:24,420
this operation in particular was really

2148
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:26,460
really successful and it had really

2149
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:28,679
really long lasting results and there's

2150
02:06:28,679 --> 02:06:30,360
probably a lot of people who still think

2151
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,580
that this is the case and I'm sure

2152
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:34,500
everyone here knows someone who thinks

2153
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:38,460
that covert was released from a facility

2154
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:40,739
a government facility so you know these

2155
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:43,020
things like they they start to kind of

2156
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:44,400
like repeat themselves and they're kind

2157
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,739
of dangerous ideas because there's a lot

2158
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:48,780
that you can do with this and

2159
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:51,540
um this is just a wonderful little uh

2160
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:54,179
statistic and this speaks about how many

2161
02:06:54,179 --> 02:06:56,520
people so this was the first time it was

2162
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,719
published just to remind you of the

2163
02:06:57,719 --> 02:07:01,440
dates was 1983 that television broadcast

2164
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,780
was 1987.

2165
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:06,840
um so you know five years later a lot of

2166
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,420
people 15 of Americans still think um

2167
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:12,420
that that the AIDS virus or HIV AIDS was

2168
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:14,940
released from a government Laboratory

2169
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:19,199
um in 2005 50 of African Americans

2170
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:21,659
thoughts Aid was man-made and you can

2171
02:07:21,659 --> 02:07:24,599
read the rest so despite the scientific

2172
02:07:24,599 --> 02:07:26,340
Community kind of fighting back and

2173
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:28,020
being like this is absolute nonsense

2174
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:30,179
there is no truth to this

2175
02:07:30,179 --> 02:07:31,980
um it doesn't matter like the damage is

2176
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:33,300
already done

2177
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:34,980
um so you can try and fight this and and

2178
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:37,080
the Americans did they had a task forces

2179
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:38,880
of course they will

2180
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,580
um you know the the idea is there you've

2181
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:43,199
planted the seed you've done the damage

2182
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:45,599
and therefore you've actually been quite

2183
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:46,800
successful

2184
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,840
and the difference now obviously between

2185
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:51,960
1983 and today's you know we have the

2186
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,239
internet so it's pretty obvious so if

2187
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:56,159
the KGB were able to pull off something

2188
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:58,320
like that when you were relying on like

2189
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,420
you know hard printed newspapers and

2190
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:03,119
stuff like that we can do a lot of

2191
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,199
damage

2192
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:06,719
um in whatever kind of vehicle we choose

2193
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:09,000
but using the internet is particularly

2194
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,980
useful for this kind of thing

2195
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:13,020
and it's kind of broken down into seven

2196
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,540
steps so it's about finding the cracks

2197
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:17,400
in whatever Society you're trying to

2198
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:20,340
attack you then create the lie and it's

2199
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,500
a big bold lie but you have to find that

2200
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,320
that element of truth to it the fourth

2201
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,940
part is making sure that you conceal

2202
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:28,739
your hand and people don't know that you

2203
02:08:28,739 --> 02:08:30,420
were responsible for doing that thing

2204
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:33,420
and then find someone who's an idiot and

2205
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:35,460
who can back you up right because that's

2206
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:37,619
useful especially if it's got doctors in

2207
02:08:37,619 --> 02:08:38,940
front because people are like hey he

2208
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:40,139
must know who he's like what he's

2209
02:08:40,139 --> 02:08:43,139
talking about the sixth step is to just

2210
02:08:43,139 --> 02:08:45,119
deny everything because you know what

2211
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,500
are people going to do if you say you

2212
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,780
didn't do it and then it's about just

2213
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:50,400
playing the long game and just waiting

2214
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,139
and seeing if what you did actually

2215
02:08:52,139 --> 02:08:54,420
worked and sometimes it's not going to

2216
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:55,920
and sometimes it's going to work really

2217
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,000
really well

2218
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,699
uh and then if we think of like okay is

2219
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:01,679
there a kind of practical example of

2220
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:03,719
that in real time and one of the things

2221
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:05,639
that I thought about was hey what about

2222
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:07,800
Cambridge analytica I mean there was a

2223
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,480
huge scandal with them they had access

2224
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:12,719
to a huge amount of data you're able to

2225
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:16,199
Target people with like immense accuracy

2226
02:09:16,199 --> 02:09:18,179
when you're on a platform like Facebook

2227
02:09:18,179 --> 02:09:20,880
and if you have people who are not

2228
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,280
capable of critical thoughts or checking

2229
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:26,699
information fact checking uh you

2230
02:09:26,699 --> 02:09:29,460
definitely are able to manipulate

2231
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:31,920
um how people how people think how

2232
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,360
people feel and how they're going to

2233
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,679
vote and how they're going to conduct

2234
02:09:34,679 --> 02:09:36,719
themselves and I mean Cambridge

2235
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:39,300
analytica was a self-described global

2236
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:42,360
election management agency like

2237
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,300
it's even in like their description

2238
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:45,920
um

2239
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,540
so I'm not the only person thinking

2240
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:49,800
about this

2241
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:53,580
um there is a a organization called

2242
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:55,440
represents us it's probably like

2243
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,420
represent us as well

2244
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:59,760
um and this is one of the most high

2245
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,699
quality uh convincing political deep

2246
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:05,159
fakes I have seen

2247
02:10:05,159 --> 02:10:09,679
um with quite a like a powerful message

2248
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:18,000
you want

2249
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,639
the election pairs Regional democracy

2250
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:26,599
I don't have to do anything

2251
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,840
people are divided

2252
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:33,840
reporting these tweets are unrelated

2253
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,840
locations

2254
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:45,119
it's not hard for democracy to collapse

2255
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:48,559
what do you have to do

2256
02:10:50,219 --> 02:10:53,239
thank you

2257
02:11:00,599 --> 02:11:03,420
all right so uh I don't spend a lot of

2258
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,239
time looking at defense because like I

2259
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:07,920
enjoy the offensive side of things but I

2260
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,780
thought I would just touch on it

2261
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:12,480
um of course you know there's going to

2262
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:14,699
be two sides to every coin so as much as

2263
02:11:14,699 --> 02:11:16,440
there are people creating deep fakes and

2264
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,480
seeing how much better can they get and

2265
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,520
how convincing can it be there's equally

2266
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,900
going to be people who's saying well

2267
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,760
this is clearly a problem we're going to

2268
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,800
need mechanisms to be able to at least

2269
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:28,020
detect and maybe tell people that what

2270
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:30,840
they're watching is not real

2271
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,420
um one of the ways that I came across

2272
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,659
during the research for this is that

2273
02:11:36,659 --> 02:11:39,420
combination and comparison of the vazims

2274
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,639
and the phonemes so is there something

2275
02:11:41,639 --> 02:11:43,619
in a deep fake video where the mouth is

2276
02:11:43,619 --> 02:11:45,300
moving in a way that doesn't match the

2277
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:47,699
sound to me I don't feel like that's

2278
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,860
going to age very well because I think

2279
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:51,840
that the better these things get the

2280
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:54,179
harder it's going to be to detect those

2281
02:11:54,179 --> 02:11:57,719
kind of um inconsistencies and like

2282
02:11:57,719 --> 02:11:59,820
anything in this industry it's a cat and

2283
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:02,159
mouse game whatever the defense come up

2284
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:03,900
with you know the offensive guys are

2285
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:06,239
going to be like cool story uh we're now

2286
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:07,860
going to find something to you know

2287
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:10,020
bypass that and so the cycle starts

2288
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:12,119
again and

2289
02:12:12,119 --> 02:12:13,800
um

2290
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,239
I'm now

2291
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:17,639
happy to answer any questions that you

2292
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:20,119
may have

2293
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:40,159
no there's a question here

2294
02:12:47,099 --> 02:12:49,380
um thanks very much for the talk it's

2295
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:51,360
completely out of my domain so it's been

2296
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,099
very interesting to listen to

2297
02:12:53,099 --> 02:12:53,880
listen to

2298
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:55,739
um the bit that you skipped over the

2299
02:12:55,739 --> 02:12:57,480
most because it's clearly not your area

2300
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,280
of interest to provide the tickled me so

2301
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:01,020
perhaps there's a nice little

2302
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:03,060
dialectical play

2303
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:04,260
um

2304
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:06,420
for me I can't plug myself into the

2305
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:08,880
motive of wanting to build a fence of

2306
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:11,760
deep hacks so ugly fakes so I'd be

2307
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,260
really curious to hear from you like

2308
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:15,060
what is it about it that excites you

2309
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:17,099
that makes you want to build them but

2310
02:13:17,099 --> 02:13:19,860
what are you getting out of it

2311
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:21,599
um I think it's just out of curiosity

2312
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:24,480
like you know as I said I used very like

2313
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,460
simple mechanisms to build this and if I

2314
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:28,500
can do it we'll really so can anyone

2315
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:29,520
else

2316
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,659
um and one of the things I thought about

2317
02:13:30,659 --> 02:13:32,760
is I mean I'm sure everyone here has or

2318
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:35,040
uses WhatsApp and you've seen that thing

2319
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,800
forwarded many times right uh if someone

2320
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:40,199
can create something that's convincing

2321
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:42,900
enough and they can then disseminate it

2322
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,119
and enough people believe it

2323
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:47,340
it's that's really because you're not

2324
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:49,139
you're now not just hacking some kind of

2325
02:13:49,139 --> 02:13:50,880
software or some operating system you're

2326
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:53,159
not hacking people and to me that's

2327
02:13:53,159 --> 02:13:56,839
quite that's got a powerful impact

2328
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:03,000
exactly exactly so you know with that

2329
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,340
forwarding you lose the quality you know

2330
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,800
those things are forgivable uh you'll

2331
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,420
kind of write them off subconsciously of

2332
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:10,800
like oh you know it's just some kind of

2333
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,300
glitch or something like that you're not

2334
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:14,219
necessarily going to think immediately

2335
02:14:14,219 --> 02:14:16,560
maybe this maybe this is a deep fake a

2336
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:17,940
lot of people won't even think they'll

2337
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,440
just blindly believe

2338
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:21,659
it was you know Cyril's saying it has to

2339
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:24,019
be true

2340
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:28,519
I mean we know better but

2341
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:39,780
it was really cool

2342
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,760
um I'm wondering aside from the

2343
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:44,219
political

2344
02:14:44,219 --> 02:14:45,780
aspect of this which is very interesting

2345
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:48,540
and scary in other ways

2346
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:52,380
um how about the more just uh prosaic

2347
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:55,500
you know information security side of it

2348
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,020
so um you know we were relying

2349
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,320
increasingly on

2350
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,840
[Music]

2351
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:03,960
uh like biometric authentication so you

2352
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,219
know people are trying to make things

2353
02:15:05,219 --> 02:15:06,719
more secure so there's moves towards

2354
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,400
things like you know all kinds of act

2355
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,440
these days are

2356
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,060
um they're using like Biometrics and

2357
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:14,699
videos to authenticate people and have

2358
02:15:14,699 --> 02:15:15,599
four

2359
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:19,739
a link back to class and all that stuff

2360
02:15:19,739 --> 02:15:20,460
um

2361
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:22,079
and while that is a step in the right

2362
02:15:22,079 --> 02:15:23,340
direction it almost seems like you know

2363
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,020
the Deep back technology is catching up

2364
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,880
even faster than

2365
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,260
um you know those Technologies are being

2366
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:30,659
adopted so we're at a point where like

2367
02:15:30,659 --> 02:15:33,780
anyone could just keep fake to you know

2368
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:36,360
or pick up themselves as someone else

2369
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,699
into identity theft or you know again

2370
02:15:38,699 --> 02:15:42,000
accessible bank accounts or

2371
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,280
you know we're increasingly doing things

2372
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:46,980
over teleconferencing we could

2373
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:48,480
you know have all my meetings and just

2374
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,639
impersonate someone

2375
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:52,920
um yeah what are you with your thoughts

2376
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:55,679
on that definitely so

2377
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:57,480
um two two ways I'm going to answer a

2378
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:59,579
question the first is I was lucky enough

2379
02:15:59,579 --> 02:16:01,920
to be part of a 10 a pen test where we

2380
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,619
tested that authentication where I'm

2381
02:16:04,619 --> 02:16:07,139
sure you've anyone's seen it you trying

2382
02:16:07,139 --> 02:16:08,579
to set something up in your Banking and

2383
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:09,780
it comes up with the screen it's like

2384
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,820
put your face in the oval and then it

2385
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:14,040
goes a bunch of colors so that's doing a

2386
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:16,500
liveness test exactly what's happening

2387
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,480
on the back end I would be lying if I

2388
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,520
told you I knew but there is something

2389
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,860
there that would prevent it from just

2390
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,540
you know facing that camera at a screen

2391
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:27,780
and being able to fool it I think that

2392
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:29,400
it's a bit more sophisticated than that

2393
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:32,820
for now at least so from that

2394
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:34,920
perspective I think we're but for now

2395
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,959
like we're okay like I don't know if

2396
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:39,000
it's going to stay that way

2397
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,679
um the talk that I did two years ago

2398
02:16:40,679 --> 02:16:43,920
actually focused I won't say exclusively

2399
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,718
but it definitely focused on exactly the

2400
02:16:45,718 --> 02:16:47,660
second part of your question like

2401
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:50,879
impersonating someone in a meeting

2402
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:53,099
um this is the thing is that there's and

2403
02:16:53,099 --> 02:16:54,898
as you saw with that Simon Cowell Elvis

2404
02:16:54,898 --> 02:16:56,760
video is that there's been significant

2405
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:59,040
improvements with uh being able to

2406
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,200
superimpose or superimpose a face in

2407
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,179
real time people are battling to do that

2408
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:05,459
with voice that seems to be lagging

2409
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:07,260
behind but I think once people get it

2410
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:09,359
right reliably and you can do it in real

2411
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:11,218
time it's it's going to be a show

2412
02:17:11,218 --> 02:17:13,138
to be honest

2413
02:17:13,138 --> 02:17:16,200
um and I think that it's definitely a

2414
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:19,080
vulnerability and if you are interested

2415
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:21,420
I did speak about this quite a bit in in

2416
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:24,000
my talk you can find it on my website

2417
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,459
um and yes so South African Banks use

2418
02:17:26,459 --> 02:17:29,160
voice authentication as a means of

2419
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:31,740
authenticating yourself when you call

2420
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:33,840
through to the call center so it's in my

2421
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,540
opinion it's definitely a problem

2422
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:38,459
and sometimes it happens like without

2423
02:17:38,459 --> 02:17:43,200
you uh granting like uh what is the word

2424
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,019
consent for them to use your voice as a

2425
02:17:46,019 --> 02:17:49,099
authentication means

2426
02:17:51,058 --> 02:17:54,058
sure

2427
02:17:54,179 --> 02:17:55,920
two questions the first one is have you

2428
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:58,439
seen the TV series The capture

2429
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:00,379
sorry the

2430
02:18:00,379 --> 02:18:02,519
capture no

2431
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:06,058
I didn't learn much okay

2432
02:18:06,058 --> 02:18:09,478
positioning so if you value to look at

2433
02:18:09,478 --> 02:18:11,939
the intouse lines of their real kind of

2434
02:18:11,939 --> 02:18:14,879
protection of the fights I have not but

2435
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:17,580
I mean this is such a huge topic when I

2436
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:19,320
started looking into this a couple years

2437
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:21,540
ago I kind of thought it was going to be

2438
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:23,939
a bit not I mean it's insulting to say

2439
02:18:23,939 --> 02:18:26,638
easy but I didn't think it was small I

2440
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:28,260
just didn't realize

2441
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:31,260
um how big this is and how many aspects

2442
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:33,058
there are to it so I appreciate people

2443
02:18:33,058 --> 02:18:34,920
in Q A's telling me about things that I

2444
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:38,218
hadn't seen or wasn't aware of

2445
02:18:38,218 --> 02:18:39,660
um there was a question in the front

2446
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:41,580
chair

2447
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:44,359
as well

2448
02:18:55,558 --> 02:18:57,718
I was just thinking that

2449
02:18:57,718 --> 02:18:59,718
um

2450
02:19:04,138 --> 02:19:06,120
and it seems to me that we need some

2451
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,218
sort of Auditors of the truth

2452
02:19:08,218 --> 02:19:11,058
facebook.com

2453
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:14,398
and it's also resulted in

2454
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:17,099
classifying things of disinformation

2455
02:19:17,099 --> 02:19:19,080
interestingly that the Covenant lab

2456
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,959
being hypothesis was

2457
02:19:21,959 --> 02:19:24,179
then it was determined at the highest

2458
02:19:24,179 --> 02:19:25,799
official levels of U.S government that

2459
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:28,679
it might be true

2460
02:19:28,679 --> 02:19:30,240
and then you were allowed to discuss it

2461
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,978
on Facebook

2462
02:19:31,978 --> 02:19:33,420
and I think this kind of thing inspires

2463
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:35,780
confidence

2464
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:41,638
at the time of

2465
02:19:41,638 --> 02:19:43,799
the time that went on

2466
02:19:43,799 --> 02:19:45,959
and sometimes also in politics reality

2467
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:47,638
Australian fiction we had very strange

2468
02:19:47,638 --> 02:19:49,380
developments you know people like Boris

2469
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:50,939
Johnson and Donald Trump very comical

2470
02:19:50,939 --> 02:19:53,820
figures we would say really

2471
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:53,880
really

2472
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:55,920
[Music]

2473
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,700
not the insurance

2474
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,640
and uh so I mean where am I going with

2475
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,320
this I'll just think they're deep to the

2476
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:06,359
philosophical problems

2477
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:07,500
and maybe actually it's going to come

2478
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,000
back to Mexico we all need to be the

2479
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,320
ones to

2480
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:13,020
decide like okay this is an interesting

2481
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:15,180
people you know this information is

2482
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:19,380
likely false selected exactly

2483
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,899
yeah exactly I mean and like how do you

2484
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:24,479
do that so I'm potentially asking the

2485
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:25,740
question that I don't even have an

2486
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:27,660
answer to like so a lot of these

2487
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,100
developments are taking place they're

2488
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:30,359
getting quite sophisticated they're

2489
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:33,060
improving all the time who's policing

2490
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:34,680
that who's saying all right well this is

2491
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:36,359
it's okay to do this and it's not okay

2492
02:20:36,359 --> 02:20:38,100
to do that and how do we tell people

2493
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:40,319
like there's no template there's no

2494
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:42,240
format like how do we tell people what

2495
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:45,319
they're seeing isn't real

2496
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:49,380
so so maybe just an interesting aside I

2497
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:51,420
don't know if you saw open ai's latest

2498
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:56,460
releases but if you ask the text

2499
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:59,580
generating AI for code if you actually

2500
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:01,740
cause a cross-site scripting it'll tell

2501
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:04,140
you it's doing that so the bigger

2502
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:06,359
question there is how do we classify

2503
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:08,340
things and we get to decide that so I

2504
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:09,600
think we're going to start seeing that

2505
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:13,020
especially it's a thing called Avatar

2506
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:16,080
dot AI where you can just upload a

2507
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:17,819
couple of photos of you and we'll make

2508
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:21,439
these beautiful photos of you yeah

2509
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:26,700
totally

2510
02:21:33,859 --> 02:21:35,880
so on that note just while you're

2511
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:37,319
walking there there's a website called

2512
02:21:37,319 --> 02:21:40,260
this person does not exist.com

2513
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:42,359
um and it's exactly what it says in the

2514
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:44,399
URL so every time you refresh the page

2515
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:46,920
it generates a fake person so if you

2516
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:48,780
want to set up some kind of you know

2517
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:51,359
ocean profiles whatever you want to do a

2518
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:53,340
good place to start

2519
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:56,460
uh how do you think we could detect a

2520
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:57,620
defect

2521
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:00,899
honestly just with your own eyes

2522
02:22:00,899 --> 02:22:03,660
um there will be giveaways like uh in

2523
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:05,760
that initial Tom Cruise video that I

2524
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:07,319
showed you there's one frame where his

2525
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:09,479
face kind of like looks too big I don't

2526
02:22:09,479 --> 02:22:10,680
know if anyone picked up on that

2527
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:12,899
there'll be like weird glitches like

2528
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:15,240
with the way his face kind of moves and

2529
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:17,040
you know the first time you watch it

2530
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:18,960
you're like huh you know Tom Cruise and

2531
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,819
Paris Hilton what is going on here and

2532
02:22:20,819 --> 02:22:21,960
you watch it again and you're like

2533
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,640
something just something just doesn't

2534
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:25,560
feel right like whenever I've given a

2535
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:27,060
talk or whenever I've spoken to people

2536
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:29,819
about security awareness uh it's just

2537
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:32,220
trust your gut that's literally don't

2538
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,200
like there will be tools and they will

2539
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:36,240
improve and they'll hopefully be able to

2540
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:37,520
tell us that these things aren't real

2541
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:40,500
but your gut instincts is generally the

2542
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:43,819
best thing to rely on

2543
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:46,439
thank you very much thank you so just

2544
02:22:46,439 --> 02:22:49,680
quickly the next talk is quarter past 11

2545
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,380
so there's 12 minutes for that

2546
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:55,680
being the same for track two and then

2547
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:58,800
also a little detaine's house and

2548
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,620
workshop will also start over the past

2549
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:05,939
11 and then lunch should be around 12

2550
02:23:05,939 --> 02:23:08,280
ish and that's on the first floor where

2551
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:10,620
the coffee and stuff that's just a

2552
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:14,399
general announcements and the straw

2553
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:17,880
seats can be organizer uh pause the way

2554
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:19,680
a while back so we've got a kind of

2555
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,020
Memorial book at the registration area

2556
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,399
if you want to write something about

2557
02:23:23,399 --> 02:23:25,439
them we also have the Instax camera if

2558
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:26,760
you want to take a photo because my

2559
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:30,359
incentives only because he was quite um

2560
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:33,780
in this up toll we lost them so we just

2561
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,880
want to leave them memory lasting memory

2562
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:37,500
because it's all just volunteer time

2563
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:40,140
that we do this so yeah we'll see you

2564
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:43,399
back at quarter past living

2565
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:51,250
[Applause]

2566
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,399
terrifying scary yeah

2567
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
um

2568
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:10,580
yeah

2569
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,979
thank you

2570
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:24,899
I didn't so

2571
02:24:24,899 --> 02:24:26,220
um the only thing I played was the

2572
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:28,920
Barack Obama for my mom and she's like

2573
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,359
that doesn't sound like Obama and

2574
02:24:30,359 --> 02:24:32,939
basically popped my bubble

2575
02:24:32,939 --> 02:24:36,300
um but uh I think I did show my

2576
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:37,800
boyfriend is sitting there and my mum

2577
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:39,540
Rudy

2578
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:41,640
believable did you think that video of

2579
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:44,240
Cyril was

2580
02:24:45,479 --> 02:24:48,619
to show you the video

2581
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,280
um

2582
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,819
I don't want to get arrested like I

2583
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:28,680
don't know the legality of like messing

2584
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:32,180
with the president I really don't

2585
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:40,920
you know the thing is you kind of want

2586
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:43,920
like you want a reaction right so you go

2587
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,819
for the top

2588
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:08,060
hence the disclaimer yeah

2589
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:28,939

laughs

2591
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:10,039
it's true

2592
02:28:31,740 --> 02:28:34,220
together

2593

why

2610
02:35:20,300 --> 02:35:23,660
that was great

2611
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:04,640
I think he's

2612
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:10,939
foreign

2613
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:04,220
it's like

2614
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:26,000
I mean I can probably switch the screen

2615
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:38,399

2617

streaming slash audio guy and then we'll

2618
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:44,840
start

2619
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:57,080
I don't even wear one

2620
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:01,760
oh wait my smart watch

2621
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:39,080
cool

2622
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:44,340
hi uh hi thanks for coming to my talk

2623
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:47,399
for those of you who can't read it's

2624
02:38:47,399 --> 02:38:49,500
called Smartwatch lobotomy

2625
02:38:49,500 --> 02:38:50,520
um

2626
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:54,000
taking a cheap Smartwatch and uh making

2627
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,620
it do what I want

2628
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:57,780
for those who don't know who I am I'm

2629
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:58,680
Dale

2630
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:01,979
I work my day job is I'm a senior

2631
02:39:01,979 --> 02:39:03,420
software developer at a company called

2632
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:07,040
structure it we build a software for

2633
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:09,780
structured markets and stuff like that

2634
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:13,560
um but in all honesty my hobby is in my

2635
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:14,819
free time I take things apart

2636
02:39:14,819 --> 02:39:16,680
occasionally if they go back together

2637
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:18,780
not always

2638
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:20,640
um I jokingly refer to myself as a jack

2639
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:23,520
of all trades serial skill collector and

2640
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,979
you'll see what I mean in a sec and a

2641
02:39:25,979 --> 02:39:28,140
high functioning hoarder I'm not sure

2642
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:29,880
about the high functioning part but I'm

2643
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:31,859
definitely a hoarder

2644
02:39:31,859 --> 02:39:34,700
so

2645
02:39:34,859 --> 02:39:37,620
this is the goal when I started all this

2646
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:40,620
it was um grab a watch and get it

2647
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:43,500
running my code uh that was how this

2648
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:45,000
started

2649
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,580
things never go according to plan so the

2650
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:50,280
it's now become make the cheap watch do

2651
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:53,880
what I want by any means necessary

2652
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:56,220
I mean how

2653
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:58,859
hot this started about four months ago

2654
02:39:58,859 --> 02:40:00,960
maybe longer

2655
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,600
um and you'll see

2656
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:06,180
so this is the cheap watch it's called a

2657
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:10,140
Focus fit Pro y68 it's also called the

2658
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,479
Smartwatch y68 it's also called the

2659
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:14,640
smart Fitness tracker y68 you'll notice

2660
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:18,840
a pattern the D20 y68 Smartwatch the y68

2661
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:22,560
macaron color Smartwatch the y68

2662
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:23,760
smartwatch

2663
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:26,220
and then my personal favorite the yitz

2664
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:30,000
68 Smartwatch and trust me after four

2665
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,380
months that's what I wanted to do with

2666
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,580
them

2667
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:35,760
um the watch cost between 100 and 200

2668
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:39,180
Rand or about two to four McDonald's Big

2669
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:40,680
Mac burgers for those of you who don't

2670
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,479
speak Rands

2671
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:44,960
um they're available locally on takealot

2672
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:47,340
these all appear to be the same watch I

2673
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:49,620
haven't bought all of them it gets

2674
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:51,720
expensive at the moment or at least

2675
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:53,700
during Black Friday they started off at

2676
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:56,760
159 Rand to watch you'll notice a

2677
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:59,880
pattern year they go 199 299

2678
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:02,780
um then it goes

2679
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:05,640
355.99 and 6.99

2680
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:07,160
um you can't see it but the bit that's

2681
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:10,500
scratched out says 999 Rand obviously

2682
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,300
it's take a lot they probably always

2683
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:15,720
cost 6.99 or 650 the week before they

2684
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:17,399
went on special but

2685
02:41:17,399 --> 02:41:20,100
this is as far as I can tell the same

2686
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:23,340
Swatch you can also buy it on AliExpress

2687
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:25,200
and places like that for somewhere

2688
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:29,580
between about three and six dollars if

2689
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:31,080
you buy enough of them you can get the

2690
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:33,240
price down to about two dollars

2691
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:35,220
um I can't convince my wife to let me

2692
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:37,260
buy 2 000 smart watches I'm also not

2693
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:40,260
sure what I'm gonna do with all of them

2694
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:42,060
um always remember when doing this thing

2695
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:47,539
two years one and one is none and whoa

2696
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,380
that was fun

2697
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:51,780
yeah

2698
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:52,920
okay

2699
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:56,340
let's get back there quick so uh by six

2700
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:58,200
uh don't tell my wife

2701
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:00,479
don't worry they weren't that expensive

2702
02:42:00,479 --> 02:42:03,600
honey so what happens is the first one I

2703
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:06,359
bought was about 199 Rand the second one

2704
02:42:06,359 --> 02:42:08,399
worked out about 150 Rand from takealot

2705
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:11,040
then one day only had this deal where

2706
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:14,340
you could get two for 150 Rand and then

2707
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:15,720
they had another deal a while later

2708
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:18,960
where you could get two for 200 Rand

2709
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:21,660
um I kept buying them

2710
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:24,960
it was a good idea uh no plan ever

2711
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:27,060
survives first contact with the Enemy or

2712
02:42:27,060 --> 02:42:29,399
cheap electronics um I killed three of

2713
02:42:29,399 --> 02:42:31,800
them so far there's probably going to be

2714
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:32,880
more

2715
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,260
um but it's the price you pay for a good

2716
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:36,060
B size talk

2717
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:38,520
this is the claimed specs

2718
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:41,880
um you'll see what I mean so uh it's a

2719
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:45,180
1.3 inch IPS screen it's a little LCD

2720
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:49,020
screen they claim it's IP67 waterproof

2721
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:53,819
um the chipset is this H whatever is s

2722
02:42:53,819 --> 02:42:55,740
um battery capacity is 150 milliamp

2723
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:56,640
hours

2724
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:58,080
um they claim it's got a heart rate

2725
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:02,220
detection uh its standby is 10 days

2726
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:04,859
and it takes two hours to charge

2727
02:43:04,859 --> 02:43:07,859
um playing around that's the actual

2728
02:43:07,859 --> 02:43:10,740
specs yes it does have a screen

2729
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,300
um

2730
02:43:12,300 --> 02:43:14,520
honestly I wouldn't wash my I wouldn't

2731
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:16,260
even wash my hands with wearing one of

2732
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,760
these watches I'm not sure I'd take it

2733
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:20,040
close to the bathroom I wouldn't drink a

2734
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:21,420
cup of coffee wearing one of these

2735
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:24,420
watches they are not waterproof they are

2736
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:26,520
not anything it's a couple of bits of

2737
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:28,740
plastic clipped together if you're going

2738
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:30,479
to read on takealot you'll notice that

2739
02:43:30,479 --> 02:43:32,520
some of the specs for this watch include

2740
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:36,359
a aluminum anodized housing no there's

2741
02:43:36,359 --> 02:43:38,939
no metal where's ever came near this

2742
02:43:38,939 --> 02:43:40,560
watch

2743
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:43,640
um the chipset is actually a TLS

2744
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:46,920
r8323 which was a surprise when I bought

2745
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,479
the watch thinking it had the other

2746
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:51,359
chipset because that one is partially

2747
02:43:51,359 --> 02:43:54,300
easily hackable this one not so much

2748
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:56,340
um the battery capacity varies I've had

2749
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:58,319
these watches open the printing on the

2750
02:43:58,319 --> 02:44:01,200
actual battery varies between

2751
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:04,319
different watches that claim to be the

2752
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:07,260
same model I don't know so um one of the

2753
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:10,080
brands was ntec any Tech something like

2754
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:12,479
that and the one watch had 100 milliamp

2755
02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:14,520
hour battery the other one had 150

2756
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:17,160
milliamp hour battery that's from the

2757
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:19,439
same thing same box everything else

2758
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:22,560
um heart rate just remember the little X

2759
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:24,080
we'll come to that

2760
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:29,040
standby time it varies if you happen to

2761
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:32,720
have paired with a cell phone

2762
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:36,180
then the the standby time drops

2763
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:37,800
drastically

2764
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,359
um it also

2765
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:41,760
it depends if you happen to be wearing

2766
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:45,240
the watch the it also varies a lot um if

2767
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,920
you put it into your draw and don't

2768
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:49,260
touch it or leave it on a desk you might

2769
02:44:49,260 --> 02:44:51,240
get three hours again it depends on

2770
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,100
which one of the watch I have six of

2771
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:55,920
them one of them makes four days one of

2772
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,859
them barely lost 30 minutes uh the

2773
02:44:58,859 --> 02:45:00,780
charging time I think they're correct I

2774
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:02,220
haven't timed it but it seems to be

2775
02:45:02,220 --> 02:45:04,140
about two hours I don't trust these

2776
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,280
things I'm not going to leave it on

2777
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:07,800
charge overnight

2778
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:10,020
um so it's available in Many Colors I

2779
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:11,760
don't have the pink one that one sold

2780
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:13,859
out incredibly quickly that's also

2781
02:45:13,859 --> 02:45:16,260
because the pink one is 20 round cheaper

2782
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:18,540
than the other watches uh the most

2783
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:21,359
expensive model is the middle one which

2784
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:23,819
they claim is white uh what it actually

2785
02:45:23,819 --> 02:45:26,880
is is black plastic spray painted silver

2786
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:30,720
and comes with a white watch band

2787
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:33,720
um charging on this thing is uh

2788
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:37,439
interesting you pull off

2789
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:40,020
the watch band Clips onto the watch It's

2790
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:43,140
You Yank It Off and then it exposes that

2791
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:46,319
thing that connector you shove

2792
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:50,040
into a USB socket

2793
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,859
um now you know you always get USB the

2794
02:45:52,859 --> 02:45:54,300
wrong way around the first three you

2795
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:55,740
know it takes three tries to get it the

2796
02:45:55,740 --> 02:45:57,060
right way around this one's even worse

2797
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:58,140
because you can put it in the right

2798
02:45:58,140 --> 02:45:59,460
wrong way around and your watch just

2799
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:01,680
won't it won't start charging if it's

2800
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:03,660
completely flat you won't know it's not

2801
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:05,040
charging because it doesn't do anything

2802
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,660
until about half an hour into the

2803
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:09,260
charging process

2804
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:14,340
most laptops and computers because it

2805
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:16,439
can't go far enough into the USB slot to

2806
02:46:16,439 --> 02:46:18,960
make decent contact and even once you do

2807
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,640
get it in some of the watches are

2808
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:22,740
slightly Slimmer which means that they

2809
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:24,180
don't make proper contact when you bump

2810
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:27,060
them they stop charging like I say I

2811
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:28,800
want to throw it out the window

2812
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,140
um the actual Hardware this is just the

2813
02:46:31,140 --> 02:46:33,540
info screen on the watch itself

2814
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:35,700
um there is the model number you'll see

2815
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:41,060
there's no mention of y68 it's the

2816
02:46:41,060 --> 02:46:44,100
lt716g some of the watches I have don't

2817
02:46:44,100 --> 02:46:46,260
have the G I don't know what GE stands

2818
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:49,800
for the software version yeah and the

2819
02:46:49,800 --> 02:46:53,399
Bluetooth name is lt716

2820
02:46:53,399 --> 02:46:55,800
the next string there is part of the MAC

2821
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:57,660
address this becomes really useful when

2822
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,100
you have a lot of them on your desk and

2823
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:00,479
you're not sure which one you're busy

2824
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:02,880
poking at and I have no idea what those

2825
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:04,439
numbers mean one day we'll figure them

2826
02:47:04,439 --> 02:47:05,340
out

2827
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:08,460
that's the outside of the watch and

2828
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:10,800
um the on the left hand side you'll note

2829
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:12,960
that's the front on the other side of

2830
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:15,060
the underside of it that's got the heart

2831
02:47:15,060 --> 02:47:16,680
rate sensor

2832
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:17,700
um

2833
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:19,740
opening this watch is pretty easy all

2834
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:22,800
you need is a flat spludgy thing and you

2835
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:25,080
just pop the plastic cover off

2836
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:27,840
if you want to do it without mocking

2837
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,120
anything I suggest your prying tool be

2838
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:32,160
plastic any of those cheap kits you can

2839
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,740
buy from you know take a lighter

2840
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:36,420
wherever for 50 bucks it comes with the

2841
02:47:36,420 --> 02:47:38,700
prying tool those work great uh to be

2842
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:40,140
honest I can care and just grab whatever

2843
02:47:40,140 --> 02:47:42,540
was on my desk and pride the thing off

2844
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:44,640
um there's no gaskets there's no proper

2845
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:45,960
ceiling there's no nothing and that's

2846
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:47,700
why I say if water gets into this it's

2847
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:49,160
the end

2848
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:52,080
so on the left on the top photo you can

2849
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:54,660
see the screen sort of wedged off to the

2850
02:47:54,660 --> 02:47:55,920
side that's the only part of the

2851
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:57,000
electronics you have to be really

2852
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,160
delicate with I killed my first smart

2853
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:00,840
watch by ripping off the screen by

2854
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:03,240
accident and once that Cable's torn

2855
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:06,060
there's not much you can do

2856
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:07,740
um that's the inside it's got a

2857
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:09,300
vibration motor which you can see it was

2858
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:11,760
that round a silver disc below that is

2859
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:14,040
the battery otherwise known as The Spicy

2860
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:17,580
pillow below those stuck in place with

2861
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:20,939
double-sided tape is a heart rate sensor

2862
02:48:20,939 --> 02:48:24,000
they claim uh on the left is the back of

2863
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,160
the PCB

2864
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:30,899
this is there's the special Flex PCB

2865
02:48:30,899 --> 02:48:33,840
that holds the heart rate sensor

2866
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:35,700
on the board itself it's got some

2867
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:37,260
interesting test points now if you're

2868
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:39,300
not used to taking things apart test

2869
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:41,520
points are um they're little places

2870
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:43,080
where generally they will probe the

2871
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:44,520
device to figure out what it's doing

2872
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:46,620
they use them during manufacturing for

2873
02:48:46,620 --> 02:48:48,840
programming they use it to debug them

2874
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:51,600
and things like that so these are the

2875
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:52,800
kind of things you look at if you're

2876
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:54,240
going to reverse engineer something or

2877
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:55,740
hack on advice you go and find them

2878
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:57,540
because generally they the interesting

2879
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:00,140
signals

2880
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:02,520
um this is just the PCB you can see the

2881
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:04,319
component size uh we'll get into that

2882
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:07,560
now so Hardware reverse engineering um

2883
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:09,420
this is my hobby I enjoy taking things

2884
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:11,460
apart and like I say I enjoy reverse

2885
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:13,859
engineering basically it's educated

2886
02:49:13,859 --> 02:49:17,399
guesswork don't listen to all it is is

2887
02:49:17,399 --> 02:49:19,620
you're taking a bunch of guesses

2888
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:21,420
occasionally you'll guess right most of

2889
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:22,740
the time you get wrong doesn't matter

2890
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:24,600
next time around you'll get better if

2891
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:26,280
you want to get good at this take lots

2892
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:27,380
of things apart

2893
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:29,760
you can if you can't afford to take

2894
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:31,500
things apart or you don't have space or

2895
02:49:31,500 --> 02:49:33,260
you've run out of space

2896
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:37,260
YouTube just putting tear down put in

2897
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:39,359
anything like that and you can watch

2898
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:41,280
other people take things apart that you

2899
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:43,500
would never be get access to everything

2900
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:45,660
from missile guidance systems to Russian

2901
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:48,720
computers to bits of soyuz capsule to

2902
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,939
Apollo guidance computers and there's

2903
02:49:50,939 --> 02:49:53,040
much postmoder people than I explaining

2904
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:54,960
in great detail how they work

2905
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:56,939
the more you do this the more you'll

2906
02:49:56,939 --> 02:49:59,760
recognize things and that's how reverse

2907
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,620
engineering works it's pattern

2908
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:03,420
recognition you see something and you go

2909
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:05,580
oh I've seen that before I know how that

2910
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:07,680
works or I have no idea what the editing

2911
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:10,080
is you figure it out later you store it

2912
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,640
in the back of your head and six months

2913
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:14,520
time when you see it again you now know

2914
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:17,939
so identifying components on a PCB is

2915
02:50:17,939 --> 02:50:20,040
relatively easy anything with three legs

2916
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:23,340
less it's not important the reason I say

2917
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:25,920
that is you need more than three legs

2918
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:29,160
because you've got power which is two

2919
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:31,800
two legs the third leg is not enough to

2920
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:33,420
get anything interesting in and out of

2921
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:35,460
the chip so don't worry about three legs

2922
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:38,220
or less once you to figure out what the

2923
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:40,620
parts do just Google them Bing them Duck

2924
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:42,720
Duck Go them if you still can't find

2925
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:46,020
them look on AliExpress or taobao or

2926
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:48,660
Alibaba just taobao you just use the

2927
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:49,979
Google Translate

2928
02:50:49,979 --> 02:50:52,500
all you're looking for is some vague

2929
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:54,420
idea of what the thing is once you know

2930
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:56,160
you can move on and guess the other

2931
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:57,300
parts

2932
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,880
for those of you who don't know Baidu is

2933
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:02,040
a Chinese search engine again Google

2934
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:04,800
translate you'll find things there that

2935
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:06,359
aren't anywhere else and that's

2936
02:51:06,359 --> 02:51:08,160
partially because China don't like the

2937
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:09,600
rest of the internet so they have their

2938
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:11,880
own little private one and Baidu is

2939
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:13,680
quite a nice way into that world like I

2940
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:15,200
say Google Translates and you'll be fine

2941
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:18,479
so identifying components this is

2942
02:51:18,479 --> 02:51:21,540
the fun bit that's the PCB as you can

2943
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:22,859
see I've highlighted all the various

2944
02:51:22,859 --> 02:51:24,420
bits and pieces

2945
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:26,640
uh these are all the three-legged

2946
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:27,960
components so these are all the

2947
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:29,520
uninteresting things

2948
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:33,840
um there's a smt SMD transistor the red

2949
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:36,899
one uh the orange one is also transistor

2950
02:51:36,899 --> 02:51:39,660
or a mosfet technically um it doesn't

2951
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:41,220
matter you can think of these things as

2952
02:51:41,220 --> 02:51:44,760
switchy things it really it's not gonna

2953
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:46,560
matter for the greater in the greatest

2954
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:49,020
scheme of things the last one is a

2955
02:51:49,020 --> 02:51:51,420
voltage regulator basically that powers

2956
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:52,560
things

2957
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:53,340
um

2958
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:55,979
now we get on to the interesting bits

2959
02:51:55,979 --> 02:51:59,700
so yeah we have the first one is the

2960
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:02,240
blue thing that the top

2961
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:05,460
that's a linear charge controller it

2962
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:07,439
manages the battery now the only reason

2963
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:09,060
I say this is gets interesting is

2964
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:09,960
because you're going to need to know

2965
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:12,060
this if you want to power the device if

2966
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:13,560
you want to check the battery levels and

2967
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:14,899
all this kind of thing

2968
02:52:14,899 --> 02:52:17,880
the yellow thing is a touch controller

2969
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:21,120
this device is really wacky it's only

2970
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:24,120
got one specific spot that you have to

2971
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,740
magically get your finger to align with

2972
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:28,020
to touch there's no touch screen there's

2973
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:29,340
none of that there's a tiny little

2974
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:31,080
circle at the bottom of the screen and

2975
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:32,460
you have to carefully line your finger

2976
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:34,140
up and when you touch it that is a touch

2977
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:36,300
the other option you have is hold your

2978
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:37,979
finger there for slightly longer and

2979
02:52:37,979 --> 02:52:39,240
that's the longer touch those are the

2980
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:41,040
only inputs on this device

2981
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:42,960
and um

2982
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:45,420
I say finger but it will also work

2983
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:47,520
anything else that triggers capacitive

2984
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:50,340
touch so the amount of times that you've

2985
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:51,720
sneezed near the thing and it suddenly

2986
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:55,080
decided I'm clicking tap touch thing

2987
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:57,660
five times and you on the wrong screen

2988
02:52:57,660 --> 02:52:59,580
the last one I'm guessing I can't find

2989
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,560
any documentation about this it's kind

2990
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,120
of hard when you only got four letters

2991
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:04,920
to guess what the thing is

2992
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:07,319
but based on what this watch does I'm

2993
02:53:07,319 --> 02:53:09,120
guessing it's an accelerometer or

2994
02:53:09,120 --> 02:53:11,460
inertial measurement unit or something

2995
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:13,859
vaguely like that basically this watch

2996
02:53:13,859 --> 02:53:15,720
counts steps so it needs some way to

2997
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:17,160
count steps I couldn't find anything

2998
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,319
else that looked like step counting

2999
02:53:19,319 --> 02:53:21,600
things so I'm guessing that's what it is

3000
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:24,620
it also happens to correspond to other

3001
02:53:24,620 --> 02:53:26,939
accelerometer chips so

3002
02:53:26,939 --> 02:53:28,859
I'm pretty good I'm pretty sure that's a

3003
02:53:28,859 --> 02:53:29,880
good guess

3004
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:32,819
then the most important part of this

3005
02:53:32,819 --> 02:53:36,120
thing is that chip this is a t-link TS

3006
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:39,120
tlsr8232

3007
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:42,180
that is the heart of this thing it's a

3008
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:43,979
system on chip it handles all the

3009
02:53:43,979 --> 02:53:46,859
Bluetooth and it basically controls

3010
02:53:46,859 --> 02:53:49,160
everything

3011
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:51,540
this is the

3012
02:53:51,540 --> 02:53:54,060
heart rate sensor

3013
02:53:54,060 --> 02:53:58,380
so on this PCB there's three things two

3014
02:53:58,380 --> 02:54:02,520
green LEDs and it's a resistor

3015
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:05,279
and I guess the giveaway yeah is the tag

3016
02:54:05,279 --> 02:54:07,260
the messaging the slot screen on the

3017
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:09,859
actual board Note it says

3018
02:54:09,859 --> 02:54:12,140
lt716 LED

3019
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:17,939
0603 FPC means um flexible PCB normally

3020
02:54:17,939 --> 02:54:20,340
no heart rate sensor but maybe they're

3021
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:21,899
doing something magical maybe we've

3022
02:54:21,899 --> 02:54:24,180
discovered that LEDs now can act as

3023
02:54:24,180 --> 02:54:26,100
heart rate sensors I mean it's possible

3024
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:29,520
you know no doubts and but I'm pretty

3025
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,560
sure that explains why my desk has a

3026
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:34,560
heart rate of 70 beats per minute

3027
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:36,359
um yeah this thing has no heart rate

3028
02:54:36,359 --> 02:54:39,060
sensor it's completely fake uh and it's

3029
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:41,880
pretty common a lot of these cheap ones

3030
02:54:41,880 --> 02:54:43,740
have fake heart rate sensors they they

3031
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:47,460
look the same as my Huawei or Samsung or

3032
02:54:47,460 --> 02:54:49,319
an Apple iPhone they're all blink

3033
02:54:49,319 --> 02:54:52,080
license fast it looks like a proper

3034
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:53,939
sensor it's not it's just a bunch of

3035
02:54:53,939 --> 02:54:56,279
LEDs and you'll quickly realize this put

3036
02:54:56,279 --> 02:54:58,080
one on after climbing stairs and it says

3037
02:54:58,080 --> 02:55:02,279
your heart rate it's 68 beats per minute

3038
02:55:02,279 --> 02:55:06,560
um or it will say your O2 levels are 99

3039
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:10,020
all the time consistently the best one

3040
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:12,180
is it's got at the bottom there that is

3041
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:13,979
your blood pressure now for those of you

3042
02:55:13,979 --> 02:55:15,420
who don't know you can't actually take

3043
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:17,520
blood pressure through a heart rate

3044
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:20,220
sensor there's glass of there's a whole

3045
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:22,680
paper about why you can't but basically

3046
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:24,540
it comes down to that's just a guess I

3047
02:55:24,540 --> 02:55:26,939
have high blood pressure so I know that

3048
02:55:26,939 --> 02:55:29,580
when I put it on the value is all way

3049
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:32,100
out of whack and it was the first hint

3050
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,899
that there's something questionable

3051
02:55:33,899 --> 02:55:37,200
about this device but hey it's 150 Rand

3052
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:40,500
watch what do you expect

3053
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:42,660
onto the test points these are all the

3054
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:43,979
interesting things

3055
02:55:43,979 --> 02:55:46,800
um so normally when you're hacking a

3056
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:50,100
router or something big with that runs

3057
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:51,720
Android or Linux or something like that

3058
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:53,160
on then you're looking for the serial

3059
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,260
ports on this device serial means

3060
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:57,660
nothing those points are just happen to

3061
02:55:57,660 --> 02:55:59,399
be wired into the serial pins of the

3062
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:00,479
chip but you can't actually do anything

3063
02:56:00,479 --> 02:56:02,760
with them I did check there's nothing

3064
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:05,520
coming out of them the BT one is just a

3065
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:06,960
link to the antenna I'm guessing that's

3066
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:09,300
for some sort of testing the v-bus one

3067
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:11,279
that I put their bus voltage that's

3068
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:14,580
actually the USB charge positive I

3069
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:16,200
figured out a while back

3070
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:19,380
the interesting points on the other side

3071
02:56:19,380 --> 02:56:22,319
um there's the T12 T15 that's just that

3072
02:56:22,319 --> 02:56:25,200
the single touch point

3073
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,420
um there's a 3.3 volt that's just a

3074
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:29,819
voltage there's a DAT pin which I have

3075
02:56:29,819 --> 02:56:31,979
no idea what it does I can't make it do

3076
02:56:31,979 --> 02:56:35,220
anything and then there's SWS which it

3077
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:37,439
turns out is a debug interface

3078
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:39,899
so this is the actual chip

3079
02:56:39,899 --> 02:56:42,120
um this is sort of a block diagram of

3080
02:56:42,120 --> 02:56:43,500
how it works and there's a couple of

3081
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:45,540
versions of this particular one t-link

3082
02:56:45,540 --> 02:56:47,220
is kind of interesting it turns out that

3083
02:56:47,220 --> 02:56:49,920
the chips are in all kinds of devices I

3084
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:52,560
happen to take a Gamepad a couple of

3085
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,720
days ago apart and in there is a chip

3086
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:56,819
made by a totally different company and

3087
02:56:56,819 --> 02:56:58,140
it turns out they license their

3088
02:56:58,140 --> 02:57:00,779
technology from t-link

3089
02:57:00,779 --> 02:57:01,640
um

3090
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:06,359
the chip has 16k of ram 512k of flash

3091
02:57:06,359 --> 02:57:09,060
this particular one in the watch runs at

3092
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:11,640
24 megahertz it's got a proprietary

3093
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:14,760
debug protocol because of course and

3094
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:16,439
it's instruction set that claims

3095
02:57:16,439 --> 02:57:19,319
proprietary it's a tc32

3096
02:57:19,319 --> 02:57:21,600
um it turns out it's essentially a clone

3097
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:24,960
of a 16-bit arm nine thumb instruction

3098
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:27,000
set with a few tweaks because you can't

3099
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,500
just clone things automatically you've

3100
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:29,779
got to add something

3101
02:57:29,779 --> 02:57:32,880
so the Sy debug interface this is what

3102
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:34,800
got me interested in this particular

3103
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:37,260
watch yes I do occasionally buy cheap

3104
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:40,200
electronics and take them apart so it's

3105
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:41,899
a proprietary interface

3106
02:57:41,899 --> 02:57:44,160
there is a programmer available it's

3107
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:46,500
only 400 Rand I am very very tempted to

3108
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:49,560
buy it the problem is the shipping to

3109
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:53,819
South Africa is over 750 Rand so it gets

3110
02:57:53,819 --> 02:57:56,399
pretty expensive for you know a toy or

3111
02:57:56,399 --> 02:57:59,340
potentially a b side to talk if I do get

3112
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:01,200
this into Defcon maybe I'll buy one who

3113
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:02,520
knows

3114
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:05,100
um there is an open source Syed debugger

3115
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:08,760
there's a Russian guy called Victor who

3116
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:11,100
on GitHub has released a open source

3117
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:12,420
programmer he's got a whole lot of

3118
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:15,540
details on it it's not exactly for this

3119
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,760
particular chip but people have said it

3120
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:20,460
works um and then there's another guy or

3121
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:23,100
another person Raphael who wrote a bunch

3122
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:24,600
of scripts that talks to their program

3123
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:26,819
and makes your life easier

3124
02:58:26,819 --> 02:58:28,979
so this is more or less what you have to

3125
02:58:28,979 --> 02:58:31,740
do you take your blue pearl board which

3126
02:58:31,740 --> 02:58:35,520
is a stm32 Dev board you load his fancy

3127
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:37,740
software onto that you wire a couple of

3128
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:41,399
wires onto the board you run the python

3129
02:58:41,399 --> 02:58:45,479
script and everything talks so there I'm

3130
02:58:45,479 --> 02:58:49,020
busy wiring it all up clean workbench

3131
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:51,960
um and you run it and then it crashes

3132
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:54,720
now at this point I'd already submitted

3133
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:57,899
to besides so I started panicking

3134
02:58:57,899 --> 02:59:01,200
um and yeah so it turns out it doesn't

3135
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:04,020
work the reason it doesn't work is

3136
02:59:04,020 --> 02:59:05,520
there's no reset pin for those of you

3137
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,140
who don't know what a reset but does

3138
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:09,120
it's the same as on your desktop machine

3139
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:11,399
if you hold down reset your computer is

3140
02:59:11,399 --> 02:59:15,060
on but not on what reset does is holds

3141
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:18,000
the CPU in a state where it's ready with

3142
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,260
all the power and everything else but

3143
02:59:19,260 --> 02:59:21,479
it's not executing any instructions then

3144
02:59:21,479 --> 02:59:23,100
the minute you let go the reset button

3145
02:59:23,100 --> 02:59:25,200
the computer suddenly bursts into life

3146
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:26,760
and the CPU starts executing

3147
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:29,460
instructions when you want to try and

3148
02:59:29,460 --> 02:59:32,160
program a microcontroller like this one

3149
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:34,140
you need the same thing you need to put

3150
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:36,240
it in this powered on state where it's

3151
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:38,279
sitting idle and then as soon as it

3152
02:59:38,279 --> 02:59:40,979
Powers up you Hammer the SWS pin in this

3153
02:59:40,979 --> 02:59:43,319
case and you say quick quick stop what

3154
02:59:43,319 --> 02:59:44,640
you're doing and do what I want you to

3155
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:47,040
do without the reset pin you have to do

3156
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:48,720
this other ways you have to either

3157
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:51,120
toggle the power which is a bit sketchy

3158
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:53,220
because things stay on but aren't on and

3159
02:59:53,220 --> 02:59:54,899
all this kind of stuff or you have to

3160
02:59:54,899 --> 02:59:56,880
find some other way to glitch it into

3161
02:59:56,880 --> 02:59:59,960
running this thing

3162
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:02,819
I uh tried this quite a bit I couldn't

3163
03:00:02,819 --> 03:00:05,520
get it right the other thing is the SWS

3164
03:00:05,520 --> 03:00:07,500
pins also used to control the hot

3165
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:09,660
monitor LEDs so you have to disconnect

3166
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:11,399
the hot monitor board there's still a

3167
03:00:11,399 --> 03:00:13,380
whole lot of components

3168
03:00:13,380 --> 03:00:14,880
um since writing these slides have

3169
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:16,800
discovered that there's a trace you can

3170
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:20,040
cut and you can tack a wire on and it

3171
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:22,200
seems to be a little bit better but

3172
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:24,420
basically the combination seems to mean

3173
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:27,180
I can't reliably Pro program this

3174
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:29,640
particular watch which kind of sucks

3175
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:31,560
but then

3176
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:32,939
when these kind of things happen you

3177
03:00:32,939 --> 03:00:35,220
take a little bit of a detour so let's

3178
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:37,319
talk about some Vikings um for those of

3179
03:00:37,319 --> 03:00:38,760
you don't know Bluetooth is named after

3180
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:41,640
a Viking and in this place it's called

3181
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:44,640
blo Bluetooth low energy

3182
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:47,460
on this particular watch Bluetooth is

3183
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:49,100
sketchy at best

3184
03:00:49,100 --> 03:00:52,260
it often just won't show up it won't

3185
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:54,120
connect it will tell you it's connected

3186
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:55,520
but not do anything

3187
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:58,319
if you flick through the screens really

3188
03:00:58,319 --> 03:01:00,120
fast and like I say sneeze on the watch

3189
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:03,359
so tap the button it will connect for a

3190
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:06,120
little while the official app solves

3191
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:09,899
this by caching and queuing that's all

3192
03:01:09,899 --> 03:01:11,520
they do they just cache everything so

3193
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:12,960
half the time the values you're looking

3194
03:01:12,960 --> 03:01:15,120
at in the app don't actually match the

3195
03:01:15,120 --> 03:01:18,060
watch and often when it finally connects

3196
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:19,380
it suddenly it just hammers the poor

3197
03:01:19,380 --> 03:01:20,700
watch with a whole lot of commands that

3198
03:01:20,700 --> 03:01:23,340
you clicked so if you've got a bunch of

3199
03:01:23,340 --> 03:01:24,899
notifications and your watch hasn't gone

3200
03:01:24,899 --> 03:01:27,060
off and then all of a sudden you know

3201
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:28,920
rings for the last 10 minutes while

3202
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:30,620
they're quickly all the notification

3203
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:33,420
notifications catch up

3204
03:01:33,420 --> 03:01:36,000
so when you want to explore Bluetooth

3205
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,520
low Energy Services there's a great app

3206
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:40,500
for Android I believe it's available for

3207
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:43,620
iPhone called NRF connect if you haven't

3208
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:46,080
used this app it's awesome it's made by

3209
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,760
Nordic it's actually for the Nordic

3210
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:50,580
chips but you can run it on it will

3211
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:52,620
connect to any bluetooth app yay

3212
03:01:52,620 --> 03:01:53,720
standards

3213
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:56,760
so this what's here is the various

3214
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:58,819
Bluetooth Services provided by the watch

3215
03:01:58,819 --> 03:02:01,979
now there are standards within ble so

3216
03:02:01,979 --> 03:02:04,979
device information and Battery Service

3217
03:02:04,979 --> 03:02:06,920
are normally

3218
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,939
consistent across the various devices

3219
03:02:08,939 --> 03:02:10,859
and the other ones are just added on

3220
03:02:10,859 --> 03:02:14,640
from manufacturer to manufacturer

3221
03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:15,960
um so what I'm going to do is we'll

3222
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:18,180
quickly look at the battery service one

3223
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:20,220
uh it's pretty easy you expand the

3224
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:21,779
little thing in the app and you say

3225
03:02:21,779 --> 03:02:23,160
download and then it gives you the

3226
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:24,899
battery level so you'll see on there it

3227
03:02:24,899 --> 03:02:27,420
says 100 at that time this battery was

3228
03:02:27,420 --> 03:02:29,220
fully charged

3229
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:32,160
um but you can also do it using get tool

3230
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:35,399
so basically the what I've got on the

3231
03:02:35,399 --> 03:02:37,200
screen here is a bunch of Linux commands

3232
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:39,660
um unfortunately there's no get tool for

3233
03:02:39,660 --> 03:02:42,720
Windows those are you on Mac OS there is

3234
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:47,399
for Macos Mac OS Max are special

3235
03:02:47,399 --> 03:02:50,160
and Bluetooth on them is extra special

3236
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:53,760
because Apple

3237
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:56,819
or privacy Advocates which means that

3238
03:02:56,819 --> 03:02:58,380
you don't get Mac addresses you get

3239
03:02:58,380 --> 03:03:01,020
funny uuid things and it just makes

3240
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:02,880
everything miserable but it's okay I

3241
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,760
can't afford new Macs so uh we'll stick

3242
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:06,960
to Linux

3243
03:03:06,960 --> 03:03:09,240
if you run Gat tool it will connect to

3244
03:03:09,240 --> 03:03:10,859
the watch or pull down the

3245
03:03:10,859 --> 03:03:13,080
um battery value as you can see there

3246
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:15,359
all that's information is the same as in

3247
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:18,180
the app it's just not as pretty

3248
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:19,740
you can do the same for the device

3249
03:03:19,740 --> 03:03:21,660
information screen you can connect to it

3250
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:23,220
via the app you can say give me your

3251
03:03:23,220 --> 03:03:24,960
information you'll see there there's the

3252
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:28,200
version firmware revision number and if

3253
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:29,580
you do it through the get tool you'll

3254
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:31,560
get it a string of hex values you

3255
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:34,560
convert those to ASCII and you'll see

3256
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:37,200
there's v03757

3257
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:41,040
it's very nice but kind of boring

3258
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,080
so there's now we get to the interesting

3259
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:45,359
bits so uh software reverse engineering

3260
03:03:45,359 --> 03:03:46,500
I don't know how many of you guys have

3261
03:03:46,500 --> 03:03:47,880
done this kind of thing

3262
03:03:47,880 --> 03:03:49,439
um this is

3263
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:52,260
a lot of fun you get your your Android

3264
03:03:52,260 --> 03:03:55,380
software so in my case I just Googled

3265
03:03:55,380 --> 03:03:58,439
the official app called fit Pro grab the

3266
03:03:58,439 --> 03:04:01,319
first APK I found where you find it what

3267
03:04:01,319 --> 03:04:02,819
which one it is doesn't matter too much

3268
03:04:02,819 --> 03:04:05,160
you just need a newish one

3269
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:07,680
um and then you install this program for

3270
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:10,020
those of you who don't know it's a Java

3271
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:14,939
a APK D compiler so all I have to do is

3272
03:04:14,939 --> 03:04:16,979
take my Android app dump it into this

3273
03:04:16,979 --> 03:04:20,160
and I get Java code out

3274
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:22,740
it's one of the things that makes

3275
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:24,600
um decompiling or messing with Android

3276
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:26,540
apps a lot of fun and really really easy

3277
03:04:26,540 --> 03:04:28,979
you can do some of the things on.net and

3278
03:04:28,979 --> 03:04:31,200
that but all the uh the interpret well

3279
03:04:31,200 --> 03:04:34,080
not interpret the these um one languages

3280
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:35,880
like this with a bytecode that use

3281
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:38,580
bytecode uh this works quite well with

3282
03:04:38,580 --> 03:04:42,720
um the actual jedx tool has come a long

3283
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:44,880
way since the last time I used it uh you

3284
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:46,920
can click around and find all the stuff

3285
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:49,740
and do fine using and all the things you

3286
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:51,720
used to in your common IDE all in there

3287
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:55,200
one Java app you do need lots of memory

3288
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:56,300
though it

3289
03:04:56,300 --> 03:04:59,580
this particular APK is about 100 Megs

3290
03:04:59,580 --> 03:05:01,620
depending on which version you got and

3291
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:03,600
when you see all the code in there you

3292
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:06,000
suddenly realize why they've the app

3293
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,100
itself talks to pretty much every social

3294
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:10,260
media known to man including all the

3295
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:13,620
Chinese ones they've got strange code to

3296
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:17,580
talk to both AWS S3 along with I think

3297
03:05:17,580 --> 03:05:19,800
it's the Baidu one but a similar object

3298
03:05:19,800 --> 03:05:21,240
storage thing in there there's a whole

3299
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:23,399
lot of other code in there and its job

3300
03:05:23,399 --> 03:05:25,080
so you know

3301
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:27,300
so we'll we'll start off simple this is

3302
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:29,580
the Android app you'll note I've

3303
03:05:29,580 --> 03:05:31,620
highlighted the find function what this

3304
03:05:31,620 --> 03:05:33,660
does is if you tap it your watch will

3305
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:36,300
vibrate so that you can find it

3306
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:38,220
um in 10 minutes time when the message

3307
03:05:38,220 --> 03:05:40,500
actually gets through

3308
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:43,620
um so what you do is you go into jet X

3309
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:46,020
and you find where this happens in the

3310
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:46,800
code

3311
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:49,140
um this is where like I say you if

3312
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:51,420
you've done Java app development at any

3313
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:52,319
point

3314
03:05:52,319 --> 03:05:54,540
this becomes easy to figure out what's

3315
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:57,300
going on um if you haven't

3316
03:05:57,300 --> 03:06:00,000
go buy yet another udemy course and

3317
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,140
spend five minutes learning it's

3318
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:04,140
something about about Android apps so

3319
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:06,960
this is on the fragment which is part of

3320
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:09,060
the screen that shows up you'll see

3321
03:06:09,060 --> 03:06:10,260
there's a line that I've highlighted

3322
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:13,620
there which is command pool right like I

3323
03:06:13,620 --> 03:06:16,740
say everything's a queue and um it's

3324
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:20,399
this get send find me value and the

3325
03:06:20,399 --> 03:06:22,859
Chinese there I think says find the

3326
03:06:22,859 --> 03:06:24,960
phone or find device or something like

3327
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:25,979
that

3328
03:06:25,979 --> 03:06:27,479
so what you do is you go dig through

3329
03:06:27,479 --> 03:06:28,620
that

3330
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:31,979
um so the top is the get set find me

3331
03:06:31,979 --> 03:06:34,439
value that then passes through to switch

3332
03:06:34,439 --> 03:06:37,200
protocol switch protocol then builds up

3333
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:40,200
this string of uh well the string array

3334
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:41,880
of bytes

3335
03:06:41,880 --> 03:06:44,700
so like I say it's really easy to figure

3336
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:46,260
out what's going on

3337
03:06:46,260 --> 03:06:48,300
you can then

3338
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:50,340
work backwards from there and you can

3339
03:06:50,340 --> 03:06:51,660
say well this is the byte string that's

3340
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:53,460
been sent to my device

3341
03:06:53,460 --> 03:06:54,960
and the interesting bit there that

3342
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:57,120
negative 51 just means you take it and

3343
03:06:57,120 --> 03:07:00,600
subtract it from 255 256 one in the two

3344
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:03,180
and you'll get a value out um Java is

3345
03:07:03,180 --> 03:07:05,460
weird and I think it might just be the

3346
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:08,160
decompiling but I noticed this is done

3347
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:12,180
all over in this particular app

3348
03:07:12,180 --> 03:07:15,180
um once you've done that you now need to

3349
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:17,580
figure out how it writes it so again you

3350
03:07:17,580 --> 03:07:19,439
look at this you say well okay we'll go

3351
03:07:19,439 --> 03:07:21,240
look at what makes command pool right

3352
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:22,920
work

3353
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:25,800
all it does is it adds a right command

3354
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:28,640
to a command pool

3355
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:31,819
and looking at that

3356
03:07:31,819 --> 03:07:34,500
the sort of gut reaction as well okay so

3357
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:37,859
it's a generic ad command command method

3358
03:07:37,859 --> 03:07:40,680
so what is Right char

3359
03:07:40,680 --> 03:07:42,540
so you go and look up what right size

3360
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:45,300
and right Char is a characteristic what

3361
03:07:45,300 --> 03:07:47,520
that means in the ble world is that's

3362
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:50,100
basically the end point that you're

3363
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:51,540
going to write your stuff to it's

3364
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:54,060
normally along uuid

3365
03:07:54,060 --> 03:07:56,279
when you're writing over Bluetooth you

3366
03:07:56,279 --> 03:07:58,319
need to translate the uuid to an actual

3367
03:07:58,319 --> 03:08:00,720
handle which is a text value

3368
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:04,740
so you go dig through you get your uuid

3369
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:06,300
and you put all this together so now

3370
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:08,160
what I have is I have the string of

3371
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:10,800
bytes that needs to do something and

3372
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:14,040
along with that I have where to send it

3373
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:15,240
so

3374
03:08:15,240 --> 03:08:17,700
we'll put something together quick this

3375
03:08:17,700 --> 03:08:20,880
is just some quick code to do all the

3376
03:08:20,880 --> 03:08:22,680
various manipulations of the bytes

3377
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:25,080
because I'm lazy and then it just prints

3378
03:08:25,080 --> 03:08:27,600
it out as a string if you're curious all

3379
03:08:27,600 --> 03:08:30,120
the code is available on GitHub so at

3380
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:31,140
the bottom there there's a bunch of

3381
03:08:31,140 --> 03:08:33,479
strings there's a bunch of bytes you

3382
03:08:33,479 --> 03:08:35,340
push those bytes through so first thing

3383
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:37,640
you need to do is find a device on Linux

3384
03:08:37,640 --> 03:08:41,040
HCI tool Le scan will do it that will

3385
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:43,140
find the device

3386
03:08:43,140 --> 03:08:46,740
you then take that you have to find the

3387
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:51,180
handle for that particular uuid so you

3388
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:52,979
can run this child description that

3389
03:08:52,979 --> 03:08:55,979
brings up all the uuids and then through

3390
03:08:55,979 --> 03:08:57,479
there you'll wait through until you find

3391
03:08:57,479 --> 03:08:59,220
the handle like I say you can also just

3392
03:08:59,220 --> 03:09:01,560
use an RF connect to find it's way

3393
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:03,120
easier but yeah

3394
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:05,520
yeah we need we needed more slides

3395
03:09:05,520 --> 03:09:07,560
um so finally you put it all together

3396
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:10,020
and you get a command line like this and

3397
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:10,859
then

3398
03:09:10,859 --> 03:09:12,960
well then you run it and this is what

3399
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:14,520
happens

3400
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:16,740
oh

3401
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:18,779
it works

3402
03:09:18,779 --> 03:09:20,460
now

3403
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:23,160
this it took me about two months three

3404
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:26,580
months to get to this point I know yeah

3405
03:09:26,580 --> 03:09:29,100
um and this this talk is uh there's a

3406
03:09:29,100 --> 03:09:31,020
lot of dead ends that aren't showing up

3407
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:33,060
this is not you know five minutes of

3408
03:09:33,060 --> 03:09:34,979
messing around

3409
03:09:34,979 --> 03:09:37,260
um but cool we're getting somewhere okay

3410
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:39,540
so no notifications now I'm not going to

3411
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:41,819
walk you through how notifications work

3412
03:09:41,819 --> 03:09:44,100
I have put up some code that will

3413
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:46,080
generate a valid notification strings

3414
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:48,300
there's also a blog post that explains

3415
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:50,520
all of the stuff in much more detail but

3416
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:52,500
basically if you go there you can get

3417
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:55,740
the code so what that does is it will

3418
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:58,560
come back with a long string of bytes

3419
03:09:58,560 --> 03:10:01,200
you pass these bytes um because of the

3420
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:04,020
way Bluetooth low energy works in this

3421
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:05,939
particular case it can only be 20 bytes

3422
03:10:05,939 --> 03:10:07,859
long so you have to split it into two

3423
03:10:07,859 --> 03:10:10,979
rights and you send them

3424
03:10:10,979 --> 03:10:14,220
and then this will happen

3425
03:10:14,220 --> 03:10:16,640
eventually

3426
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:20,600
now

3427
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:24,000
trust me I don't have a Serial on my

3428
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,580
phone this device wasn't connected to my

3429
03:10:26,580 --> 03:10:28,620
phone so you can send messages from

3430
03:10:28,620 --> 03:10:31,979
anyone any number to this device the fun

3431
03:10:31,979 --> 03:10:35,220
thing is it supports WhatsApp and SMS QQ

3432
03:10:35,220 --> 03:10:36,960
WeChat

3433
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:40,319
Facebook LinkedIn Skype and a whole lot

3434
03:10:40,319 --> 03:10:41,220
of other

3435
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:43,020
protocols that will show up so you can

3436
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:45,240
pretend to be anyone and send it your

3437
03:10:45,240 --> 03:10:48,199
watch a notification

3438
03:10:48,660 --> 03:10:52,279
anyone knows this anything odd

3439
03:10:53,580 --> 03:10:55,680
hmm

3440
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:57,779
now

3441
03:10:57,779 --> 03:11:01,080
yeah so um no Authentication

3442
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:02,880
no keys

3443
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:06,500
didn't even have to pay with the device

3444
03:11:06,660 --> 03:11:08,460
yeah so security was clearly an

3445
03:11:08,460 --> 03:11:10,279
afterthought when they built this thing

3446
03:11:10,279 --> 03:11:13,439
the system on chip does support AES

3447
03:11:13,439 --> 03:11:16,100
encryption but no they can be bothered

3448
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:20,100
the SDK has examples of only exposing

3449
03:11:20,100 --> 03:11:21,660
certain things once you paired with the

3450
03:11:21,660 --> 03:11:25,319
device uh yeah that wasn't done either

3451
03:11:25,319 --> 03:11:26,060
um

3452
03:11:26,060 --> 03:11:28,380
the only actual security they

3453
03:11:28,380 --> 03:11:31,020
implemented was that the watch were only

3454
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:34,140
connect with one other device

3455
03:11:34,140 --> 03:11:35,939
but the Bluetooth connection is so

3456
03:11:35,939 --> 03:11:38,220
terrible that it will probably lose its

3457
03:11:38,220 --> 03:11:39,600
connection just while you're walking

3458
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:41,460
around so if you happen to walk near

3459
03:11:41,460 --> 03:11:43,140
someone else assuming you're really

3460
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:46,020
lucky in your device connects to it you

3461
03:11:46,020 --> 03:11:48,479
can just send them notifications if it

3462
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,100
is actually a pretty good strong

3463
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:52,740
connection all you have to do is put a

3464
03:11:52,740 --> 03:11:54,899
human body between the watch and the

3465
03:11:54,899 --> 03:11:57,120
device so if they have it paired with a

3466
03:11:57,120 --> 03:11:58,580
cell phone

3467
03:11:58,580 --> 03:12:01,500
the Bluetooth is terrible enough that it

3468
03:12:01,500 --> 03:12:03,359
won't go through a person so if you are

3469
03:12:03,359 --> 03:12:05,220
one of those people who wear a watch on

3470
03:12:05,220 --> 03:12:06,840
your left hand but put your cell phone

3471
03:12:06,840 --> 03:12:09,660
in your right pocket your cell phone and

3472
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:11,460
your watch will never communicate while

3473
03:12:11,460 --> 03:12:13,080
you're just standing around you have to

3474
03:12:13,080 --> 03:12:16,800
bring them together in some way

3475
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:18,720
um

3476
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:20,880
it even gets better than that uh there

3477
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:22,859
was a project I can't pronounce that I

3478
03:12:22,859 --> 03:12:24,359
think it's swine tooth we'll just go

3479
03:12:24,359 --> 03:12:25,500
with that

3480
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:27,240
um they did a research project where

3481
03:12:27,240 --> 03:12:28,920
they looked at Bluetooth across a whole

3482
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:30,359
lot of devices

3483
03:12:30,359 --> 03:12:33,120
and it turns out the t-link is in that

3484
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:36,359
list so these are the two CVS that are

3485
03:12:36,359 --> 03:12:37,740
listed um

3486
03:12:37,740 --> 03:12:40,260
I do like the fact that you know or

3487
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:42,420
possibly control the devices function by

3488
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:43,800
establishing an encryption connection

3489
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:46,859
with xero I think the ltk is a long-term

3490
03:12:46,859 --> 03:12:48,660
key

3491
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:50,819
um the other one is a buffer overflow

3492
03:12:50,819 --> 03:12:52,260
attack

3493
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:54,479
after reading these I suddenly realized

3494
03:12:54,479 --> 03:12:56,760
why my watch crashes a lot when I was

3495
03:12:56,760 --> 03:12:59,279
poking at it with random values and when

3496
03:12:59,279 --> 03:13:01,439
I mean crash I mean lock up dead the

3497
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:03,120
only way to get this revive it was rip

3498
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:05,220
the battery off and put it back in

3499
03:13:05,220 --> 03:13:08,640
um and this is probably why uh

3500
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:12,359
the sdks that have these things is all

3501
03:13:12,359 --> 03:13:14,819
of them and they did release a patch to

3502
03:13:14,819 --> 03:13:17,100
their SDK but the patch is an additional

3503
03:13:17,100 --> 03:13:19,620
file it's not a new version of the SDK

3504
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:22,200
so you download the SDK and then you

3505
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:24,479
have to apply their patch because it's

3506
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:27,000
separate I'm pretty sure no one ever

3507
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,040
applies that patch

3508
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:31,020
so I'm pretty sure that all of these

3509
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:34,640
things have similar vulnerabilities

3510
03:13:40,620 --> 03:13:42,359
the watch supports

3511
03:13:42,359 --> 03:13:44,640
OTA upgrades for those of you don't know

3512
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:46,859
that's um over the air

3513
03:13:46,859 --> 03:13:49,560
so let's go look at that

3514
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:52,620
so back into the Android code go poke

3515
03:13:52,620 --> 03:13:55,439
around and I found this line

3516
03:13:55,439 --> 03:13:58,260
Builder dot add header authorization

3517
03:13:58,260 --> 03:14:00,060
those of you who do anything with the

3518
03:14:00,060 --> 03:14:03,140
web hopefully will recognize that

3519
03:14:03,140 --> 03:14:06,000
constant.tok token could they have oh

3520
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,760
yes they did there is the bearer token

3521
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:11,700
in the code oh and it doesn't expire

3522
03:14:11,700 --> 03:14:12,779
either

3523
03:14:12,779 --> 03:14:15,120
so um you can take the bearer token and

3524
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:16,979
you can query the API

3525
03:14:16,979 --> 03:14:20,160
so let's there's the how the builds the

3526
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:22,560
API string I've got all those values so

3527
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:25,979
let's plug them all in and run it

3528
03:14:25,979 --> 03:14:26,939
back

3529
03:14:26,939 --> 03:14:28,800
now uh my friend Ross sitting in

3530
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:30,899
Frontier he had a poke at this API when

3531
03:14:30,899 --> 03:14:32,640
I showed him this much much later I

3532
03:14:32,640 --> 03:14:34,859
should have shown him earlier he poked

3533
03:14:34,859 --> 03:14:36,240
at the API and he actually managed to

3534
03:14:36,240 --> 03:14:39,180
get some binary images off of it I so

3535
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:41,399
there's work still to be done but like I

3536
03:14:41,399 --> 03:14:43,560
say it's there

3537
03:14:43,560 --> 03:14:45,000
um but we'll go a little bit further how

3538
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,819
does OTA upgrade work well there's a

3539
03:14:47,819 --> 03:14:50,399
spot OTA let's go look at that so start

3540
03:14:50,399 --> 03:14:52,500
OTA sends something

3541
03:14:52,500 --> 03:14:53,939
to an endpoint

3542
03:14:53,939 --> 03:14:56,580
okay let's go look

3543
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:57,540
cool

3544
03:14:57,540 --> 03:14:59,640
and there's a passer

3545
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:01,979
so the parser takes your binary image

3546
03:15:01,979 --> 03:15:03,359
breaks it up into a whole lot of blocks

3547
03:15:03,359 --> 03:15:06,359
taxes CRC on the end taxi index on the

3548
03:15:06,359 --> 03:15:08,779
front and

3549
03:15:09,479 --> 03:15:12,000
the send OTA prepare command now that

3550
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:15,960
just sends a few bytes to an endpoint

3551
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:18,420
there's other commands so there's start

3552
03:15:18,420 --> 03:15:20,700
OTA there's a send end OTA which

3553
03:15:20,700 --> 03:15:24,060
includes the checksum and uh that's

3554
03:15:24,060 --> 03:15:26,100
about it so okay let's do the same as

3555
03:15:26,100 --> 03:15:27,800
last time let's go look at our OTA

3556
03:15:27,800 --> 03:15:30,180
characteristic so we'll dig through that

3557
03:15:30,180 --> 03:15:32,040
we'll get a uuid

3558
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:34,080
we've got the commands now we know that

3559
03:15:34,080 --> 03:15:36,000
OTA prepare and we know what the start

3560
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,620
command is and we know there's an N with

3561
03:15:37,620 --> 03:15:39,120
a checksum

3562
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:41,880
so let's try it what could go wrong

3563
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:44,760
yeah so you take that tool again because

3564
03:15:44,760 --> 03:15:47,520
I feel like it uh do all the backwards

3565
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:49,439
working so you can get a handle for the

3566
03:15:49,439 --> 03:15:52,020
particular characteristic and we're

3567
03:15:52,020 --> 03:15:54,779
going to write the start OTA command to

3568
03:15:54,779 --> 03:15:57,060
it and see what happens

3569
03:15:57,060 --> 03:15:59,819
the device suddenly changes name

3570
03:15:59,819 --> 03:16:03,359
it also goes black so at this point the

3571
03:16:03,359 --> 03:16:05,700
device is called t-link remote which

3572
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:08,520
lt71 6 anymore

3573
03:16:08,520 --> 03:16:09,840
that's cool

3574
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:12,720
yeah it turns out you can't get out of

3575
03:16:12,720 --> 03:16:14,880
OTA mode once you're in it didn't know

3576
03:16:14,880 --> 03:16:16,800
that so this one got added to the pile

3577
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:19,500
of bricked watches

3578
03:16:19,500 --> 03:16:23,040
and again no authentication no keys

3579
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:24,779
didn't even have to pay and it gets

3580
03:16:24,779 --> 03:16:25,620
worse

3581
03:16:25,620 --> 03:16:27,720
no validation checks

3582
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:29,819
that means that in a room like this and

3583
03:16:29,819 --> 03:16:31,979
this is why there's no live demo if I

3584
03:16:31,979 --> 03:16:34,560
get the MAC address wrong I can brick a

3585
03:16:34,560 --> 03:16:37,200
watch just from standing yeah Lovely

3586
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:38,399
isn't it

3587
03:16:38,399 --> 03:16:39,479
okay

3588
03:16:39,479 --> 03:16:40,800
that's fine

3589
03:16:40,800 --> 03:16:43,020
so let's talk about the firmware

3590
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:45,180
um again

3591
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:48,120
t-link offer a free SDK very kindly uh

3592
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:49,979
there's a whole lot of questionable GPL

3593
03:16:49,979 --> 03:16:52,620
violations in this but we won't go into

3594
03:16:52,620 --> 03:16:56,040
those they also have an IDE based on

3595
03:16:56,040 --> 03:16:58,740
Eclipse all of this only runs on Windows

3596
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:02,880
there is a free tc32 compiler based off

3597
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:05,340
of GCC but they've never released the

3598
03:17:05,340 --> 03:17:09,300
code but there's a compiler at least and

3599
03:17:09,300 --> 03:17:11,880
Raphael has packaged it all together

3600
03:17:11,880 --> 03:17:13,560
into a Docker image if you don't run

3601
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:15,720
Windows and to be honest the docker

3602
03:17:15,720 --> 03:17:17,460
image is much nicer than trying to fight

3603
03:17:17,460 --> 03:17:19,100
with Eclipse

3604
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:22,380
so we know enough about device and the

3605
03:17:22,380 --> 03:17:24,420
hard way to write something

3606
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:26,880
it would be easy to toggle a gpio for

3607
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:29,700
example I'm blinking LED I could start

3608
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:31,979
guessing the SBI bus commands to write

3609
03:17:31,979 --> 03:17:33,420
to the LCD

3610
03:17:33,420 --> 03:17:35,700
the problem is that there's no reliable

3611
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:38,399
way to upload the firmware to device so

3612
03:17:38,399 --> 03:17:40,740
options of experimentation become very

3613
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:42,479
very limited

3614
03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:45,180
so we know we can upload something via

3615
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:46,859
OTA update one of I want to try

3616
03:17:46,859 --> 03:17:51,180
uploading an OTA enabled firmware image

3617
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:54,660
and we can use one of the example apps

3618
03:17:54,660 --> 03:17:56,340
and if it works then we have a starting

3619
03:17:56,340 --> 03:18:00,260
point so do this so we'll build this

3620
03:18:00,260 --> 03:18:04,380
5136 remote ble which is in there SDK

3621
03:18:04,380 --> 03:18:06,300
um the reason I'm choosing this

3622
03:18:06,300 --> 03:18:08,420
particular one is because it's got

3623
03:18:08,420 --> 03:18:10,920
according to the code it's got over the

3624
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:12,180
air updates

3625
03:18:12,180 --> 03:18:13,859
enabled

3626
03:18:13,859 --> 03:18:15,840
um and I can switch off all of the stuff

3627
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:18,359
it's for building a ble remote control

3628
03:18:18,359 --> 03:18:21,240
but you can just turn off all the Matrix

3629
03:18:21,240 --> 03:18:23,460
keyboard stuff and things like that

3630
03:18:23,460 --> 03:18:25,859
so cool I'll make a small change to the

3631
03:18:25,859 --> 03:18:27,960
code just so that I know my code's

3632
03:18:27,960 --> 03:18:29,819
loaded so we'll just change what the

3633
03:18:29,819 --> 03:18:32,700
name of the device is to my name and

3634
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:35,760
we'll build it gives us a bin file

3635
03:18:35,760 --> 03:18:37,080
um then what I did was I took the

3636
03:18:37,080 --> 03:18:39,180
parsing code out of the Android app

3637
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:42,779
stuck it in to a Java app put all the

3638
03:18:42,779 --> 03:18:45,180
missing bits and pieces around that and

3639
03:18:45,180 --> 03:18:47,220
then made it so that it would split out

3640
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:49,920
get two command lines literally just

3641
03:18:49,920 --> 03:18:52,200
print the console copy paste stick in sh

3642
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:53,760
file please

3643
03:18:53,760 --> 03:18:57,240
so here we have we go and get the handle

3644
03:18:57,240 --> 03:19:00,899
again for OTA updates we have our script

3645
03:19:00,899 --> 03:19:03,960
I've cut it in half because it's 400 and

3646
03:19:03,960 --> 03:19:06,420
something lines but this should do an

3647
03:19:06,420 --> 03:19:09,899
update right so we'll run the script and

3648
03:19:09,899 --> 03:19:11,640
then

3649
03:19:11,640 --> 03:19:14,520
yeah the device vanished

3650
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:16,920
so at this point

3651
03:19:16,920 --> 03:19:19,380
I'm very very sure I've bricked the

3652
03:19:19,380 --> 03:19:24,120
device again no keys no filmy checks

3653
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:27,300
no validation not even proper checksums

3654
03:19:27,300 --> 03:19:30,540
oh at no signed firmware updates either

3655
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:33,359
this is all just poking random values at

3656
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:35,399
the device

3657
03:19:35,399 --> 03:19:38,100
um so at this point I kind of give up

3658
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:38,760
um

3659
03:19:38,760 --> 03:19:41,160
I have spent three months poking at a

3660
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:41,939
device

3661
03:19:41,939 --> 03:19:43,979
and I have found all kinds of scary

3662
03:19:43,979 --> 03:19:46,680
things and I have a bunch of them dead

3663
03:19:46,680 --> 03:19:48,479
so

3664
03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:50,460
I can't program it anymore over

3665
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:53,520
Bluetooth uh I don't have a working SWS

3666
03:19:53,520 --> 03:19:55,800
debugger and I have three working

3667
03:19:55,800 --> 03:19:57,660
watches left

3668
03:19:57,660 --> 03:19:59,040
um so obviously I'm not going to

3669
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:02,580
constantly try over the air updates

3670
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:03,779
but

3671
03:20:03,779 --> 03:20:05,700
there will be more to come

3672
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,380
um like I say sharing this project with

3673
03:20:07,380 --> 03:20:11,160
Ross I found out I got some binary

3674
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:14,100
images what this means is that in theory

3675
03:20:14,100 --> 03:20:17,220
I can decompile them and poke at those

3676
03:20:17,220 --> 03:20:20,460
um it's not obviously it's a weird

3677
03:20:20,460 --> 03:20:22,080
no one's heard of proprietary

3678
03:20:22,080 --> 03:20:24,359
architecture so guidra doesn't support

3679
03:20:24,359 --> 03:20:27,960
it but someone has hacked some support

3680
03:20:27,960 --> 03:20:30,300
in on gedra and it does kind of work so

3681
03:20:30,300 --> 03:20:32,160
you can at least get disassemblies you

3682
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:34,920
won't get actual code that part hasn't

3683
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:38,520
been finished yet which means that in

3684
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:39,899
theory I could take the firmware apart

3685
03:20:39,899 --> 03:20:42,120
and poke at it the other nice thing is

3686
03:20:42,120 --> 03:20:43,920
that means that I might be able to patch

3687
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:46,200
the firmware the way the OTA update

3688
03:20:46,200 --> 03:20:50,520
works you pass it an index of the bytes

3689
03:20:50,520 --> 03:20:51,899
that you want to over that you're

3690
03:20:51,899 --> 03:20:54,140
uploading but it also means that you can

3691
03:20:54,140 --> 03:20:57,140
upload a patch because you can say only

3692
03:20:57,140 --> 03:21:01,380
update bytes these few bytes say bytes

3693
03:21:01,380 --> 03:21:04,020
20 to 40 and leave the rest alone which

3694
03:21:04,020 --> 03:21:05,880
means that if I have a working if I have

3695
03:21:05,880 --> 03:21:08,279
a firmware image I can then patch the

3696
03:21:08,279 --> 03:21:10,680
binary and put my own features into it

3697
03:21:10,680 --> 03:21:12,920
which means that I could make a watch

3698
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:15,660
that does something magical when I send

3699
03:21:15,660 --> 03:21:17,660
it a particular command

3700
03:21:17,660 --> 03:21:20,279
or maybe a watch that when it sees

3701
03:21:20,279 --> 03:21:23,040
another watch it sends its firmware

3702
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:24,660
across to that watch which means that

3703
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:26,340
that watch could then send its firmware

3704
03:21:26,340 --> 03:21:28,319
to another watch which means that at

3705
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:29,700
some point someone's going to come and

3706
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:31,380
say Hey listen why did you go and break

3707
03:21:31,380 --> 03:21:33,120
20 watches

3708
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:34,620
um

3709
03:21:34,620 --> 03:21:36,899
like I say there are documents for the

3710
03:21:36,899 --> 03:21:39,479
SWS protocol and they were leaked at

3711
03:21:39,479 --> 03:21:41,700
some point if you go and search in

3712
03:21:41,700 --> 03:21:43,620
Google you will fight you can't find

3713
03:21:43,620 --> 03:21:46,080
them um they are open source projects

3714
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:48,899
that do talk it so I could try and fix

3715
03:21:48,899 --> 03:21:51,600
whatever's broken with that and or I

3716
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:53,399
could just go give in spend the money

3717
03:21:53,399 --> 03:21:55,439
buy the official programmer and that's

3718
03:21:55,439 --> 03:21:58,140
my talk um for those of you wondering or

3719
03:21:58,140 --> 03:21:59,819
want more information and all the things

3720
03:21:59,819 --> 03:22:02,000
that didn't make it into this talk

3721
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,319
that's my website it's got a Blog

3722
03:22:04,319 --> 03:22:06,240
article that I wrote while doing all

3723
03:22:06,240 --> 03:22:09,120
this I'm terribly sorry it's 6 000 and

3724
03:22:09,120 --> 03:22:11,220
something words it's really long but

3725
03:22:11,220 --> 03:22:12,660
maybe you'll find something interesting

3726
03:22:12,660 --> 03:22:16,260
it's also got links to all the tools and

3727
03:22:16,260 --> 03:22:19,260
all the code it's also got all of the

3728
03:22:19,260 --> 03:22:21,060
other things that I found along the way

3729
03:22:21,060 --> 03:22:24,240
that might be interesting um also people

3730
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:27,720
information Bluetooth guides on reverse

3731
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:30,060
engineering Bluetooth if you are

3732
03:22:30,060 --> 03:22:31,380
interested in that kind of thing Auto

3733
03:22:31,380 --> 03:22:34,500
fruit has a whole series of blog posts

3734
03:22:34,500 --> 03:22:35,880
all about reverse engineering Bluetooth

3735
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:37,680
they're really well written they're

3736
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:39,120
really dumbed down they're perfect for

3737
03:22:39,120 --> 03:22:40,500
people like me

3738
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:42,960
and yeah at some point in the future I

3739
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:45,420
will I promise revive my Dead collection

3740
03:22:45,420 --> 03:22:47,939
of watches I spent 600 Rand on them I

I started the video

3848
04:10:27,359 --> 04:10:29,160
that's that's that that's the only thing

3849
04:10:29,160 --> 04:10:31,640
that you'll see

3850
04:10:38,699 --> 04:10:41,060

04:10:49,500 --> 04:10:52,279
all right nice

3852
04:10:54,840 --> 04:10:57,239
so I'm going to start the switch later

3853
04:10:57,239 --> 04:10:59,939
on we probably only need oh we probably

3854
04:10:59,939 --> 04:11:02,779
only need one marked um

3855
04:11:02,779 --> 04:11:05,399
just one more thing because of load

3856
04:11:05,399 --> 04:11:07,080
shedding the air cons are off so we're

okay that works um

3871
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:20,699
yeah I'm sorry again ex-nip reviewed

3872
04:12:20,699 --> 04:12:24,120
expenses dude now also do that I think

3873
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:25,819
so this is

3874
04:12:25,819 --> 04:12:28,199
consideration we're going to talk about

3875
04:12:28,199 --> 04:12:31,500
Canary tokens thanks a lot for giving us

3876
04:12:31,500 --> 04:12:33,120
the opportunity to talk about yourself

3877
04:12:33,120 --> 04:12:35,640
we we like talking about this stuff

3878
04:12:35,640 --> 04:12:38,239
where the defense enthusiasts

3879
04:12:38,239 --> 04:12:41,399
have some skins the sandbox game so

3880
04:12:41,399 --> 04:12:43,439
we'll share some insights over there

3881
04:12:43,439 --> 04:12:46,140
otherwise tokens are

3882
04:12:46,140 --> 04:12:48,540
um why you should use them the tldr is

3883
04:12:48,540 --> 04:12:51,060
using and we'll go through some tokens

3884
04:12:51,060 --> 04:12:54,899
some use cases and then have the end you

3885
04:12:54,899 --> 04:12:57,479
should be able to use the

3886
04:12:57,479 --> 04:13:00,000
third detections

3887
04:13:00,000 --> 04:13:02,100
Okay cool so white Oracle area tokens

3888
04:13:02,100 --> 04:13:04,500
and a super high level it's just a

3889
04:13:04,500 --> 04:13:07,199
unique identifier that when you interact

3890
04:13:07,199 --> 04:13:08,340
with it

3891
04:13:08,340 --> 04:13:09,840
so those

3892
04:13:09,840 --> 04:13:12,660
um if you're familiar with a web or a

3893
04:13:12,660 --> 04:13:14,760
tracking pixel it's just a one by one

3894
04:13:14,760 --> 04:13:16,739
you know image that gets called active

3895
04:13:16,739 --> 04:13:19,500
web server and that is one of the sort

3896
04:13:19,500 --> 04:13:22,020
of communication channels that Canary

3897
04:13:22,020 --> 04:13:23,880
token system is called

3898
04:13:23,880 --> 04:13:26,520
keep that in the back of the old mind so

3899
04:13:26,520 --> 04:13:27,479
now

3900
04:13:27,479 --> 04:13:28,500
okay

3901
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:30,120
um

3902
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:31,800
you know anybody that's active on your

3903
04:13:31,800 --> 04:13:34,080
network as a service like like this age

3904
04:13:34,080 --> 04:13:36,180
interact with it that captures

3905
04:13:36,180 --> 04:13:37,920
or unlocks whatever is being interacted

3906
04:13:37,920 --> 04:13:39,420
with and you know maybe sounds

3907
04:13:39,420 --> 04:13:40,920
absolutely

3908
04:13:40,920 --> 04:13:43,319
um there's always just dormant objects

3909
04:13:43,319 --> 04:13:44,760
that you're going to sprinkle all around

3910
04:13:44,760 --> 04:13:46,140
and

3911
04:13:46,140 --> 04:13:48,620
usually easier than to employ a

3912
04:13:48,620 --> 04:13:52,620
not a good area but because there's no

3913
04:13:52,620 --> 04:13:54,960
installation it's just like copy paste I

3914
04:13:54,960 --> 04:13:56,819
mean that obviously excludes Canary

3915
04:13:56,819 --> 04:13:59,960
antibodies or so

3916
04:14:04,399 --> 04:14:08,640
they're absolutely super effective

3917
04:14:08,640 --> 04:14:10,680
a lot of tweets with people getting a

3918
04:14:10,680 --> 04:14:11,939
lot of just

3919
04:14:11,939 --> 04:14:12,899
wonderful

3920
04:14:12,899 --> 04:14:16,260
you might run into an edge case where a

3921
04:14:16,260 --> 04:14:18,060
token doesn't trigger and that doesn't

3922
04:14:18,060 --> 04:14:19,800
mean that the token's not effective

3923
04:14:19,800 --> 04:14:21,779
they're not understanding and nuts and

3924
04:14:21,779 --> 04:14:23,100
thoughts of how these things work we'll

3925
04:14:23,100 --> 04:14:25,199
cover it and

3926
04:14:25,199 --> 04:14:27,120
strategies that you can ensure that you

3927
04:14:27,120 --> 04:14:31,080
get your protection out of the tokens

3928
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:33,359
okay it's just a little bit of a side

3929
04:14:33,359 --> 04:14:35,699
place like this on the advocacy mostly

3930
04:14:35,699 --> 04:14:38,340
we're using them in our own or corporate

3931
04:14:38,340 --> 04:14:40,979
networks or sort of just regular events

3932
04:14:40,979 --> 04:14:44,279
of operation but we do get some reliable

3933
04:14:44,279 --> 04:14:46,020
being back every now and again for

3934
04:14:46,020 --> 04:14:47,880
different types of use cases and a nice

3935
04:14:47,880 --> 04:14:49,380
one to get is from you know law

3936
04:14:49,380 --> 04:14:51,120
enforcement saying I can hear each other

3937
04:14:51,120 --> 04:14:52,199
can help

3938
04:14:52,199 --> 04:14:54,720
them to prosecute a criminal so we might

3939
04:14:54,720 --> 04:14:56,399
understand that it requires something

3940
04:14:56,399 --> 04:14:58,020
into it we observe it as a source like

3941
04:14:58,020 --> 04:15:00,439
me we can

3942
04:15:03,739 --> 04:15:06,000
maybe not always

3943
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:06,840
um

3944
04:15:06,840 --> 04:15:09,960
as easy for a law enforcement officer

3945
04:15:09,960 --> 04:15:11,640
but they can easily generate an area

3946
04:15:11,640 --> 04:15:13,560
token to get the criminals to interact

3947
04:15:13,560 --> 04:15:14,819
with it and they can work with that

3948
04:15:14,819 --> 04:15:17,778
telemetry

3949
04:15:17,819 --> 04:15:20,100
okay so how does all this fit into sort

3950
04:15:20,100 --> 04:15:22,560
of our day-to-day

3951
04:15:22,560 --> 04:15:23,399
um

3952
04:15:23,399 --> 04:15:26,040
pretty much boils down to reducing the

3953
04:15:26,040 --> 04:15:29,399
world time so I kind of referred to a

3954
04:15:29,399 --> 04:15:32,279
swine report an IBM reporter this year

3955
04:15:32,279 --> 04:15:35,100
and it mentions on all times around 200

3956
04:15:35,100 --> 04:15:37,620
days it's quite a sucky number two to

3957
04:15:37,620 --> 04:15:39,000
work with you want to kind of detect

3958
04:15:39,000 --> 04:15:41,279
before that and respond so that's the

3959
04:15:41,279 --> 04:15:44,160
idea with hearing tokens there are these

3960
04:15:44,160 --> 04:15:46,160
um

3961
04:15:46,240 --> 04:15:49,350
[Music]

3962
04:15:51,859 --> 04:15:54,960
increases the opportunity for them

3963
04:15:54,960 --> 04:15:56,880
dropping up then the unit testing and

3964
04:15:56,880 --> 04:15:58,439
the Badness on your network and again

3965
04:15:58,439 --> 04:16:00,779
there are just so super easy to deploy

3966
04:16:00,779 --> 04:16:03,840
that you know you just really should be

3967
04:16:03,840 --> 04:16:06,779
um should be doing that

3968
04:16:06,779 --> 04:16:09,359
okay um so what do they look like we're

3969
04:16:09,359 --> 04:16:11,460
moving away from the like

3970
04:16:11,460 --> 04:16:14,040
high level

3971
04:16:14,040 --> 04:16:16,080
a unique identify I think it's sort of a

3972
04:16:16,080 --> 04:16:17,939
tangible space so it could be a file a

3973
04:16:17,939 --> 04:16:20,880
document a key anything like that that

3974
04:16:20,880 --> 04:16:23,460
attaches it you get alert but

3975
04:16:23,460 --> 04:16:25,800
importantly yeah I'll probably reiterate

3976
04:16:25,800 --> 04:16:28,560
and stress this is that at the you know

3977
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:30,540
under the under the hood it's just an

3978
04:16:30,540 --> 04:16:33,000
HTTP request or a DNA slope that's going

3979
04:16:33,000 --> 04:16:35,720
to trigger these alerts

3980
04:16:35,720 --> 04:16:38,699
okay so when that um you know when that

3981
04:16:38,699 --> 04:16:40,199
request is made it depends on Canary

3982
04:16:40,199 --> 04:16:42,000
token server you get an option of either

3983
04:16:42,000 --> 04:16:43,800
sending sending alert via email or a

3984
04:16:43,800 --> 04:16:44,420
webwork or you can

3985
04:16:44,420 --> 04:16:46,140
[Music]

3986
04:16:46,140 --> 04:16:47,819
you know use

3987
04:16:47,819 --> 04:16:50,399
both converting channels

3988
04:16:50,399 --> 04:16:51,720
you're going to want to deploy them

3989
04:16:51,720 --> 04:16:52,739
everywhere

3990
04:16:52,739 --> 04:16:55,140
and so think of well firstly you can

3991
04:16:55,140 --> 04:16:56,760
drop them sort of on to existing

3992
04:16:56,760 --> 04:16:58,819
infrastructure or even embed them into

3993
04:16:58,819 --> 04:17:01,859
applications common use cases would be

3994
04:17:01,859 --> 04:17:05,699
high value targets so let's say zfo CTO

3995
04:17:05,699 --> 04:17:08,220
CEO starting the desktop type something

3996
04:17:08,220 --> 04:17:11,760
on there Cloud environments file shares

3997
04:17:11,760 --> 04:17:15,960
email Jack logs so if we think of uh to

3998
04:17:15,960 --> 04:17:18,660
use a business email compromise as an

3999
04:17:18,660 --> 04:17:20,460
example attack code gains access to the

4000
04:17:20,460 --> 04:17:22,800
mailbox starts thinking or searching for

4001
04:17:22,800 --> 04:17:25,080
keywords like credentials passwords

4002
04:17:25,080 --> 04:17:27,420
access and that's kind of the procedure

4003
04:17:27,420 --> 04:17:28,859
it's going to be the same with your

4004
04:17:28,859 --> 04:17:31,620
communication tool so someone's of your

4005
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:34,319
team so it's like um you've gone to

4006
04:17:34,319 --> 04:17:36,180
their edited an old message in the chat

4007
04:17:36,180 --> 04:17:38,580
added those keywords in there and the

4008
04:17:38,580 --> 04:17:40,859
token someone attaches a token you know

4009
04:17:40,859 --> 04:17:43,380
the teams has been so let's make a

4010
04:17:43,380 --> 04:17:44,640
little bit all over

4011
04:17:44,640 --> 04:17:46,380
um another cool thing is it doesn't

4012
04:17:46,380 --> 04:17:47,520
matter if

4013
04:17:47,520 --> 04:17:49,800
um if the token's executed on the point

4014
04:17:49,800 --> 04:17:51,120
where you place it or if it's

4015
04:17:51,120 --> 04:17:53,699
infiltrated it's still going to generate

4016
04:17:53,699 --> 04:17:55,260
dependent so

4017
04:17:55,260 --> 04:17:58,800
an example of a token NBA is an athlete

4018
04:17:58,800 --> 04:18:00,600
would be the word Canary token so we're

4019
04:18:00,600 --> 04:18:02,340
dropping it on an executive's machine

4020
04:18:02,340 --> 04:18:05,100
hobio and now the attacker compromises

4021
04:18:05,100 --> 04:18:07,560
the endpoint to grabs the document

4022
04:18:07,560 --> 04:18:09,899
um you know Excel traits opens it up you

4023
04:18:09,899 --> 04:18:11,640
know a week later different geographical

4024
04:18:11,640 --> 04:18:14,699
location VPN or just coffee shop or

4025
04:18:14,699 --> 04:18:17,160
whatever just somewhere else right and

4026
04:18:17,160 --> 04:18:19,859
we'll still get the alert

4027
04:18:19,859 --> 04:18:22,020
so you're going to see the the learning

4028
04:18:22,020 --> 04:18:23,520
protection is a public IP address you

4029
04:18:23,520 --> 04:18:24,899
know it's not

4030
04:18:24,899 --> 04:18:26,880
it might not really mean much to us but

4031
04:18:26,880 --> 04:18:29,340
we configured this token reminder field

4032
04:18:29,340 --> 04:18:31,680
that says CTO

4033
04:18:31,680 --> 04:18:33,720
and with all tokens this is super

4034
04:18:33,720 --> 04:18:35,279
important to configure this as

4035
04:18:35,279 --> 04:18:37,560
descriptively as possible was the load

4036
04:18:37,560 --> 04:18:39,420
saying this thing may be placed on the

4037
04:18:39,420 --> 04:18:41,220
CPS desktop has been accessed let's

4038
04:18:41,220 --> 04:18:42,899
start on investigation over there for

4039
04:18:42,899 --> 04:18:47,479
malicious or suspicious activity

4040
04:18:47,880 --> 04:18:50,220
okay different types of tokens uh if you

4041
04:18:50,220 --> 04:18:51,600
ever to decide to see a bunch of

4042
04:18:51,600 --> 04:18:52,859
interesting different types of tokens

4043
04:18:52,859 --> 04:18:55,020
we'll be covering the way about the DNS

4044
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:58,500
token AWS word and then we'll Tinker

4045
04:18:58,500 --> 04:19:02,580
with Q config and why I got okay

4046
04:19:02,580 --> 04:19:05,580
foreign

4047
04:19:21,319 --> 04:19:23,220
token and then we're going to go ahead

4048
04:19:23,220 --> 04:19:25,680
and create some more exciting types and

4049
04:19:25,680 --> 04:19:27,660
so the reason we we do the Weber again

4050
04:19:27,660 --> 04:19:29,939
the DNS token first is just to explain

4051
04:19:29,939 --> 04:19:32,460
again how the the topics work under the

4052
04:19:32,460 --> 04:19:34,140
hood so these are the Primitive types

4053
04:19:34,140 --> 04:19:36,120
the basic pulling blocks they've already

4054
04:19:36,120 --> 04:19:37,859
been embedded into many of these other

4055
04:19:37,859 --> 04:19:40,020
token types for you so what we're about

4056
04:19:40,020 --> 04:19:43,140
is just a URL so I'm just going to say

4057
04:19:43,140 --> 04:19:46,199
send it to nissansp gmail.com and now

4058
04:19:46,199 --> 04:19:48,540
we're just going to say grip test let's

4059
04:19:48,540 --> 04:19:50,279
play we hit create

4060
04:19:50,279 --> 04:19:53,460
we get a URL of you and it says it gives

4061
04:19:53,460 --> 04:19:54,840
you descriptions it's going to trigger

4062
04:19:54,840 --> 04:19:57,540
if this resume and then some you know

4063
04:19:57,540 --> 04:19:58,979
interesting question you could include

4064
04:19:58,979 --> 04:20:01,800
it in an image tag which creates like a

4065
04:20:01,800 --> 04:20:04,199
tracking pixel and then down here you'll

4066
04:20:04,199 --> 04:20:07,439
get some ideas for usage embedded in a

4067
04:20:07,439 --> 04:20:09,600
document or dock it on a page there's

4068
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:11,340
anything then it gets found through a

4069
04:20:11,340 --> 04:20:13,800
group for us group a Brute Force tool or

4070
04:20:13,800 --> 04:20:15,779
a crawler or something so not part of

4071
04:20:15,779 --> 04:20:18,840
your regular application flip Okay so

4072
04:20:18,840 --> 04:20:20,399
I'm just going to copy this off

4073
04:20:20,399 --> 04:20:22,859
requested in my browser triggering the

4074
04:20:22,859 --> 04:20:24,000
alert

4075
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:26,160
and we'll revert to have a look at the

4076
04:20:26,160 --> 04:20:27,899
actuality in a second

4077
04:20:27,899 --> 04:20:29,699
and what I'm going to do now is just

4078
04:20:29,699 --> 04:20:32,040
create that other sort of basic token as

4079
04:20:32,040 --> 04:20:36,120
well so let's go with uh DNS token over

4080
04:20:36,120 --> 04:20:40,220
here same email address again

4081
04:20:40,500 --> 04:20:43,760
there we go okay and we say DNS test

4082
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:46,560
create token this time it's a hostname

4083
04:20:46,560 --> 04:20:49,140
again you get the description saying if

4084
04:20:49,140 --> 04:20:50,939
we perform a DNS lookup it's going to

4085
04:20:50,939 --> 04:20:52,859
trigger an alert and then some

4086
04:20:52,859 --> 04:20:55,080
interesting use cases drop it in your

4087
04:20:55,080 --> 04:20:58,140
patch history drop it in SSH config and

4088
04:20:58,140 --> 04:20:59,340
down here

4089
04:20:59,340 --> 04:21:02,100
is a cool example if I even sort of

4090
04:21:02,100 --> 04:21:03,720
start building your own detection so you

4091
04:21:03,720 --> 04:21:05,640
can see here we're tiling an auth log

4092
04:21:05,640 --> 04:21:07,380
and then if there's a valid Earth

4093
04:21:07,380 --> 04:21:09,899
attempt we're just going to run the the

4094
04:21:09,899 --> 04:21:12,960
host command over there so I'll just

4095
04:21:12,960 --> 04:21:14,880
demonstrate that as well

4096
04:21:14,880 --> 04:21:17,580
just a simple DNS resolution will

4097
04:21:17,580 --> 04:21:20,100
trigger the alert

4098
04:21:20,100 --> 04:21:21,479
okay so let's quickly have a look at

4099
04:21:21,479 --> 04:21:23,640
those two alerts

4100
04:21:23,640 --> 04:21:25,620
okay so that's the HTTP alerts with our

4101
04:21:25,620 --> 04:21:27,600
reminder that we sit over there we get

4102
04:21:27,600 --> 04:21:30,060
our source ID and we get the user agents

4103
04:21:30,060 --> 04:21:32,220
included and as part of that hdb

4104
04:21:32,220 --> 04:21:36,479
callback okay the DNS alert DNS test and

4105
04:21:36,479 --> 04:21:38,880
down here the source IP is the

4106
04:21:38,880 --> 04:21:41,460
the last years of the result of that

4107
04:21:41,460 --> 04:21:42,840
person

4108
04:21:42,840 --> 04:21:44,460
okay so let's go ahead and create some

4109
04:21:44,460 --> 04:21:46,380
more exciting ones and so I'm going to

4110
04:21:46,380 --> 04:21:49,380
go with a Word document and then an AWS

4111
04:21:49,380 --> 04:21:50,939
token

4112
04:21:50,939 --> 04:21:55,560
word doc in it same email and let's say

4113
04:21:55,560 --> 04:21:59,520
we're doc on Sirens scanning machine as

4114
04:21:59,520 --> 04:22:01,260
a as an example

4115
04:22:01,260 --> 04:22:04,800
there create another token and you can

4116
04:22:04,800 --> 04:22:06,720
rename this in you know to something

4117
04:22:06,720 --> 04:22:09,239
entice and call it part so let's add

4118
04:22:09,239 --> 04:22:12,359
some some Titania but essentially Ms

4119
04:22:12,359 --> 04:22:14,399
word opening up is going to cause that

4120
04:22:14,399 --> 04:22:18,239
that thing back via VIA HTTP okay so

4121
04:22:18,239 --> 04:22:20,040
that's that's a word doc we can see the

4122
04:22:20,040 --> 04:22:22,439
little trickling in over there and let's

4123
04:22:22,439 --> 04:22:26,220
have a look at the AWS key as well

4124
04:22:26,220 --> 04:22:29,760
here we go email address let's say AWS

4125
04:22:29,760 --> 04:22:33,739
key on either a home assistant

4126
04:22:33,739 --> 04:22:36,060
here great

4127
04:22:36,060 --> 04:22:37,560
and this time around you'll see it's

4128
04:22:37,560 --> 04:22:39,180
just going to split up to you know a

4129
04:22:39,180 --> 04:22:41,819
valid AWS config that you can drop into

4130
04:22:41,819 --> 04:22:43,140
your

4131
04:22:43,140 --> 04:22:46,979
AWS credential file so I've gone ahead

4132
04:22:46,979 --> 04:22:48,660
and added a token into this AWS

4133
04:22:48,660 --> 04:22:53,040
credential and we can run just a an S3

4134
04:22:53,040 --> 04:22:56,180
LS command

4135
04:22:56,340 --> 04:22:58,680
okay so that's just going to say use the

4136
04:22:58,680 --> 04:23:02,840
Amazon CLI run S3 LS

4137
04:23:03,300 --> 04:23:05,699
this is like the upward we see access

4138
04:23:05,699 --> 04:23:08,880
denied that that uh token or the API key

4139
04:23:08,880 --> 04:23:10,319
doesn't actually have access to to

4140
04:23:10,319 --> 04:23:13,080
perform much but the you already have

4141
04:23:13,080 --> 04:23:14,699
the the you know the attackers just

4142
04:23:14,699 --> 04:23:16,140
using their key to enumerate the

4143
04:23:16,140 --> 04:23:19,319
potential potential AWS account okay so

4144
04:23:19,319 --> 04:23:21,300
that's that's the tokens that we wanted

4145
04:23:21,300 --> 04:23:23,699
to cover here we'll see the

4146
04:23:23,699 --> 04:23:25,920
um the word doctors come in using again

4147
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:28,739
the Primitive HTTP Channel word.com my

4148
04:23:28,739 --> 04:23:31,140
gaming machine Source like the user

4149
04:23:31,140 --> 04:23:34,399
agent and you'll notice that the AWS

4150
04:23:34,399 --> 04:23:37,319
alert hasn't uh trickled in and that's

4151
04:23:37,319 --> 04:23:40,319
kind of because of how the token works

4152
04:23:40,319 --> 04:23:42,239
on the AWS pack and then we'll cover

4153
04:23:42,239 --> 04:23:44,760
that in a couple of moments as well okay

4154
04:23:44,760 --> 04:23:47,100
so just reverting back to the slides to

4155
04:23:47,100 --> 04:23:50,100
cover what we went through

4156
04:23:50,100 --> 04:23:52,620
um so that so sorry that we're back is

4157
04:23:52,620 --> 04:23:54,840
just a URL that you visit it's going to

4158
04:23:54,840 --> 04:23:56,640
generate so loads and there's there's

4159
04:23:56,640 --> 04:23:58,500
two variants of the stone so there's a

4160
04:23:58,500 --> 04:24:00,960
fast and a slow redirect it does exactly

4161
04:24:00,960 --> 04:24:02,460
what it is it's just going to redirect

4162
04:24:02,460 --> 04:24:05,699
to a URL that you you specify difference

4163
04:24:05,699 --> 04:24:07,920
between the two the slowly and it will

4164
04:24:07,920 --> 04:24:09,479
run some dollars to open your browser

4165
04:24:09,479 --> 04:24:13,020
and grab information so you can you know

4166
04:24:13,020 --> 04:24:15,840
redirect your company homepage or if you

4167
04:24:15,840 --> 04:24:17,819
feel like drilling someone hanging a

4168
04:24:17,819 --> 04:24:21,300
recall redirect and that some kind of

4169
04:24:21,300 --> 04:24:23,399
okay DNS open as you saw just another

4170
04:24:23,399 --> 04:24:25,859
thing we resolve it um it triggers an

4171
04:24:25,859 --> 04:24:28,199
alert and there's enough extra feature

4172
04:24:28,199 --> 04:24:30,120
which we'll cover as well that you can

4173
04:24:30,120 --> 04:24:32,880
repaint some data in that DNS look up

4174
04:24:32,880 --> 04:24:33,960
and then you've seen some additional

4175
04:24:33,960 --> 04:24:37,859
data with your your DNS token and DNA

4176
04:24:37,859 --> 04:24:41,479
Stokes is super flexible if you think of

4177
04:24:41,479 --> 04:24:43,800
anything that's connected to a hostname

4178
04:24:43,800 --> 04:24:45,540
provides an opportunity for you to shut

4179
04:24:45,540 --> 04:24:47,220
in that token and then if a connection

4180
04:24:47,220 --> 04:24:49,380
is made it's going to trigger an element

4181
04:24:49,380 --> 04:24:52,319
and also DNS being DNS you know it's

4182
04:24:52,319 --> 04:24:54,359
likely just going to get out the network

4183
04:24:54,359 --> 04:24:56,699
it's not so often the case screen you

4184
04:24:56,699 --> 04:24:58,920
know DNS is restricted so you're going

4185
04:24:58,920 --> 04:25:01,500
to get your alerts using the DNA's

4186
04:25:01,500 --> 04:25:04,380
derivative Channel

4187
04:25:04,380 --> 04:25:06,300
okay that we're not you know you can

4188
04:25:06,300 --> 04:25:07,800
imagine drop it on your own endpoint

4189
04:25:07,800 --> 04:25:09,660
drop it in a corporate setting on that

4190
04:25:09,660 --> 04:25:11,520
high value Target

4191
04:25:11,520 --> 04:25:13,140
um using that and again it uses that

4192
04:25:13,140 --> 04:25:15,300
basic ACP callback mechanism so maybe

4193
04:25:15,300 --> 04:25:17,040
some of you are thinking

4194
04:25:17,040 --> 04:25:19,439
um what happens if I open this

4195
04:25:19,439 --> 04:25:22,680
um without internet connectivity it's

4196
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:24,060
not going to drag it right because you

4197
04:25:24,060 --> 04:25:26,160
need I mean you need that internet basic

4198
04:25:26,160 --> 04:25:28,140
thing and then we've kind of entered

4199
04:25:28,140 --> 04:25:30,120
towards this when we spoke about that

4200
04:25:30,120 --> 04:25:32,520
you could see a lot of token and so I'm

4201
04:25:32,520 --> 04:25:33,779
going to cover the

4202
04:25:33,779 --> 04:25:36,000
the AWS token and then I'll revert back

4203
04:25:36,000 --> 04:25:38,159
to the question and just provide you

4204
04:25:38,159 --> 04:25:40,500
with the solution of how it stackers

4205
04:25:40,500 --> 04:25:42,659
into differently getting in alerts out

4206
04:25:42,659 --> 04:25:44,880
of your your tokens

4207
04:25:44,880 --> 04:25:49,020
okay so that AWS e validated credentials

4208
04:25:49,020 --> 04:25:51,359
um really enticing hyperbility alerts

4209
04:25:51,359 --> 04:25:54,359
you're not expecting a regular user to

4210
04:25:54,359 --> 04:25:57,420
install awcli perform API queries and so

4211
04:25:57,420 --> 04:25:59,100
you know I definitely recommend

4212
04:25:59,100 --> 04:26:02,100
like I don't use it and not tied to your

4213
04:26:02,100 --> 04:26:04,020
infrastructure at all just do this on

4214
04:26:04,020 --> 04:26:05,520
our back end

4215
04:26:05,520 --> 04:26:07,020
um yeah I mean there's credentials

4216
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:08,580
attackers need to use it and it's

4217
04:26:08,580 --> 04:26:10,500
enticing because you can potentially

4218
04:26:10,500 --> 04:26:12,359
gain access to an entire

4219
04:26:12,359 --> 04:26:14,580
um you know list account

4220
04:26:14,580 --> 04:26:17,640
okay so I'm sure that AWS Elizabeth has

4221
04:26:17,640 --> 04:26:19,620
made its way into the mailbox by now and

4222
04:26:19,620 --> 04:26:22,020
we can have a look but just to cover the

4223
04:26:22,020 --> 04:26:24,359
sort of the Thousand bolts of this token

4224
04:26:24,359 --> 04:26:26,520
we're monitoring for for cloudtrail

4225
04:26:26,520 --> 04:26:28,020
events on the back end once that's

4226
04:26:28,020 --> 04:26:30,420
raised we send an alert

4227
04:26:30,420 --> 04:26:33,000
um so if you playing around with

4228
04:26:33,000 --> 04:26:34,920
database you know that there's you know

4229
04:26:34,920 --> 04:26:36,420
things thousands different types of

4230
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:39,779
services and there are cases where some

4231
04:26:39,779 --> 04:26:41,279
of those services like you get holds

4232
04:26:41,279 --> 04:26:43,439
down like a child trade event so we made

4233
04:26:43,439 --> 04:26:46,500
it once into the stocking where if uh

4234
04:26:46,500 --> 04:26:48,300
the green if liquidation was used but

4235
04:26:48,300 --> 04:26:50,040
there's no Cloud relevant we'll raise

4236
04:26:50,040 --> 04:26:52,020
the safety nuclear which is an

4237
04:26:52,020 --> 04:26:53,520
interesting piece of the language in its

4238
04:26:53,520 --> 04:26:55,739
own would mean I chance someone made an

4239
04:26:55,739 --> 04:26:58,020
API call there's no Cloud really looking

4240
04:26:58,020 --> 04:27:00,120
for or you're dealing with someone with

4241
04:27:00,120 --> 04:27:03,300
some level of sophistication or a little

4242
04:27:03,300 --> 04:27:06,960
bit of in-depth AWS knowledge

4243
04:27:06,960 --> 04:27:09,899
okay so I might do that if you can see

4244
04:27:09,899 --> 04:27:12,060
what happens if we use a Word document

4245
04:27:12,060 --> 04:27:13,800
and there's no connectivity involved

4246
04:27:13,800 --> 04:27:15,840
then you go for this sort of token

4247
04:27:15,840 --> 04:27:17,220
stacking technique

4248
04:27:17,220 --> 04:27:19,800
and what you can see here is we've added

4249
04:27:19,800 --> 04:27:21,720
some you know enticing information in

4250
04:27:21,720 --> 04:27:23,520
that word block this is how we get

4251
04:27:23,520 --> 04:27:26,520
access to the CWS and please don't share

4252
04:27:26,520 --> 04:27:28,199
these credentials and its linear token

4253
04:27:28,199 --> 04:27:30,000
open it up without internet connectivity

4254
04:27:30,000 --> 04:27:31,800
it doesn't matter attack is going to

4255
04:27:31,800 --> 04:27:33,960
want to touch the Amazon API and you'll

4256
04:27:33,960 --> 04:27:36,120
get your products and it's not that I

4257
04:27:36,120 --> 04:27:37,319
mean it's open that you can travel near

4258
04:27:37,319 --> 04:27:39,720
anything internet facing you can't see

4259
04:27:39,720 --> 04:27:41,460
why I've got they're going to want to

4260
04:27:41,460 --> 04:27:44,778
touch it you'll hear it during it

4261
04:27:44,880 --> 04:27:46,260
okay

4262
04:27:46,260 --> 04:27:48,960
um so keeping that in mind we wanted to

4263
04:27:48,960 --> 04:27:50,880
see which different types of devices we

4264
04:27:50,880 --> 04:27:53,340
could totalize and we you know keeping

4265
04:27:53,340 --> 04:27:55,260
back up our mind working from our own PC

4266
04:27:55,260 --> 04:27:57,300
at the end usage we sort of asked

4267
04:27:57,300 --> 04:27:59,580
ourselves what devices do you have at

4268
04:27:59,580 --> 04:28:01,500
home and then you know you'll have some

4269
04:28:01,500 --> 04:28:03,120
some people from your device laptop

4270
04:28:03,120 --> 04:28:04,159
computer

4271
04:28:04,159 --> 04:28:08,159
a mobile device and maybe some sort of

4272
04:28:08,159 --> 04:28:09,600
Route you know getting your internet

4273
04:28:09,600 --> 04:28:12,000
access so we wanted to see if we could

4274
04:28:12,000 --> 04:28:15,060
tokenize different uh device types and

4275
04:28:15,060 --> 04:28:18,380
this is what we came up with

4276
04:28:23,939 --> 04:28:25,319
okay

4277
04:28:25,319 --> 04:28:26,880
um so first I'll just show you the the

4278
04:28:26,880 --> 04:28:28,560
wire guide so you can easily imagine

4279
04:28:28,560 --> 04:28:31,680
you're dropping an AWS key or a Word

4280
04:28:31,680 --> 04:28:34,859
document onto sort of a laptop or a or a

4281
04:28:34,859 --> 04:28:38,159
desktop and then the Y what token plays

4282
04:28:38,159 --> 04:28:39,540
pretty nicely into that from mobile

4283
04:28:39,540 --> 04:28:43,020
space so we can just say why I got on

4284
04:28:43,020 --> 04:28:45,540
uh sirens

4285
04:28:45,540 --> 04:28:48,180
iPhone it create

4286
04:28:48,180 --> 04:28:50,760
and what this does is it spits out a QR

4287
04:28:50,760 --> 04:28:52,560
code or I don't know why I got VPN

4288
04:28:52,560 --> 04:28:54,180
config that you can just add to your

4289
04:28:54,180 --> 04:28:56,460
phone so either

4290
04:28:56,460 --> 04:28:58,859
frequently added uh you know one of

4291
04:28:58,859 --> 04:29:00,239
these to my phone and I'll just connect

4292
04:29:00,239 --> 04:29:02,100
to the VPN and that's going to trigger

4293
04:29:02,100 --> 04:29:03,960
into those as well so we'll we'll have a

4294
04:29:03,960 --> 04:29:05,880
look at that Alert in a bit

4295
04:29:05,880 --> 04:29:08,279
so that's kind of got desktop laptop

4296
04:29:08,279 --> 04:29:10,319
mobile covered I can see that alert

4297
04:29:10,319 --> 04:29:12,899
opt-in but we wanted to check out

4298
04:29:12,899 --> 04:29:14,460
whether we could add some detection to

4299
04:29:14,460 --> 04:29:16,979
your sort of little um smaller office

4300
04:29:16,979 --> 04:29:20,520
home office router and so the inverter

4301
04:29:20,520 --> 04:29:22,859
came up with a detection for a Microtech

4302
04:29:22,859 --> 04:29:25,020
and you can see here it says that in AWS

4303
04:29:25,020 --> 04:29:26,580
it's just for the sake of the demo

4304
04:29:26,580 --> 04:29:27,960
typically this is on your home network

4305
04:29:27,960 --> 04:29:30,060
now once you touching this other than

4306
04:29:30,060 --> 04:29:33,540
you and we're going to try and log in

4307
04:29:33,540 --> 04:29:35,819
earlier and I think Google will probably

4308
04:29:35,819 --> 04:29:38,939
moan at me and then it didn't anyhow so

4309
04:29:38,939 --> 04:29:41,939
there we go nice and so let's have a

4310
04:29:41,939 --> 04:29:44,939
look at those two alerts over there so

4311
04:29:44,939 --> 04:29:46,800
um which one is this okay so there's the

4312
04:29:46,800 --> 04:29:48,300
wire guide on my phone so I try to

4313
04:29:48,300 --> 04:29:51,300
connect to VPN drag it in alert and then

4314
04:29:51,300 --> 04:29:53,640
see another one popping up over here so

4315
04:29:53,640 --> 04:29:55,620
here we go you decides to make a dick

4316
04:29:55,620 --> 04:29:58,739
Source ID and this time it's a DNA based

4317
04:29:58,739 --> 04:30:00,899
alert which you can see some extra data

4318
04:30:00,899 --> 04:30:02,399
and we'll cover that but yeah it's

4319
04:30:02,399 --> 04:30:04,680
saying someone you need to do the make

4320
04:30:04,680 --> 04:30:05,819
it take over the Web Channel they also

4321
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:08,520
admin and that's the ID inside the

4322
04:30:08,520 --> 04:30:12,500
microchix the long over there

4323
04:30:12,500 --> 04:30:14,699
yeah so that's

4324
04:30:14,699 --> 04:30:17,520
um how we did that we can move back to

4325
04:30:17,520 --> 04:30:18,779
the slides again

4326
04:30:18,779 --> 04:30:21,659
so then why I'm not talking is super

4327
04:30:21,659 --> 04:30:24,180
flexible there's a wire client for

4328
04:30:24,180 --> 04:30:26,340
almost all of the major operating

4329
04:30:26,340 --> 04:30:29,340
systems iOS Android Mac Windows whatever

4330
04:30:29,340 --> 04:30:32,880
so you can drop it pretty much anywhere

4331
04:30:32,880 --> 04:30:34,260
um I know if I compromise on the

4332
04:30:34,260 --> 04:30:35,880
endpoint and it says Port VPN I'm going

4333
04:30:35,880 --> 04:30:37,260
to want to check out what's behind that

4334
04:30:37,260 --> 04:30:38,340
in here

4335
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:39,239
um

4336
04:30:39,239 --> 04:30:40,979
I kind of have two ways of thinking

4337
04:30:40,979 --> 04:30:42,960
about the token as well so you can like

4338
04:30:42,960 --> 04:30:44,760
we did with the phone or you know other

4339
04:30:44,760 --> 04:30:47,460
device configure the actual VPN tunnel

4340
04:30:47,460 --> 04:30:48,840
and then when that connection's made its

4341
04:30:48,840 --> 04:30:50,460
triggers or you can just sprinkle the

4342
04:30:50,460 --> 04:30:52,859
files around so maybe you have a really

4343
04:30:52,859 --> 04:30:55,080
restricted Network Three jump boxes deep

4344
04:30:55,080 --> 04:30:57,779
dropper why I got quantites on each jump

4345
04:30:57,779 --> 04:30:59,880
box that way if the attacker Excel Trace

4346
04:30:59,880 --> 04:31:01,739
their config tries to connect to that

4347
04:31:01,739 --> 04:31:03,779
VPN you know they're on jump box one two

4348
04:31:03,779 --> 04:31:06,300
or three so really cool token recommend

4349
04:31:06,300 --> 04:31:07,979
using it as well

4350
04:31:07,979 --> 04:31:10,080
and then for the bigger ticket I'm sure

4351
04:31:10,080 --> 04:31:12,479
some light bulbs linked up already in

4352
04:31:12,479 --> 04:31:14,159
the audience how do you do this if

4353
04:31:14,159 --> 04:31:15,720
you're familiar with micro text I have a

4354
04:31:15,720 --> 04:31:17,640
little scripting engine so we're just

4355
04:31:17,640 --> 04:31:20,279
monitoring there for fail elongating and

4356
04:31:20,279 --> 04:31:22,439
then triggering that um again that

4357
04:31:22,439 --> 04:31:26,100
proactive DNS lookup okay so interesting

4358
04:31:26,100 --> 04:31:27,960
but there was that generic data and yeah

4359
04:31:27,960 --> 04:31:29,279
you can see it says you know it's

4360
04:31:29,279 --> 04:31:32,100
channels one box and the user was acting

4361
04:31:32,100 --> 04:31:34,020
and the attacker that the IP the

4362
04:31:34,020 --> 04:31:37,080
attacker came from was uh the other life

4363
04:31:37,080 --> 04:31:39,420
you can see over there and they will

4364
04:31:39,420 --> 04:31:41,699
share some of these fun that he had

4365
04:31:41,699 --> 04:31:45,060
added the generic data included in the

4366
04:31:45,060 --> 04:31:46,800
load content

4367
04:31:46,800 --> 04:31:49,920
cool so yeah yeah I mentioned I haven't

4368
04:31:49,920 --> 04:31:51,420
managed to get a architect reporting on

4369
04:31:51,420 --> 04:31:53,159
the DNS Channel

4370
04:31:53,159 --> 04:31:55,140
um that using one of the DNS Community

4371
04:31:55,140 --> 04:31:57,960
tokens and managed to uh offer some

4372
04:31:57,960 --> 04:31:59,399
difficulties actually include the

4373
04:31:59,399 --> 04:32:01,620
generic diets into that as well so as

4374
04:32:01,620 --> 04:32:03,479
mentioned before that's basically two

4375
04:32:03,479 --> 04:32:05,760
encoded um and it just forms like a

4376
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:07,739
prefix to the host name that gets

4377
04:32:07,739 --> 04:32:09,899
generated with the token following some

4378
04:32:09,899 --> 04:32:12,540
specific rules documented

4379
04:32:12,540 --> 04:32:14,239
book

4380
04:32:14,239 --> 04:32:17,220
in the past mechate gave us a full

4381
04:32:17,220 --> 04:32:19,199
scripting environment so it's probably

4382
04:32:19,199 --> 04:32:21,300
been pretty easy to implement using that

4383
04:32:21,300 --> 04:32:25,278
they then promptly removed it um

4384
04:32:27,779 --> 04:32:29,399
um struck down kind of scripting

4385
04:32:29,399 --> 04:32:31,560
environment with things like functions

4386
04:32:31,560 --> 04:32:35,100
or kind of kind of exotic ask so we had

4387
04:32:35,100 --> 04:32:37,380
to put some effort into

4388
04:32:37,380 --> 04:32:39,239
into simple things like just maps and

4389
04:32:39,239 --> 04:32:40,680
lookup tables just

4390
04:32:40,680 --> 04:32:42,239
kind of getting

4391
04:32:42,239 --> 04:32:44,640
values for SE characters and then it has

4392
04:32:44,640 --> 04:32:46,140
a lookup table for the best that we do

4393
04:32:46,140 --> 04:32:48,420
in Korean but uh yeah we got it right

4394
04:32:48,420 --> 04:32:50,399
the word works is it actually just

4395
04:32:50,399 --> 04:32:51,600
chills

4396
04:32:51,600 --> 04:32:53,760
um the authentication log in the vector

4397
04:32:53,760 --> 04:32:56,699
check CSL The Tint also after some

4398
04:32:56,699 --> 04:32:59,819
problems of string pausing imagine and

4399
04:32:59,819 --> 04:33:00,720
then

4400
04:33:00,720 --> 04:33:02,760
generates the basically two prefix and

4401
04:33:02,760 --> 04:33:05,219
uses the DNS token for that so watch we

4402
04:33:05,219 --> 04:33:06,719
thought the last thing about this was it

4403
04:33:06,719 --> 04:33:08,458
using the channel you know one box in

4404
04:33:08,458 --> 04:33:11,099
this case but uh we

4405
04:33:11,099 --> 04:33:13,400
like SSH or something maybe it's

4406
04:33:13,400 --> 04:33:15,480
specifically of a number of different

4407
04:33:15,480 --> 04:33:17,039
channels you can access them over the

4408
04:33:17,039 --> 04:33:21,061
web API https and

4409
04:33:21,061 --> 04:33:23,580
so 50p login so it's good to get a

4410
04:33:23,580 --> 04:33:25,980
little bit of extra info you might it

4411
04:33:25,980 --> 04:33:27,719
might help in terms of figuring out what

4412
04:33:27,719 --> 04:33:29,759
what it was left open on the firewall

4413
04:33:29,759 --> 04:33:32,340
you know that unbox it and one plus FTP

4414
04:33:32,340 --> 04:33:33,660
that's pretty strange if someone's

4415
04:33:33,660 --> 04:33:36,240
accessing the APL of your own router

4416
04:33:36,240 --> 04:33:38,458
that's really really warning and then

4417
04:33:38,458 --> 04:33:41,299
obviously it's nice to have a

4418
04:33:41,759 --> 04:33:45,180
oh so that was the fun that we had over

4419
04:33:45,180 --> 04:33:46,320
there

4420
04:33:46,320 --> 04:33:49,141
um now we also got core we chose a

4421
04:33:49,141 --> 04:33:50,820
pretty feature Rich router you know not

4422
04:33:50,820 --> 04:33:52,859
everyone's running back and not

4423
04:33:52,859 --> 04:33:54,240
everything has a built-in script

4424
04:33:54,240 --> 04:33:55,080
environment

4425
04:33:55,080 --> 04:33:57,840
so we wanted to demonstrate that these

4426
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:59,580
tokens are super useful On Any Which

4427
04:33:59,580 --> 04:34:01,618
already and the prime example is

4428
04:34:01,618 --> 04:34:03,118
anything on the wire or a client you

4429
04:34:03,118 --> 04:34:04,980
know we're working on working these days

4430
04:34:04,980 --> 04:34:06,480
or set up

4431
04:34:06,480 --> 04:34:08,278
basically the amplifies aren't pretty

4432
04:34:08,278 --> 04:34:10,379
popular for managing that

4433
04:34:10,379 --> 04:34:11,278
um

4434
04:34:11,278 --> 04:34:13,680
so we can actually repurpose the wire up

4435
04:34:13,680 --> 04:34:16,259
token and that'll just work on any

4436
04:34:16,259 --> 04:34:18,118
region that supports the wireless client

4437
04:34:18,118 --> 04:34:20,458
and a storage service we can easily just

4438
04:34:20,458 --> 04:34:22,141
generate a new one copy the conflict

4439
04:34:22,141 --> 04:34:24,480
paste it into the original

4440
04:34:24,480 --> 04:34:26,400
fair enough where to call it something

4441
04:34:26,400 --> 04:34:29,039
cool like corporate VPN or Internet or

4442
04:34:29,039 --> 04:34:31,618
management admin info that's really

4443
04:34:31,618 --> 04:34:33,000
enticing for an attacker to try and

4444
04:34:33,000 --> 04:34:34,680
break into our Network they'll

4445
04:34:34,680 --> 04:34:36,061
definitely want to connect to that and

4446
04:34:36,061 --> 04:34:38,641
start rummaging around and that's on

4447
04:34:38,641 --> 04:34:41,580
they'll have triggered in the nucleus

4448
04:34:41,580 --> 04:34:45,539
um so on the beaches you know for people

4449
04:34:45,539 --> 04:34:47,219
like myself why go out to find a new

4450
04:34:47,219 --> 04:34:48,299
thing

4451
04:34:48,299 --> 04:34:50,580
um if you you don't export for that you

4452
04:34:50,580 --> 04:34:54,240
can also just repurpose the DMS token um

4453
04:34:54,240 --> 04:34:57,180
for you know just about any VPN function

4454
04:34:57,180 --> 04:34:59,820
I'm doing router so in this case

4455
04:34:59,820 --> 04:35:03,000
um we showed that it's a gel and it

4456
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:04,618
routes or pretty much any generic brand

4457
04:35:04,618 --> 04:35:09,141
and it supports open vegan so I'm also

4458
04:35:11,580 --> 04:35:13,259
he's just said there are my choice to

4459
04:35:13,259 --> 04:35:15,299
connect with my name make sure you

4460
04:35:15,299 --> 04:35:18,599
imitate it add in a token note and to

4461
04:35:18,599 --> 04:35:21,480
say cool like in my own route and token

4462
04:35:21,480 --> 04:35:23,278
and as soon as someone tries to connect

4463
04:35:23,278 --> 04:35:26,400
to that Channel or that VPN which will

4464
04:35:26,400 --> 04:35:28,561
not record like super important the

4465
04:35:28,561 --> 04:35:30,778
corporate VPN we'll get in the vote once

4466
04:35:30,778 --> 04:35:31,561
again

4467
04:35:31,561 --> 04:35:33,180
so it kind of just demonstrates again

4468
04:35:33,180 --> 04:35:34,500
I'll fix all these things that I already

4469
04:35:34,500 --> 04:35:36,061
can just sprinkle them around everywhere

4470
04:35:36,061 --> 04:35:39,419
and then just come up with new use cases

4471
04:35:39,419 --> 04:35:41,520
for that uh this just shows us that

4472
04:35:41,520 --> 04:35:43,199
alerts you know the first one was why I

4473
04:35:43,199 --> 04:35:45,240
got specific that totally reminders did

4474
04:35:45,240 --> 04:35:47,039
you do something or set as a child

4475
04:35:47,039 --> 04:35:48,180
mentioned

4476
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:49,500
um so I think there's definitely require

4477
04:35:49,500 --> 04:35:52,020
God but the next one is pretty generic

4478
04:35:52,020 --> 04:35:53,278
so we used

4479
04:35:53,278 --> 04:35:55,199
in this token on that

4480
04:35:55,199 --> 04:35:58,680
uses an open BBM types and but uh yeah

4481
04:35:58,680 --> 04:36:01,278
that's what I said

4482
04:36:01,859 --> 04:36:03,480
and it's also something if it's not

4483
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:05,458
something you recognize that also might

4484
04:36:05,458 --> 04:36:06,660
be

4485
04:36:06,660 --> 04:36:10,379
worth investigating cool so the next

4486
04:36:10,379 --> 04:36:13,740
thing is I think a lot of us end up

4487
04:36:13,740 --> 04:36:15,778
working a lot with CLC new systems and

4488
04:36:15,778 --> 04:36:17,340
maybe if you're working remotely a small

4489
04:36:17,340 --> 04:36:20,099
partner pushing it code to GitHub or

4490
04:36:20,099 --> 04:36:23,278
GitHub or something and a lot of that is

4491
04:36:23,278 --> 04:36:25,259
making it pretty extensive we have Dr

4492
04:36:25,259 --> 04:36:26,219
contain

4493
04:36:26,219 --> 04:36:27,900
content so I'm going to start

4494
04:36:27,900 --> 04:36:31,141
demonstrating how we can use that also

4495
04:36:31,141 --> 04:36:33,500
if it's just a

4496
04:36:33,500 --> 04:36:36,958
container and then move into uh how we

4497
04:36:36,958 --> 04:36:40,020
can apply that to a crcp system so first

4498
04:36:40,020 --> 04:36:41,580
we'll just have a look at um what our

4499
04:36:41,580 --> 04:36:43,259
Docker file looks like and this is just

4500
04:36:43,259 --> 04:36:45,719
a demonstration of a basic tokenized

4501
04:36:45,719 --> 04:36:47,580
software container and pull something

4502
04:36:47,580 --> 04:36:49,680
from like a standard repository we use

4503
04:36:49,680 --> 04:36:51,000
some sorts of documents you don't need

4504
04:36:51,000 --> 04:36:53,340
and then the important parts are just

4505
04:36:53,340 --> 04:36:55,320
copying a special C we went to The

4506
04:36:55,320 --> 04:36:57,500
Bachelor of C so that um

4507
04:36:57,500 --> 04:37:01,020
we would end up triggering this if

4508
04:37:01,020 --> 04:37:04,080
someone just executes a container like

4509
04:37:04,080 --> 04:37:05,879
they do a Docker run or they do a Docker

4510
04:37:05,879 --> 04:37:08,219
run or some argument or will they do a

4511
04:37:08,219 --> 04:37:10,080
doc exit into a running container it's

4512
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:12,299
also set the entry point to that and

4513
04:37:12,299 --> 04:37:14,759
we'll see how that works but cool so

4514
04:37:14,759 --> 04:37:18,660
let's just you know what

4515
04:37:19,379 --> 04:37:21,299
oops

4516
04:37:21,299 --> 04:37:24,739
and what that thought looks like

4517
04:37:26,580 --> 04:37:28,438
of course then sometimes we've just got

4518
04:37:28,438 --> 04:37:30,778
two functions super simple version not

4519
04:37:30,778 --> 04:37:34,218
your usual bash RC but uh

4520
04:37:34,859 --> 04:37:35,879
I think

4521
04:37:35,879 --> 04:37:38,699
check function and that has a token

4522
04:37:38,699 --> 04:37:41,039
variable city that has a DNS hostname

4523
04:37:41,039 --> 04:37:43,438
premium token and uh that just simply

4524
04:37:43,438 --> 04:37:44,879
just does our first on it so it

4525
04:37:44,879 --> 04:37:46,680
basically doesn't

4526
04:37:46,680 --> 04:37:49,141
it next we have a watch which is

4527
04:37:49,141 --> 04:37:51,118
basically what this is called as soon as

4528
04:37:51,118 --> 04:37:53,400
the script runs uh uses unnotify work

4529
04:37:53,400 --> 04:37:54,958
and I ask if I wanted to watchful file

4530
04:37:54,958 --> 04:37:58,199
system events and uh quietly want us

4531
04:37:58,199 --> 04:38:00,118
access to anything

4532
04:38:00,118 --> 04:38:03,118
cost environment so as soon as you try

4533
04:38:03,118 --> 04:38:04,980
and run something that such an apart on

4534
04:38:04,980 --> 04:38:07,500
Elvis or Luma or ID they'll probably

4535
04:38:07,500 --> 04:38:09,660
Trigger or your wall trigger

4536
04:38:09,660 --> 04:38:11,938
um and alert so

4537
04:38:11,938 --> 04:38:13,919
we'll see obviously it's in the clcd

4538
04:38:13,919 --> 04:38:15,778
thing later

4539
04:38:15,778 --> 04:38:17,778
um

4540
04:38:24,061 --> 04:38:25,859
so we can hold up and say and call it

4541
04:38:25,859 --> 04:38:27,419
something cool interesting like Secrets

4542
04:38:27,419 --> 04:38:28,500
management

4543
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:29,879
um that's um

4544
04:38:29,879 --> 04:38:32,119
foreign

4545
04:38:33,599 --> 04:38:36,118
what's going on inside there and then

4546
04:38:36,118 --> 04:38:38,641
you know like on ironic on like who am I

4547
04:38:38,641 --> 04:38:40,379
in the container

4548
04:38:40,379 --> 04:38:42,719
um it all looks good as usual but um

4549
04:38:42,719 --> 04:38:44,278
we're also treatment alert and you can

4550
04:38:44,278 --> 04:38:46,820
see it's really short

4551
04:38:48,180 --> 04:38:51,180
ly forward coming from this antenna cool

4552
04:38:51,180 --> 04:38:53,879
so that's the kind of Basics now we can

4553
04:38:53,879 --> 04:38:57,180
dive into Harvest a plaster CL or CE

4554
04:38:57,180 --> 04:38:59,278
environment and they've put together

4555
04:38:59,278 --> 04:39:01,740
this project for us just as an example

4556
04:39:01,740 --> 04:39:04,680
and to show us uh you know how we can go

4557
04:39:04,680 --> 04:39:06,599
about you listen

4558
04:39:06,599 --> 04:39:09,299
a more realistic or real life scenario

4559
04:39:09,299 --> 04:39:12,000
and I pulled a coats on it the reasoning

4560
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:13,859
was to kind of make it look like there

4561
04:39:13,859 --> 04:39:16,379
might be some uh private keys or

4562
04:39:16,379 --> 04:39:18,240
certificates embedded some windows

4563
04:39:18,240 --> 04:39:19,458
repository

4564
04:39:19,458 --> 04:39:24,061
and the the kind of sport process is if

4565
04:39:24,061 --> 04:39:26,039
someone gets access to this repo whether

4566
04:39:26,039 --> 04:39:28,141
it doesn't make public by accident or an

4567
04:39:28,141 --> 04:39:30,599
attack on which to compromise your good

4568
04:39:30,599 --> 04:39:33,080
lab server and get an account you know

4569
04:39:33,080 --> 04:39:35,160
they've likely to start poking around

4570
04:39:35,160 --> 04:39:36,599
and this this looks like a pretty

4571
04:39:36,599 --> 04:39:38,940
classic project or maybe the project was

4572
04:39:38,940 --> 04:39:41,340
made public due to some inauthentic

4573
04:39:41,340 --> 04:39:43,740
Behavior possibly coordinated by the

4574
04:39:43,740 --> 04:39:47,900
routine and yep

4575
04:39:58,860 --> 04:40:00,660
seems to be the only kind of active part

4576
04:40:00,660 --> 04:40:02,040
so

4577
04:40:02,040 --> 04:40:04,320
to meet us uh from a tech perspective

4578
04:40:04,320 --> 04:40:05,760
this literally what I'd be interested in

4579
04:40:05,760 --> 04:40:09,000
your followers okay

4580
04:40:09,000 --> 04:40:11,878
um just if you're familiar with Adobe CR

4581
04:40:11,878 --> 04:40:13,378
well I'll go through this we're putting

4582
04:40:13,378 --> 04:40:15,920
in a pretty sound

4583
04:40:20,480 --> 04:40:23,160
is usually used in the sense of

4584
04:40:23,160 --> 04:40:24,660
provincial management or C Bridge

4585
04:40:24,660 --> 04:40:27,540
management up as an attacker

4586
04:40:27,540 --> 04:40:31,100
before I came across something

4587
04:40:31,620 --> 04:40:33,240
about all to help there and this thing

4588
04:40:33,240 --> 04:40:35,340
looks like it's calling out using the

4589
04:40:35,340 --> 04:40:36,958
volt behind reached to sign code so it's

4590
04:40:36,958 --> 04:40:39,120
just a pretend to build a deploy stage

4591
04:40:39,120 --> 04:40:41,820
with the three power plants defined and

4592
04:40:41,820 --> 04:40:43,920
the first one just you know is ready to

4593
04:40:43,920 --> 04:40:46,820
appear like a size

4594
04:40:47,100 --> 04:40:50,700
and creates more effects so

4595
04:40:50,700 --> 04:40:52,620
what what will be going when I saw the

4596
04:40:52,620 --> 04:40:54,480
container it could be like so I mean

4597
04:40:54,480 --> 04:40:56,400
edit certificates or keys I don't use

4598
04:40:56,400 --> 04:40:58,200
sound code but it can then approach to

4599
04:40:58,200 --> 04:40:59,458
the rest of our infrastructure and run

4600
04:40:59,458 --> 04:41:02,458
we'll deploy next and we've got to copy

4601
04:41:02,458 --> 04:41:04,500
js3 we'll go through that

4602
04:41:04,500 --> 04:41:06,718
in any more death but it's like oh we're

4603
04:41:06,718 --> 04:41:08,400
getting head over here that looks

4604
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:11,160
interesting trees Falls gifts using

4605
04:41:11,160 --> 04:41:13,020
fault again differently uh there's

4606
04:41:13,020 --> 04:41:14,458
literally something going on in their

4607
04:41:14,458 --> 04:41:16,138
full Docker container if you want to

4608
04:41:16,138 --> 04:41:17,638
poke around that

4609
04:41:17,638 --> 04:41:18,900
um at least from attackers because

4610
04:41:18,900 --> 04:41:21,840
they've then we're in naively

4611
04:41:21,840 --> 04:41:25,440
um console uh all our good log and find

4612
04:41:25,440 --> 04:41:27,540
about it so it looks like we might be

4613
04:41:27,540 --> 04:41:29,280
getting access to a history market or

4614
04:41:29,280 --> 04:41:31,378
something but if you want to see what's

4615
04:41:31,378 --> 04:41:33,000
happening with those credentials and

4616
04:41:33,000 --> 04:41:35,218
lastly like this is was keys to the

4617
04:41:35,218 --> 04:41:38,520
kingdom we see a cube conflict

4618
04:41:38,520 --> 04:41:40,798
so putting in a generic image name just

4619
04:41:40,798 --> 04:41:43,860
the latest version of it like this

4620
04:41:43,860 --> 04:41:45,740
is a specific

4621
04:41:45,740 --> 04:41:47,760
container so they definitely won't be

4622
04:41:47,760 --> 04:41:49,940
anything interested in there it's public

4623
04:41:49,940 --> 04:41:52,500
but it looks like later on we've got

4624
04:41:52,500 --> 04:41:56,218
this CR variable defined

4625
04:41:56,218 --> 04:42:00,020
that um must contain

4626
04:42:00,020 --> 04:42:02,458
clamps and server keys to allow us to

4627
04:42:02,458 --> 04:42:04,560
talk to the community zone so as an

4628
04:42:04,560 --> 04:42:05,820
attacker if I can get access to

4629
04:42:05,820 --> 04:42:08,760
kubernetes clustered that's looking

4630
04:42:08,760 --> 04:42:10,320
pretty exciting I'm definitely going to

4631
04:42:10,320 --> 04:42:12,420
try and run them see how it gets trust

4632
04:42:12,420 --> 04:42:13,920
info okay

4633
04:42:13,920 --> 04:42:15,840
and let's take a look at this Parkland

4634
04:42:15,840 --> 04:42:18,900
and see what uh what what the output

4635
04:42:18,900 --> 04:42:20,580
looks like I mean we're definitely from

4636
04:42:20,580 --> 04:42:22,980
Texas perspective I want to see what the

4637
04:42:22,980 --> 04:42:24,060
log out because I see if there's

4638
04:42:24,060 --> 04:42:25,560
anything interesting there

4639
04:42:25,560 --> 04:42:26,280
um

4640
04:42:26,280 --> 04:42:30,200
so this looks like just sign something

4641
04:42:30,200 --> 04:42:32,700
artifacts so we've

4642
04:42:32,700 --> 04:42:35,458
um in lieu of actually broken around and

4643
04:42:35,458 --> 04:42:37,620
I'll just rerun this Pipeline and also

4644
04:42:37,620 --> 04:42:40,620
I've seen some of the words coming in

4645
04:42:40,620 --> 04:42:43,560
uh so this is a

4646
04:42:43,560 --> 04:42:46,340
previously

4647
04:42:46,680 --> 04:42:48,920
foreign

4648
04:42:53,480 --> 04:42:56,549
[Music]

4649
04:43:03,190 --> 04:43:05,480
[Music]

4650
04:43:05,480 --> 04:43:09,420
exporting them and now they're going

4651
04:43:09,420 --> 04:43:12,298
into the console so from again an

4652
04:43:12,298 --> 04:43:13,980
attacker perspective I definitely want

4653
04:43:13,980 --> 04:43:15,958
to see

4654
04:43:15,958 --> 04:43:18,840
credentials trying to see what we've got

4655
04:43:18,840 --> 04:43:20,760
access to doesn't give us access to an

4656
04:43:20,760 --> 04:43:23,040
account and multiple accounts um you

4657
04:43:23,040 --> 04:43:24,780
know how much

4658
04:43:24,780 --> 04:43:27,900
drink suppose so as soon as you try and

4659
04:43:27,900 --> 04:43:30,420
use them for anything that's Tyron or

4660
04:43:30,420 --> 04:43:33,240
demonstrate about the AWS client or CLI

4661
04:43:33,240 --> 04:43:35,878
uh and alert or immediately trigger so

4662
04:43:35,878 --> 04:43:38,040
again you can see that they can from the

4663
04:43:38,040 --> 04:43:39,900
open potentials they don't actually have

4664
04:43:39,900 --> 04:43:43,080
access to anything even the holidays but

4665
04:43:43,080 --> 04:43:45,060
as soon as they use their old training

4666
04:43:45,060 --> 04:43:48,120
mode so far by two reruns part one for

4667
04:43:48,120 --> 04:43:49,798
example you'll probably see one of these

4668
04:43:49,798 --> 04:43:52,560
uh whether it's coming through and then

4669
04:43:52,560 --> 04:43:54,958
lastly just to show kind of an

4670
04:43:54,958 --> 04:43:57,600
interesting use of the newer tokens

4671
04:43:57,600 --> 04:43:58,798
which is the

4672
04:43:58,798 --> 04:44:02,218
and communities token it's a it's

4673
04:44:02,218 --> 04:44:05,100
actually a full cube conflict file so

4674
04:44:05,100 --> 04:44:06,958
you can just pass it through it into

4675
04:44:06,958 --> 04:44:09,958
Cube CTL user to see what happens

4676
04:44:09,958 --> 04:44:11,940
um in this it doesn't actually look like

4677
04:44:11,940 --> 04:44:14,160
we we're having a cube conflict from the

4678
04:44:14,160 --> 04:44:16,500
environment using Q and qtl I'm trying

4679
04:44:16,500 --> 04:44:19,378
to just get trusted in further from it

4680
04:44:19,378 --> 04:44:21,840
um the token itself just came from the

4681
04:44:21,840 --> 04:44:25,440
back end influence just enough to uh

4682
04:44:25,440 --> 04:44:27,600
complete the negotiation to the point

4683
04:44:27,600 --> 04:44:29,100
where we can give an unauthorized

4684
04:44:29,100 --> 04:44:30,540
response which is all we need because

4685
04:44:30,540 --> 04:44:32,700
while that's on we've already got an

4686
04:44:32,700 --> 04:44:34,798
alert tokens to their next job we know

4687
04:44:34,798 --> 04:44:36,360
if someone is using this config they

4688
04:44:36,360 --> 04:44:39,000
really should not be if we really run

4689
04:44:39,000 --> 04:44:40,980
that we'll probably um

4690
04:44:40,980 --> 04:44:44,040
probably see when they're coming shortly

4691
04:44:44,040 --> 04:44:46,740
out so we can also just have a look at

4692
04:44:46,740 --> 04:44:49,260
the crcd variables

4693
04:44:49,260 --> 04:44:52,020
to see what that token looks like and as

4694
04:44:52,020 --> 04:44:53,580
expected though just from the pop-up

4695
04:44:53,580 --> 04:44:54,958
it's uh

4696
04:44:54,958 --> 04:44:58,138
it's a 64 encoded vision of a cube

4697
04:44:58,138 --> 04:45:00,600
contract um point being like we can

4698
04:45:00,600 --> 04:45:02,760
predict very well as a mask and whatever

4699
04:45:02,760 --> 04:45:04,500
that's if an attacker gets stuck and

4700
04:45:04,500 --> 04:45:06,600
maintain access to the repository you're

4701
04:45:06,600 --> 04:45:08,280
still going to be able to read the raw

4702
04:45:08,280 --> 04:45:09,958
text and just cut the basics of 40

4703
04:45:09,958 --> 04:45:11,878
credit

4704
04:45:11,878 --> 04:45:15,540
um yeah so I think that's pretty much

4705
04:45:15,540 --> 04:45:17,760
um a reasonable overview of under a real

4706
04:45:17,760 --> 04:45:19,440
world scenario and how to use these

4707
04:45:19,440 --> 04:45:21,718
things and make a repository advice and

4708
04:45:21,718 --> 04:45:24,540
pass into attackers and just can't

4709
04:45:24,540 --> 04:45:26,100
just can't you know other Home Alone we

4710
04:45:26,100 --> 04:45:27,958
reach out everything and put your fires

4711
04:45:27,958 --> 04:45:29,218
all over the place and of course someone

4712
04:45:29,218 --> 04:45:31,560
does trip over and they're very likely

4713
04:45:31,560 --> 04:45:32,878
well

4714
04:45:32,878 --> 04:45:35,700
um cool so we just went through with our

4715
04:45:35,700 --> 04:45:37,560
three jobs that we had created the first

4716
04:45:37,560 --> 04:45:39,540
one just to recap and edit a little

4717
04:45:39,540 --> 04:45:41,878
about script inside the container as

4718
04:45:41,878 --> 04:45:43,378
soon as anything happens whether it's

4719
04:45:43,378 --> 04:45:44,940
something's executed on the path or

4720
04:45:44,940 --> 04:45:47,218
someone runs the internal even if it's a

4721
04:45:47,218 --> 04:45:48,780
you know maybe someone gets access to

4722
04:45:48,780 --> 04:45:52,080
like a channel I know and

4723
04:45:52,080 --> 04:45:54,180
uh sequence management containers just

4724
04:45:54,180 --> 04:45:55,500
running in the background maybe they

4725
04:45:55,500 --> 04:45:57,240
want to exec into it and do like an RD

4726
04:45:57,240 --> 04:46:00,120
or Burma but still getting the move so

4727
04:46:00,120 --> 04:46:03,420
that's definitely what uh

4728
04:46:03,420 --> 04:46:06,840
in terms of trying to do some Recon just

4729
04:46:06,840 --> 04:46:08,218
um once again

4730
04:46:08,218 --> 04:46:10,680
every interest how flexible these tokens

4731
04:46:10,680 --> 04:46:12,660
actually are I mean they're confused and

4732
04:46:12,660 --> 04:46:14,160
many different tasks in this case we

4733
04:46:14,160 --> 04:46:15,718
just use DMs

4734
04:46:15,718 --> 04:46:18,718
so this will manage to embed a little

4735
04:46:18,718 --> 04:46:20,638
bit of information in that alert and

4736
04:46:20,638 --> 04:46:22,740
also obviously that token tells us where

4737
04:46:22,740 --> 04:46:25,138
this came from but the second job kind

4738
04:46:25,138 --> 04:46:27,000
of speaks to the supply chain security

4739
04:46:27,000 --> 04:46:29,040
you know

4740
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:30,900
Essentials they can pretty much take

4741
04:46:30,900 --> 04:46:34,500
over the entire account so we

4742
04:46:34,500 --> 04:46:36,660
made it look like

4743
04:46:36,660 --> 04:46:38,218
a very in terms of debugging

4744
04:46:38,218 --> 04:46:40,260
accidentally like it occurred up AWS

4745
04:46:40,260 --> 04:46:42,780
credentials to console an attacker would

4746
04:46:42,780 --> 04:46:45,840
definitely want to travel is use them if

4747
04:46:45,840 --> 04:46:48,780
they were super like concerned or trying

4748
04:46:48,780 --> 04:46:53,100
to be very selfie very much if if such

4749
04:46:53,100 --> 04:46:55,440
an eight Council exists find one that

4750
04:46:55,440 --> 04:46:57,298
doesn't lock to cloudtrail which is how

4751
04:46:57,298 --> 04:47:00,440
we look for use of innovative tokens

4752
04:47:00,440 --> 04:47:02,878
even in that case we would have still

4753
04:47:02,878 --> 04:47:04,080
given the vertical because Tara

4754
04:47:04,080 --> 04:47:06,680
mentioned is a

4755
04:47:10,080 --> 04:47:12,378
foreign

4756
04:47:17,360 --> 04:47:24,320
credentials into our gitlab CR output

4757
04:47:24,900 --> 04:47:27,298
cool and then the last one is that as I

4758
04:47:27,298 --> 04:47:29,520
mentioned a few new token kubernetes

4759
04:47:29,520 --> 04:47:32,940
being pretty popular we created a Q

4760
04:47:32,940 --> 04:47:35,878
config token so that generates a

4761
04:47:35,878 --> 04:47:37,620
specific configuration for you you can

4762
04:47:37,620 --> 04:47:40,020
sprinkle it around in this case we use

4763
04:47:40,020 --> 04:47:41,700
it in our plants you can make it look

4764
04:47:41,700 --> 04:47:42,660
like

4765
04:47:42,660 --> 04:47:44,280
a customer

4766
04:47:44,280 --> 04:47:46,500
that we might deployed to in line was

4767
04:47:46,500 --> 04:47:49,440
kind of creating our effects which is

4768
04:47:49,440 --> 04:47:50,820
three and they're trying to depose some

4769
04:47:50,820 --> 04:47:52,560
sound code

4770
04:47:52,560 --> 04:47:54,780
um it does differ to other tokens and

4771
04:47:54,780 --> 04:47:56,700
that it actually repels on Mutual tier

4772
04:47:56,700 --> 04:47:58,798
list authentication so if I've done a

4773
04:47:58,798 --> 04:48:00,600
circle authenticate each other

4774
04:48:00,600 --> 04:48:03,718
um so yeah that convex is unique in that

4775
04:48:03,718 --> 04:48:06,180
the back end has to implement enough of

4776
04:48:06,180 --> 04:48:07,980
us to actually complete that negotiation

4777
04:48:07,980 --> 04:48:10,860
to the point where the qctl client

4778
04:48:10,860 --> 04:48:13,440
believes that it is talking

4779
04:48:13,440 --> 04:48:16,138
customer I've been obviously

4780
04:48:16,138 --> 04:48:18,780
and authorized but by the time we've

4781
04:48:18,780 --> 04:48:20,280
already admitted

4782
04:48:20,280 --> 04:48:23,520
and just one thing that it was an

4783
04:48:23,520 --> 04:48:24,958
interesting exercise and putting this

4784
04:48:24,958 --> 04:48:28,080
all together like we small but hit like

4785
04:48:28,080 --> 04:48:30,900
the 10 000 characters electronic bit uh

4786
04:48:30,900 --> 04:48:32,760
trying to invit the cube config in a

4787
04:48:32,760 --> 04:48:35,580
GitHub CR variable so

4788
04:48:35,580 --> 04:48:38,700
the the exercises you know how we work

4789
04:48:38,700 --> 04:48:39,840
around that

4790
04:48:39,840 --> 04:48:41,638
we're just going to look at the configs

4791
04:48:41,638 --> 04:48:43,860
or okay typically ended the ca

4792
04:48:43,860 --> 04:48:45,180
certificate

4793
04:48:45,180 --> 04:48:47,760
um but we could remove that save a

4794
04:48:47,760 --> 04:48:49,620
couple alarms and just sit like an

4795
04:48:49,620 --> 04:48:51,840
insecure until there's no very far flag

4796
04:48:51,840 --> 04:48:54,718
and so let's show up for about 3 000

4797
04:48:54,718 --> 04:48:56,760
characters and every managed to shut

4798
04:48:56,760 --> 04:48:58,860
them into the CR very well the the

4799
04:48:58,860 --> 04:49:01,260
takeaway being this was like a simple

4800
04:49:01,260 --> 04:49:03,600
stumbling block but a little bit of

4801
04:49:03,600 --> 04:49:05,280
creativity goes a long way and it's

4802
04:49:05,280 --> 04:49:08,458
super easy to work around these things

4803
04:49:08,458 --> 04:49:11,400
flexibility of these tokens and you can

4804
04:49:11,400 --> 04:49:13,138
use them in really interesting ways and

4805
04:49:13,138 --> 04:49:16,138
sort of massage them into working for

4806
04:49:16,138 --> 04:49:20,059
you in various scenarios

4807
04:49:20,340 --> 04:49:22,020
so again just going through the coupon

4808
04:49:22,020 --> 04:49:24,060
code token we just saw the present

4809
04:49:24,060 --> 04:49:25,980
environment variable and as mentioned

4810
04:49:25,980 --> 04:49:27,958
before us since we get that animal for

4811
04:49:27,958 --> 04:49:29,760
us response back it's already too late

4812
04:49:29,760 --> 04:49:31,980
we know there's an attacker using this

4813
04:49:31,980 --> 04:49:35,458
conflict and um yeah the token has done

4814
04:49:35,458 --> 04:49:38,000
with its job

4815
04:49:38,000 --> 04:49:41,600
so yeah and just moving on from that

4816
04:49:41,600 --> 04:49:45,120
there is a pretty widely distributed

4817
04:49:45,120 --> 04:49:47,820
like crc3 Matrix and

4818
04:49:47,820 --> 04:49:50,520
and it kind of gives a number of

4819
04:49:50,520 --> 04:49:52,740
scenarios with an attacker May exploit

4820
04:49:52,740 --> 04:49:54,540
your crcv system

4821
04:49:54,540 --> 04:49:56,760
how you make a compromise and the point

4822
04:49:56,760 --> 04:49:57,958
of this is not to go through everything

4823
04:49:57,958 --> 04:49:59,820
but just sort of like you know choose a

4824
04:49:59,820 --> 04:50:01,920
series according to say can we use a

4825
04:50:01,920 --> 04:50:03,780
canary tokens and some interesting way

4826
04:50:03,780 --> 04:50:04,820
to

4827
04:50:04,820 --> 04:50:07,020
avoid these situations or at least to

4828
04:50:07,020 --> 04:50:08,940
lift us on this so everything that's our

4829
04:50:08,940 --> 04:50:11,218
chain compromise of our clcd I think

4830
04:50:11,218 --> 04:50:12,718
we've recovered that pretty extensive

4831
04:50:12,718 --> 04:50:14,940
really fun

4832
04:50:14,940 --> 04:50:17,160
definitely not about it

4833
04:50:17,160 --> 04:50:18,958
um

4834
04:50:18,958 --> 04:50:21,958
Wireless injecting source code in an

4835
04:50:21,958 --> 04:50:23,638
attacker might think they need to use

4836
04:50:23,638 --> 04:50:25,440
the Vault credible we use that Vault

4837
04:50:25,440 --> 04:50:26,760
Docker container to try and sign

4838
04:50:26,760 --> 04:50:29,580
something we definitely can alert on

4839
04:50:29,580 --> 04:50:32,280
that objective code it's pretty similar

4840
04:50:32,280 --> 04:50:35,218
modifying crcd configuration and if

4841
04:50:35,218 --> 04:50:38,040
we'll get to the loss or doing workbooks

4842
04:50:38,040 --> 04:50:40,138
I mean modification to a repo so we can

4843
04:50:40,138 --> 04:50:42,958
just connect those to like a canary

4844
04:50:42,958 --> 04:50:45,600
token Ripple and we're getting alert on

4845
04:50:45,600 --> 04:50:47,340
that level again that's just kind of

4846
04:50:47,340 --> 04:50:49,020
created a few sort of existing

4847
04:50:49,020 --> 04:50:50,820
Primitives but I don't think back

4848
04:50:50,820 --> 04:50:53,040
blaster

4849
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:54,420
too

4850
04:50:54,420 --> 04:50:57,780
um but ultimately I think the the

4851
04:50:57,780 --> 04:50:59,580
takeaway is that a lot of these

4852
04:50:59,580 --> 04:51:02,298
situations can be at least

4853
04:51:02,298 --> 04:51:05,100
or made

4854
04:51:05,100 --> 04:51:06,480
um very obvious that something's

4855
04:51:06,480 --> 04:51:08,580
happening by creative use of canary

4856
04:51:08,580 --> 04:51:09,540
tokens

4857
04:51:09,540 --> 04:51:11,940
so that's uh that's all I've done the

4858
04:51:11,940 --> 04:51:13,620
CRC he's have

4859
04:51:13,620 --> 04:51:16,160
um unfortunately

4860
04:51:17,580 --> 04:51:20,940
into working the way that I wanted to

4861
04:51:20,940 --> 04:51:22,920
um yeah I think we're open to questions

4862
04:51:22,920 --> 04:51:26,400
now and uh yeah Merry Christmas and that

4863
04:51:26,400 --> 04:51:29,218
that is a line from Home Alone yeah

4864
04:51:29,218 --> 04:51:30,900
such a

4865
04:51:30,900 --> 04:51:33,560
feeling

4866
04:51:44,480 --> 04:51:48,420
it's pretty cool I'm curious so the

4867
04:51:48,420 --> 04:51:49,980
efficacy of these tokens obviously

4868
04:51:49,980 --> 04:51:52,138
depending on your back end being up

4869
04:51:52,138 --> 04:51:53,700
um but since the diapers are free how

4870
04:51:53,700 --> 04:51:56,900
sustainable is the business

4871
04:51:58,340 --> 04:52:01,020
opens the whole chat with Thanksgiving

4872
04:52:01,020 --> 04:52:02,280
and check

4873
04:52:02,280 --> 04:52:03,298
um no

4874
04:52:03,298 --> 04:52:06,240
um the back ends up all the time um if

4875
04:52:06,240 --> 04:52:07,320
you don't trust it you can go just

4876
04:52:07,320 --> 04:52:09,660
generic Canary tokens and thought oh

4877
04:52:09,660 --> 04:52:11,458
um server on the you just go to GitHub

4878
04:52:11,458 --> 04:52:14,280
pages that you can kind of apologize to

4879
04:52:14,280 --> 04:52:16,560
create your own and then the business

4880
04:52:16,560 --> 04:52:18,420
has the commercial offering has its own

4881
04:52:18,420 --> 04:52:20,458
you get your sort of single thing into

4882
04:52:20,458 --> 04:52:22,920
third console and that has its own

4883
04:52:22,920 --> 04:52:26,040
um in your ex open server yeah

4884
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:27,420
the

4885
04:52:27,420 --> 04:52:29,480
uh

4886
04:52:30,378 --> 04:52:32,340
confirm that thanks can hear he's been

4887
04:52:32,340 --> 04:52:34,200
around for a pretty long time it's well

4888
04:52:34,200 --> 04:52:35,700
known and that's uh they're just kind of

4889
04:52:35,700 --> 04:52:37,740
giving something back alongside the

4890
04:52:37,740 --> 04:52:39,420
commercial product which is

4891
04:52:39,420 --> 04:52:40,740
except for popular and

4892
04:52:40,740 --> 04:52:43,160
learning about that

4893
04:52:43,560 --> 04:52:45,660
that's that's not going away anytime

4894
04:52:45,660 --> 04:52:48,060
soon and it's uh it's a service we want

4895
04:52:48,060 --> 04:52:49,680
to keep up because it's uh you know you

4896
04:52:49,680 --> 04:52:51,120
know it helps people who helps make

4897
04:52:51,120 --> 04:52:53,458
people aware of us in the house

4898
04:52:53,458 --> 04:52:55,440
so if you don't trust

4899
04:52:55,440 --> 04:52:57,060
at least that way

4900
04:52:57,060 --> 04:52:59,780
thank you

4901
04:53:00,600 --> 04:53:02,520
um I'm wondering about sort of like a

4902
04:53:02,520 --> 04:53:04,500
you know how to use a counter attack on

4903
04:53:04,500 --> 04:53:07,138
these so what would happen if you know

4904
04:53:07,138 --> 04:53:09,240
attackers start getting more sadly and

4905
04:53:09,240 --> 04:53:12,120
recognizing the canary tokens either you

4906
04:53:12,120 --> 04:53:13,860
know so they can automatically avoid

4907
04:53:13,860 --> 04:53:14,580
them

4908
04:53:14,580 --> 04:53:17,160
and that becomes commonplace and there's

4909
04:53:17,160 --> 04:53:19,260
any way to protect against that and then

4910
04:53:19,260 --> 04:53:21,718
also is there any mitigation if that's

4911
04:53:21,718 --> 04:53:23,760
not recognizing it and you know they

4912
04:53:23,760 --> 04:53:25,920
might for example start just flatting

4913
04:53:25,920 --> 04:53:28,860
notifications in do kind of like you

4914
04:53:28,860 --> 04:53:30,660
know disguise the triggers like once

4915
04:53:30,660 --> 04:53:32,040
they've realized trigger has popped they

4916
04:53:32,040 --> 04:53:32,820
were just like

4917
04:53:32,820 --> 04:53:34,020
just like flood you with all the

4918
04:53:34,020 --> 04:53:35,520
triggers they can find so far I don't

4919
04:53:35,520 --> 04:53:36,718
need to actually see

4920
04:53:36,718 --> 04:53:39,958
which triggers our meaningful

4921
04:53:39,958 --> 04:53:42,180
yeah so there's there's definitely you

4922
04:53:42,180 --> 04:53:44,100
know a way to uncover that it's a

4923
04:53:44,100 --> 04:53:45,958
kinetic token you do Google line enough

4924
04:53:45,958 --> 04:53:48,540
to find scripts and things that can do

4925
04:53:48,540 --> 04:53:49,980
that for you so if you host your own

4926
04:53:49,980 --> 04:53:51,360
Canary token

4927
04:53:51,360 --> 04:53:53,400
server you can change that in your own

4928
04:53:53,400 --> 04:53:55,440
domain and that way it's not hosted on

4929
04:53:55,440 --> 04:53:57,958
Canary tokens.org and then it's just a

4930
04:53:57,958 --> 04:53:59,878
regular DNS traffic yeah it's going to

4931
04:53:59,878 --> 04:54:01,680
be pretty hard to distinguish that

4932
04:54:01,680 --> 04:54:04,378
that's just it's just a DNA slipper so

4933
04:54:04,378 --> 04:54:06,660
um this kind of ways to defend against

4934
04:54:06,660 --> 04:54:08,280
that and again you you come up with

4935
04:54:08,280 --> 04:54:10,378
level strategies like stacking tokens

4936
04:54:10,378 --> 04:54:12,180
like the AWS token inside the word

4937
04:54:12,180 --> 04:54:13,860
document that word document doesn't have

4938
04:54:13,860 --> 04:54:15,600
to be a canary token it can be a regular

4939
04:54:15,600 --> 04:54:18,060
document how are you going to know that

4940
04:54:18,060 --> 04:54:20,218
that's an area token so this ways around

4941
04:54:20,218 --> 04:54:21,600
that and it's only all your second

4942
04:54:21,600 --> 04:54:23,218
question was

4943
04:54:23,218 --> 04:54:26,340
over electricity like standing you with

4944
04:54:26,340 --> 04:54:28,860
with tokens uh sure I guess someone can

4945
04:54:28,860 --> 04:54:30,600
spam you with alerts

4946
04:54:30,600 --> 04:54:32,160
um but on that initial interaction

4947
04:54:32,160 --> 04:54:33,840
that's all you need right I placed a

4948
04:54:33,840 --> 04:54:35,400
stolen on box one whether you send me

4949
04:54:35,400 --> 04:54:36,718
one or a thousand dollars I don't get

4950
04:54:36,718 --> 04:54:39,120
like you touch the thing that pushed

4951
04:54:39,120 --> 04:54:41,040
over there let's go check it out okay

4952
04:54:41,040 --> 04:54:43,200
maybe just a quick question on that is

4953
04:54:43,200 --> 04:54:44,940
um is there any integration

4954
04:54:44,940 --> 04:54:46,798
um with Canary tokens to you know

4955
04:54:46,798 --> 04:54:48,360
existing sort of like in a tripwire

4956
04:54:48,360 --> 04:54:51,480
style tools uh yeah so the duty

4957
04:54:51,480 --> 04:54:53,638
detection systems like I said I'm the

4958
04:54:53,638 --> 04:54:55,440
I'm the sales guy so it's hard to me not

4959
04:54:55,440 --> 04:54:58,138
to do perfect to the commercial stuff

4960
04:54:58,138 --> 04:55:00,718
um but the with the three tokens there's

4961
04:55:00,718 --> 04:55:02,700
a weird looking email so you can go do

4962
04:55:02,700 --> 04:55:04,860
something with a web request you

4963
04:55:04,860 --> 04:55:06,298
um and then the commercial offering it

4964
04:55:06,298 --> 04:55:08,160
there's a bunch of different integration

4965
04:55:08,160 --> 04:55:10,020
options getting that into your regular

4966
04:55:10,020 --> 04:55:12,900
Sims or love collect the ticketing

4967
04:55:12,900 --> 04:55:16,638
system work whichever works over there

4968
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:22,680
are of interest that we've seen

4969
04:55:22,680 --> 04:55:26,280
the potential for malicious or these

4970
04:55:26,280 --> 04:55:28,080
actually using Canary tokens as well so

4971
04:55:28,080 --> 04:55:30,420
for instance what you see with malware

4972
04:55:30,420 --> 04:55:31,680
come

4973
04:55:31,680 --> 04:55:34,260
Railway groups actually forming proper

4974
04:55:34,260 --> 04:55:37,020
companies jira 95s that kind of thing

4975
04:55:37,020 --> 04:55:38,580
eventually you're probably going to end

4976
04:55:38,580 --> 04:55:40,320
up with therapy from

4977
04:55:40,320 --> 04:55:42,298
not that I'm saying

4978
04:55:42,298 --> 04:55:45,540
that you're it's like any tool right as

4979
04:55:45,540 --> 04:55:48,120
when you become good you you find some

4980
04:55:48,120 --> 04:55:51,958
favor right so any any thoughts on that

4981
04:55:51,958 --> 04:55:53,760
um yeah it's pretty easy like I can give

4982
04:55:53,760 --> 04:55:55,260
you how many you can bolt it or break it

4983
04:55:55,260 --> 04:55:56,638
off you know that's that's going to be

4984
04:55:56,638 --> 04:55:57,900
the case

4985
04:55:57,900 --> 04:56:01,020
um I the interesting prior to this and I

4986
04:56:01,020 --> 04:56:03,120
use tokens extensively first time around

4987
04:56:03,120 --> 04:56:04,980
upload and then get a thing back oh

4988
04:56:04,980 --> 04:56:07,200
like there's like speaking out to the

4989
04:56:07,200 --> 04:56:08,638
internet that's trying to active so yeah

4990
04:56:08,638 --> 04:56:10,920
that's there like use it either want to

4991
04:56:10,920 --> 04:56:12,360
use it use it for the right purpose but

4992
04:56:12,360 --> 04:56:14,040
don't prevent someone from taking their

4993
04:56:14,040 --> 04:56:15,540
ambulance matching the door down so

4994
04:56:15,540 --> 04:56:18,840
that's how I do

4995
04:56:18,840 --> 04:56:21,620
thank you

4996
04:56:29,940 --> 04:56:33,320
hi there thanks

4997
04:56:36,900 --> 04:56:38,700
um are they like are you successful is

4998
04:56:38,700 --> 04:56:40,740
outside of like in for safety I think we

4999
04:56:40,740 --> 04:56:42,240
want

5000
04:56:42,240 --> 04:56:43,680
um I didn't have him out of the top of

5001
04:56:43,680 --> 04:56:45,600
my head but I probably put it on the

5002
04:56:45,600 --> 04:56:48,240
slide uh just fictitiously so we do get

5003
04:56:48,240 --> 04:56:49,920
some callbacks from from law enforcement

5004
04:56:49,920 --> 04:56:51,840
I mean I'm against saying saying thanks

5005
04:56:51,840 --> 04:56:54,780
and one that I recently spoke to someone

5006
04:56:54,780 --> 04:56:56,520
about was they were teaching someone

5007
04:56:56,520 --> 04:56:58,680
about secure document practices and

5008
04:56:58,680 --> 04:57:00,958
they're using connectors as that try and

5009
04:57:00,958 --> 04:57:02,638
open the document without triggering

5010
04:57:02,638 --> 04:57:05,160
inside nothing so it's not primarily

5011
04:57:05,160 --> 04:57:06,840
used to reduce dwell time in your

5012
04:57:06,840 --> 04:57:09,298
aluminum network but this weird and

5013
04:57:09,298 --> 04:57:11,218
wonderful ways to use them and we get

5014
04:57:11,218 --> 04:57:13,440
those sort of thing back I don't have

5015
04:57:13,440 --> 04:57:16,740
the insight to share it as this you know

5016
04:57:16,740 --> 04:57:18,120
you know law enforcement agency that

5017
04:57:18,120 --> 04:57:20,218
said this on the same time but I I can

5018
04:57:20,218 --> 04:57:22,940
assure you even online

5019
04:57:23,638 --> 04:57:26,700
okay sorry we're gonna have to cut it

5020
04:57:26,700 --> 04:57:28,080
short because we'll be back in eight

5021
04:57:28,080 --> 04:57:30,180
minutes if you want a coffee or just

5022
04:57:30,180 --> 04:57:31,860
stretch your legs or catch the ball

5023
04:57:31,860 --> 04:57:34,940
through and we'll do it right now

5024
05:07:15,600 --> 05:07:19,020
uh just a quick introduction my name is

5025
05:07:19,020 --> 05:07:21,420
uh Cloud Architects a whole

5026
05:07:21,420 --> 05:07:23,180
organizations going to Cloud security

5027
05:07:23,180 --> 05:07:25,798
and you must make some like new security

5028
05:07:25,798 --> 05:07:28,920
research mainly focus on cyber security

5029
05:07:28,920 --> 05:07:31,560
topics that intercepted National

5030
05:07:31,560 --> 05:07:33,780
Security and foreign policy issues

5031
05:07:33,780 --> 05:07:35,820
things like encryption surveillance

5032
05:07:35,820 --> 05:07:38,100
privacy disinformation animation State

5033
05:07:38,100 --> 05:07:41,520
activity also involved in some policy

5034
05:07:41,520 --> 05:07:44,600
advocacy work and you can probably

5035
05:07:44,600 --> 05:07:47,820
my bloggers at criticalvoid.com

5036
05:07:47,820 --> 05:07:49,680
so in this talk we're really going to

5037
05:07:49,680 --> 05:07:51,600
kind of do a bit of retrospective of the

5038
05:07:51,600 --> 05:07:53,820
war in Ukraine we'll talk about crashes

5039
05:07:53,820 --> 05:07:56,280
that offset the use of drones and radio

5040
05:07:56,280 --> 05:07:57,740
intercept

5041
05:07:57,740 --> 05:08:00,060
the it's kind of sample all that we

5042
05:08:00,060 --> 05:08:02,280
Define this information and counter this

5043
05:08:02,280 --> 05:08:04,740
information and maybe where would we go

5044
05:08:04,740 --> 05:08:06,120
from here

5045
05:08:06,120 --> 05:08:08,458
it's a disappointing warning um there is

5046
05:08:08,458 --> 05:08:09,900
some images and videos from the

5047
05:08:09,900 --> 05:08:12,060
battlefield it's not super graphic but I

5048
05:08:12,060 --> 05:08:14,040
have been wanting to include that

5049
05:08:14,040 --> 05:08:15,840
um so the Russia Ukraine history really

5050
05:08:15,840 --> 05:08:17,760
goes all the way back to the

5051
05:08:17,760 --> 05:08:20,458
dissolvement of the Soviet Union and the

5052
05:08:20,458 --> 05:08:22,620
attention is really started to play with

5053
05:08:22,620 --> 05:08:26,520
the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and

5054
05:08:26,520 --> 05:08:29,700
last year we started to see a buildup of

5055
05:08:29,700 --> 05:08:31,320
Russian troops at the border which

5056
05:08:31,320 --> 05:08:34,020
Russia Camp was a training exercises

5057
05:08:34,020 --> 05:08:36,000
however the seller photos started to

5058
05:08:36,000 --> 05:08:38,458
show that over a hundred thousand troops

5059
05:08:38,458 --> 05:08:42,660
started to Ms at the portal and Russia

5060
05:08:42,660 --> 05:08:44,760
kept claiming that this these were

5061
05:08:44,760 --> 05:08:47,700
training exercises but this was quickly

5062
05:08:47,700 --> 05:08:49,560
disproven because they were putting up

5063
05:08:49,560 --> 05:08:51,660
Hospital tint which they typically don't

5064
05:08:51,660 --> 05:08:54,840
do during training exercises and as a

5065
05:08:54,840 --> 05:08:56,760
teacher in order to increase you know

5066
05:08:56,760 --> 05:08:59,458
the build up just continued and during

5067
05:08:59,458 --> 05:09:01,560
this process NATO uh member country

5068
05:09:01,560 --> 05:09:03,660
started moving uh vehicles and other

5069
05:09:03,660 --> 05:09:07,378
military hardware into Ukraine including

5070
05:09:07,378 --> 05:09:08,600
ammunition

5071
05:09:08,600 --> 05:09:11,160
ammunitions especially at the general

5072
05:09:11,160 --> 05:09:13,320
anti-tank missiles that are very

5073
05:09:13,320 --> 05:09:16,320
effective against Russian armor and as

5074
05:09:16,320 --> 05:09:17,878
well as other supplies that would be

5075
05:09:17,878 --> 05:09:20,360
needed for example like medical supplies

5076
05:09:20,360 --> 05:09:23,520
Taiwan for example since 27 tons of

5077
05:09:23,520 --> 05:09:26,040
supplies as well

5078
05:09:26,040 --> 05:09:28,740
in the process NATO also started putting

5079
05:09:28,740 --> 05:09:31,500
up surveillance activities in around

5080
05:09:31,500 --> 05:09:33,540
Poland to look at what was going on in

5081
05:09:33,540 --> 05:09:38,400
Belarus as well as in Ukraine and NATO

5082
05:09:38,400 --> 05:09:39,900
countries started training with the

5083
05:09:39,900 --> 05:09:42,060
Ukrainian military on how to use these

5084
05:09:42,060 --> 05:09:44,400
weapons there was Advanced Training that

5085
05:09:44,400 --> 05:09:47,400
was done in the UK and on the 24th of

5086
05:09:47,400 --> 05:09:50,100
February which was a Thursday The

5087
05:09:50,100 --> 05:09:51,900
Invasion started I remember a very

5088
05:09:51,900 --> 05:09:53,820
interestingly been working up early in

5089
05:09:53,820 --> 05:09:55,020
the morning

5090
05:09:55,020 --> 05:09:57,180
um with my friend vibrating with all of

5091
05:09:57,180 --> 05:09:59,280
the newsletter that's ever going off and

5092
05:09:59,280 --> 05:10:01,020
when I'm not going to Twitter the very

5093
05:10:01,020 --> 05:10:02,900
first video that I saw was on the left

5094
05:10:02,900 --> 05:10:06,780
with this missile going into airport in

5095
05:10:06,780 --> 05:10:08,820
eastern Ukraine and throughout the day

5096
05:10:08,820 --> 05:10:11,040
we started to see you know the first

5097
05:10:11,040 --> 05:10:14,040
casualties of what episode and one as a

5098
05:10:14,040 --> 05:10:16,020
Defender it was very concerned that we

5099
05:10:16,020 --> 05:10:18,200
were going to see cyber activity

5100
05:10:18,200 --> 05:10:20,878
given that in the world up to the wall

5101
05:10:20,878 --> 05:10:23,160
there were a considerable number of

5102
05:10:23,160 --> 05:10:26,718
deals attacks against the Ukrainian and

5103
05:10:26,718 --> 05:10:28,920
governments as well as the banking

5104
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:31,560
systems and what Russia tried to do was

5105
05:10:31,560 --> 05:10:34,440
they tried to install fearing that

5106
05:10:34,440 --> 05:10:36,180
they're going to be able to access their

5107
05:10:36,180 --> 05:10:38,100
currencies and then obviously The

5108
05:10:38,100 --> 05:10:40,320
Invasion started there was one another

5109
05:10:40,320 --> 05:10:41,580
way that was the point we'll talk about

5110
05:10:41,580 --> 05:10:43,620
that in a moment but I was really

5111
05:10:43,620 --> 05:10:45,180
concerned that we were going to see him

5112
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:47,878
not picture style attack and given that

5113
05:10:47,878 --> 05:10:50,180
one picture you know I was very

5114
05:10:50,180 --> 05:10:53,400
impactful in 2007 both in Ukraine and

5115
05:10:53,400 --> 05:10:55,860
globally thankfully nothing like that

5116
05:10:55,860 --> 05:10:58,320
happened later had actually prepared for

5117
05:10:58,320 --> 05:11:00,500
such an event so their Randy's annual

5118
05:11:00,500 --> 05:11:03,240
simulations uh called operation Rock

5119
05:11:03,240 --> 05:11:05,160
Shield where they go through these

5120
05:11:05,160 --> 05:11:08,040
simulations and you know kind of develop

5121
05:11:08,040 --> 05:11:10,378
responses for some of these activities

5122
05:11:10,378 --> 05:11:12,660
that could happen thankfully nothing

5123
05:11:12,660 --> 05:11:15,718
major could happen and I don't know why

5124
05:11:15,718 --> 05:11:17,580
you know this was the case you know is

5125
05:11:17,580 --> 05:11:19,320
it possible that Russia didn't have the

5126
05:11:19,320 --> 05:11:21,540
software capability that a lot of us

5127
05:11:21,540 --> 05:11:23,520
here that they do have or maybe they're

5128
05:11:23,520 --> 05:11:26,520
doing on a risk escalation of the West

5129
05:11:26,520 --> 05:11:29,760
what did happen though was Russia took

5130
05:11:29,760 --> 05:11:32,820
out the vice at cases

5131
05:11:32,820 --> 05:11:35,520
um this was done by Russian actors and

5132
05:11:35,520 --> 05:11:37,378
they managed to do this through a

5133
05:11:37,378 --> 05:11:39,718
missile pig at Legacy VPN at a provider

5134
05:11:39,718 --> 05:11:42,360
network uh Wagner nowhere was

5135
05:11:42,360 --> 05:11:43,458
um

5136
05:11:43,458 --> 05:11:45,780
deployed which destroyed the

5137
05:11:45,780 --> 05:11:48,298
configuration files that these terminals

5138
05:11:48,298 --> 05:11:49,740
use in order to give it back to the

5139
05:11:49,740 --> 05:11:51,780
network and at the same time the launch

5140
05:11:51,780 --> 05:11:54,120
gave us attack took place to kind of

5141
05:11:54,120 --> 05:11:55,680
distract the security team of what was

5142
05:11:55,680 --> 05:11:57,718
going on and the impact of this was

5143
05:11:57,718 --> 05:12:00,780
fairly significant so 30 000 terminals

5144
05:12:00,780 --> 05:12:04,200
went down which affected 5800 were in

5145
05:12:04,200 --> 05:12:06,298
turbines in Germany and the

5146
05:12:06,298 --> 05:12:08,820
communication systems in of Emergency

5147
05:12:08,820 --> 05:12:11,458
Services in France were also affected by

5148
05:12:11,458 --> 05:12:14,520
us it wasn't an issue clear

5149
05:12:14,520 --> 05:12:18,180
um why you know advice that people was

5150
05:12:18,180 --> 05:12:20,100
targeted but it soon became clear that

5151
05:12:20,100 --> 05:12:23,400
the real Target was the Turkish main tb2

5152
05:12:23,400 --> 05:12:25,320
drone which is used by the Ukrainian

5153
05:12:25,320 --> 05:12:28,560
military and uh typically these drones

5154
05:12:28,560 --> 05:12:31,860
operate on line of Sun so the active

5155
05:12:31,860 --> 05:12:34,680
area is fairly small but you can get a

5156
05:12:34,680 --> 05:12:36,600
module that you can plug in that

5157
05:12:36,600 --> 05:12:38,340
connects to the biasat network which

5158
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:40,798
allows these roads to be controlled

5159
05:12:40,798 --> 05:12:43,020
remotely and especially in the beginning

5160
05:12:43,020 --> 05:12:45,060
of the wall these drones were very

5161
05:12:45,060 --> 05:12:48,000
effective the military actually made a

5162
05:12:48,000 --> 05:12:50,878
music video praising the tb2 Drone as

5163
05:12:50,878 --> 05:12:52,620
well

5164
05:12:52,620 --> 05:12:55,580
so with regards to the weapon now we

5165
05:12:55,580 --> 05:12:58,200
wiper now it was actually targeted at

5166
05:12:58,200 --> 05:13:00,840
the beginning of the invasion on top of

5167
05:13:00,840 --> 05:13:02,700
government assistance Banks ATMs

5168
05:13:02,700 --> 05:13:05,760
communication systems media including TV

5169
05:13:05,760 --> 05:13:08,458
and radio as well as the Border systems

5170
05:13:08,458 --> 05:13:11,700
which was most impactful so Ukraine has

5171
05:13:11,700 --> 05:13:13,378
an identification system called the

5172
05:13:13,378 --> 05:13:16,138
noria system and this went down as a

5173
05:13:16,138 --> 05:13:19,020
result of the um the smartphone knowing

5174
05:13:19,020 --> 05:13:21,060
Caesar did put it out and alert

5175
05:13:21,060 --> 05:13:24,060
recording this and due to that system

5176
05:13:24,060 --> 05:13:27,120
being offline as people were fleeing

5177
05:13:27,120 --> 05:13:29,638
from The Invasion and they weren't able

5178
05:13:29,638 --> 05:13:32,160
to cross the border between Romania and

5179
05:13:32,160 --> 05:13:34,860
a Ukraine and eventually given the

5180
05:13:34,860 --> 05:13:37,080
humanitarian crisis that was developing

5181
05:13:37,080 --> 05:13:39,420
at the border both known over and

5182
05:13:39,420 --> 05:13:41,298
Romania started allowing people to cross

5183
05:13:41,298 --> 05:13:43,798
the border at a given with that system

5184
05:13:43,798 --> 05:13:47,638
being down and further on Microsoft CEO

5185
05:13:47,638 --> 05:13:50,160
actually stated that he considers this

5186
05:13:50,160 --> 05:13:52,080
attack the first contribution of the

5187
05:13:52,080 --> 05:13:54,900
Geneva Edition using digital means now

5188
05:13:54,900 --> 05:13:56,520
there are some people that disagree with

5189
05:13:56,520 --> 05:13:59,040
that they're just what you know he said

5190
05:13:59,040 --> 05:14:01,378
and what we need to really ask ourselves

5191
05:14:01,378 --> 05:14:04,200
is is the activity that we've seen

5192
05:14:04,200 --> 05:14:07,560
really a cyber War so the media and you

5193
05:14:07,560 --> 05:14:09,060
know certain companies have been you

5194
05:14:09,060 --> 05:14:10,260
know throwing their term around very

5195
05:14:10,260 --> 05:14:12,840
Loosely there are a lot of governments

5196
05:14:12,840 --> 05:14:14,700
on the groups on both sides that are

5197
05:14:14,700 --> 05:14:16,378
attacking one another

5198
05:14:16,378 --> 05:14:18,240
um on the Ukraine side there's a

5199
05:14:18,240 --> 05:14:20,280
hacktivist group called the Ukraine Arty

5200
05:14:20,280 --> 05:14:23,878
Army which were they started organizing

5201
05:14:23,878 --> 05:14:25,020
their events

5202
05:14:25,020 --> 05:14:25,980
um

5203
05:14:25,980 --> 05:14:28,980
uh on Telegram and in my opinion this is

5204
05:14:28,980 --> 05:14:30,540
textbook activism throughout the season

5205
05:14:30,540 --> 05:14:33,000
it's like summer Warfare and in my

5206
05:14:33,000 --> 05:14:34,500
opinion I think we need to be very

5207
05:14:34,500 --> 05:14:36,360
careful when we use the term cycle

5208
05:14:36,360 --> 05:14:38,458
Warfare and yes it is a bit of an

5209
05:14:38,458 --> 05:14:40,440
academic discussion but when something

5210
05:14:40,440 --> 05:14:42,240
isn't a rule we shouldn't be calling it

5211
05:14:42,240 --> 05:14:44,218
a war so if we go around and say

5212
05:14:44,218 --> 05:14:46,680
everything is special when real fascism

5213
05:14:46,680 --> 05:14:49,020
actually happens uh it actually loses

5214
05:14:49,020 --> 05:14:51,600
its impact so

5215
05:14:51,600 --> 05:14:54,718
um what we have seen is electricity and

5216
05:14:54,718 --> 05:14:57,298
power uh generation facilities going

5217
05:14:57,298 --> 05:14:59,760
down not because of subvertex but

5218
05:14:59,760 --> 05:15:02,638
because of uh kinetic activities

5219
05:15:02,638 --> 05:15:06,120
involving Conventional Weapons

5220
05:15:06,120 --> 05:15:09,180
so uh kind of talking about the Ukraine

5221
05:15:09,180 --> 05:15:10,620
I think one means that they attack the

5222
05:15:10,620 --> 05:15:12,180
Moscow the subject straight to the

5223
05:15:12,180 --> 05:15:14,760
largest egg in Russia Russian CRM

5224
05:15:14,760 --> 05:15:17,520
systems a mercenary Group LA Russia is

5225
05:15:17,520 --> 05:15:19,798
using as well as several government

5226
05:15:19,798 --> 05:15:21,958
institutions or compromise increasing

5227
05:15:21,958 --> 05:15:24,420
police stations uh border control

5228
05:15:24,420 --> 05:15:27,718
customs and train stations and the data

5229
05:15:27,718 --> 05:15:30,000
from these institutions to publish onto

5230
05:15:30,000 --> 05:15:32,958
DDO Secrets when you can actually go uh

5231
05:15:32,958 --> 05:15:36,060
it's a Timber a traffic jam was caused

5232
05:15:36,060 --> 05:15:39,240
by a collective effort to order a whole

5233
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:41,580
bunch of taxis on the indexes taxi

5234
05:15:41,580 --> 05:15:44,218
service to the middle of Moscow and you

5235
05:15:44,218 --> 05:15:45,480
can see that on the route of post

5236
05:15:45,480 --> 05:15:48,000
Chronicle of the traffic jam in Moscow

5237
05:15:48,000 --> 05:15:50,280
and again the question comes up you know

5238
05:15:50,280 --> 05:15:53,700
is the cyber warfare no attachivism

5239
05:15:53,700 --> 05:15:57,298
in 2015 uh Russia to detect the

5240
05:15:57,298 --> 05:15:59,280
Ukrainian power grid using the black

5241
05:15:59,280 --> 05:16:01,560
energy team help me that abused

5242
05:16:01,560 --> 05:16:04,320
automation systems that were connected

5243
05:16:04,320 --> 05:16:07,680
to scada and RCS systems and as a result

5244
05:16:07,680 --> 05:16:09,540
of this um

5245
05:16:09,540 --> 05:16:12,540
the recovery took about four hours for

5246
05:16:12,540 --> 05:16:14,878
most areas however they actually have to

5247
05:16:14,878 --> 05:16:16,560
say that people are trucks to certain

5248
05:16:16,560 --> 05:16:18,840
substations in order to deliver

5249
05:16:18,840 --> 05:16:21,240
substations back on

5250
05:16:21,240 --> 05:16:25,980
and what we saw in April was Russia

5251
05:16:25,980 --> 05:16:29,100
attacked again a the Ukrainian power

5252
05:16:29,100 --> 05:16:32,458
plant with the industria engine

5253
05:16:32,458 --> 05:16:35,218
controller malware which used a lot of

5254
05:16:35,218 --> 05:16:37,680
the Centrics that the previous RCS

5255
05:16:37,680 --> 05:16:40,378
normally has used and due to the

5256
05:16:40,378 --> 05:16:43,080
previous Etc Russia was actually able to

5257
05:16:43,080 --> 05:16:45,480
um oh sorry Ukraine was actually able to

5258
05:16:45,480 --> 05:16:48,958
kind of you know yes it took down power

5259
05:16:48,958 --> 05:16:50,638
shortly but they were able to recover

5260
05:16:50,638 --> 05:16:53,040
very quickly

5261
05:16:53,040 --> 05:16:56,280
and in this case this is of the Warfare

5262
05:16:56,280 --> 05:16:58,620
right so you have a country attacking

5263
05:16:58,620 --> 05:17:01,740
another country with Kinetic with prime

5264
05:17:01,740 --> 05:17:03,840
committed Conventional Weapons and then

5265
05:17:03,840 --> 05:17:05,700
they are also using cyber capabilities

5266
05:17:05,700 --> 05:17:07,500
to actually attack them and therefore

5267
05:17:07,500 --> 05:17:10,980
that is like proper cyber warfare

5268
05:17:10,980 --> 05:17:12,120
um just something that I would like to

5269
05:17:12,120 --> 05:17:14,218
pull it out so on the photo on the left

5270
05:17:14,218 --> 05:17:15,780
of the screen this is the first

5271
05:17:15,780 --> 05:17:17,700
technical widely on social media

5272
05:17:17,700 --> 05:17:19,740
during the

5273
05:17:19,740 --> 05:17:21,298
um not picture

5274
05:17:21,298 --> 05:17:24,840
um you know outbreak back in 2017 and on

5275
05:17:24,840 --> 05:17:27,180
the right you can see a photo five years

5276
05:17:27,180 --> 05:17:29,580
later where the same score was actually

5277
05:17:29,580 --> 05:17:31,798
hit by artillery and I think that's the

5278
05:17:31,798 --> 05:17:33,480
first time that this kind of thing has

5279
05:17:33,480 --> 05:17:34,860
ever happened

5280
05:17:34,860 --> 05:17:36,780
um a heads up to midco for pointing that

5281
05:17:36,780 --> 05:17:39,780
out and then moving on to kind of

5282
05:17:39,780 --> 05:17:42,360
Russia's opsec and the use of insecure

5283
05:17:42,360 --> 05:17:44,820
communication so Russia has been bound

5284
05:17:44,820 --> 05:17:46,620
to be using Chinese

5285
05:17:46,620 --> 05:17:49,680
um made radios that operates on the uhfa

5286
05:17:49,680 --> 05:17:52,860
of the HF frequencies and these are not

5287
05:17:52,860 --> 05:17:54,660
encrypted so anybody with the signal

5288
05:17:54,660 --> 05:17:56,340
information can listen into what's going

5289
05:17:56,340 --> 05:17:58,920
on and there are several groups in

5290
05:17:58,920 --> 05:18:00,840
Ukraine that were actually doing this so

5291
05:18:00,840 --> 05:18:02,580
they were listening to what was going on

5292
05:18:02,580 --> 05:18:04,620
Gathering their intelligence and they're

5293
05:18:04,620 --> 05:18:06,420
passing that onto the Ukrainian military

5294
05:18:06,420 --> 05:18:09,540
and as a result uh the Ukrainian

5295
05:18:09,540 --> 05:18:12,298
military was able to get the upper hand

5296
05:18:12,298 --> 05:18:14,340
on the battlefield as well as make

5297
05:18:14,340 --> 05:18:16,200
important strategic and tactical

5298
05:18:16,200 --> 05:18:17,580
decisions

5299
05:18:17,580 --> 05:18:20,638
um on you know on the battlefield

5300
05:18:20,638 --> 05:18:23,040
like we saw with the radio intercepts is

5301
05:18:23,040 --> 05:18:25,920
that the Russian military Israeli

5302
05:18:25,920 --> 05:18:28,458
disorganized is very prohibition

5303
05:18:28,458 --> 05:18:31,260
and what activist groups also started

5304
05:18:31,260 --> 05:18:33,840
doing is they started training with the

5305
05:18:33,840 --> 05:18:35,458
Russian soldiers so

5306
05:18:35,458 --> 05:18:37,860
um in in this case somebody asks for a

5307
05:18:37,860 --> 05:18:41,280
retreat and then the general applies uh

5308
05:18:41,280 --> 05:18:42,958
you know go home it's better to be a

5309
05:18:42,958 --> 05:18:45,600
dessert something fertilizer

5310
05:18:45,600 --> 05:18:47,820
the same activist groups also started

5311
05:18:47,820 --> 05:18:50,280
jamming Russian radios so they sort of

5312
05:18:50,280 --> 05:18:52,378
putting high-pitched noises on the

5313
05:18:52,378 --> 05:18:55,200
radios that creates a control faces big

5314
05:18:55,200 --> 05:18:57,060
faces and Among Us characters when you

5315
05:18:57,060 --> 05:18:59,160
put them through a spectrograph and you

5316
05:18:59,160 --> 05:19:00,840
can imagine if you're in a tank with

5317
05:19:00,840 --> 05:19:03,060
these high-pitching noises in the tank

5318
05:19:03,060 --> 05:19:05,040
on the on the radio it could be very

5319
05:19:05,040 --> 05:19:06,958
very annoying and this is very

5320
05:19:06,958 --> 05:19:08,520
interesting too many intelligence

5321
05:19:08,520 --> 05:19:11,400
analysts because Russia does actually

5322
05:19:11,400 --> 05:19:13,680
have secure capability they have the HR

5323
05:19:13,680 --> 05:19:16,138
frequency hopping radios however

5324
05:19:16,138 --> 05:19:18,900
significant corruption took place during

5325
05:19:18,900 --> 05:19:22,560
the procurement of these radios and the

5326
05:19:22,560 --> 05:19:24,360
manufacturing of the Australians was

5327
05:19:24,360 --> 05:19:26,638
given to the lowest burner so a lot of

5328
05:19:26,638 --> 05:19:28,200
them have faulty Parts but the real

5329
05:19:28,200 --> 05:19:30,360
reason why we haven't seen a lot of the

5330
05:19:30,360 --> 05:19:32,700
Australians in use is because in the

5331
05:19:32,700 --> 05:19:34,320
beginning of the war it was a training

5332
05:19:34,320 --> 05:19:37,320
exercise route so I don't even have key

5333
05:19:37,320 --> 05:19:38,820
material was actually pulled down to

5334
05:19:38,820 --> 05:19:40,798
order to support these radios in the

5335
05:19:40,798 --> 05:19:41,760
battlefield

5336
05:19:41,760 --> 05:19:43,680
what did happen at the beginning of the

5337
05:19:43,680 --> 05:19:45,718
war a specialist group of Russian

5338
05:19:45,718 --> 05:19:48,060
soldiers were actually captured

5339
05:19:48,060 --> 05:19:50,900
um with both maps and other equipment

5340
05:19:50,900 --> 05:19:55,020
including weapons as and in this example

5341
05:19:55,020 --> 05:19:57,080
you can actually see the Hazel frequency

5342
05:19:57,080 --> 05:19:59,580
there's radius thing

5343
05:19:59,580 --> 05:20:01,260
um and yes they have been found on the

5344
05:20:01,260 --> 05:20:03,180
battlefield but definitely not in in

5345
05:20:03,180 --> 05:20:05,400
what circuit use

5346
05:20:05,400 --> 05:20:07,740
Russia uses a diff a whole bunch of

5347
05:20:07,740 --> 05:20:10,138
different Radio Systems the older

5348
05:20:10,138 --> 05:20:11,820
systems are not interoperable with one

5349
05:20:11,820 --> 05:20:14,340
another and however the newer ones are

5350
05:20:14,340 --> 05:20:16,680
and they form part of a large assistant

5351
05:20:16,680 --> 05:20:19,160
so they've got vehicles that can do

5352
05:20:19,160 --> 05:20:22,378
rebroadcasting as well as a relay of

5353
05:20:22,378 --> 05:20:24,480
these signals and they also have

5354
05:20:24,480 --> 05:20:26,700
vehicles that can do digital trunk lines

5355
05:20:26,700 --> 05:20:29,940
for sorry can do trunk runs for digital

5356
05:20:29,940 --> 05:20:32,458
traffic one of the interesting findings

5357
05:20:32,458 --> 05:20:35,040
is in the radios that have been captured

5358
05:20:35,040 --> 05:20:36,900
they've actually found euresmaid chips

5359
05:20:36,900 --> 05:20:39,060
from xylex

5360
05:20:39,060 --> 05:20:41,760
um integrated silicone solution Analog

5361
05:20:41,760 --> 05:20:45,240
Devices and Texas Instruments and it

5362
05:20:45,240 --> 05:20:46,860
seems that a lot of these radios were

5363
05:20:46,860 --> 05:20:48,660
actually nearly made which actually the

5364
05:20:48,660 --> 05:20:50,940
ascensions violation so there's actually

5365
05:20:50,940 --> 05:20:53,040
investigations currently going on let's

5366
05:20:53,040 --> 05:20:55,440
actually see you know what happened

5367
05:20:55,440 --> 05:20:57,120
there

5368
05:20:57,120 --> 05:21:00,180
you know and there are also vehicles in

5369
05:21:00,180 --> 05:21:02,580
Russia's electronic warfare units um

5370
05:21:02,580 --> 05:21:04,200
that have the capability to relay

5371
05:21:04,200 --> 05:21:06,180
messages but also to do radio and GPS

5372
05:21:06,180 --> 05:21:07,378
jamming

5373
05:21:07,378 --> 05:21:08,638
um so the vehicles that you see on the

5374
05:21:08,638 --> 05:21:11,160
left part of that unit and this journey

5375
05:21:11,160 --> 05:21:14,280
was tracked by their various third

5376
05:21:14,280 --> 05:21:16,980
parties and GPS is a very important

5377
05:21:16,980 --> 05:21:19,680
thing for marine and Aviation traffic so

5378
05:21:19,680 --> 05:21:21,780
you know they were able to track that a

5379
05:21:21,780 --> 05:21:24,240
method and a correlate it very well with

5380
05:21:24,240 --> 05:21:27,180
Russian troop movement the Ukrainian

5381
05:21:27,180 --> 05:21:28,920
military actually managed to capture a

5382
05:21:28,920 --> 05:21:31,080
lot of these vehicles as well as

5383
05:21:31,080 --> 05:21:33,240
actually destroy some of them using

5384
05:21:33,240 --> 05:21:35,820
artillery and the general that looks

5385
05:21:35,820 --> 05:21:38,100
after electronic warfare was also killed

5386
05:21:38,100 --> 05:21:40,260
in the battlefield

5387
05:21:40,260 --> 05:21:42,780
so looking at the Ukrainian radio

5388
05:21:42,780 --> 05:21:44,940
systems and they have a bunch of

5389
05:21:44,940 --> 05:21:46,520
different Radio Systems including

5390
05:21:46,520 --> 05:21:49,440
systems from acid and Motorola L3 Harris

5391
05:21:49,440 --> 05:21:52,260
and battlefing and these radios were

5392
05:21:52,260 --> 05:21:54,840
provided by the nearest eight package

5393
05:21:54,840 --> 05:21:58,020
that was passed earlier this year

5394
05:21:58,020 --> 05:22:01,500
on the Motorola side they typically give

5395
05:22:01,500 --> 05:22:03,600
the higher models to commanders and

5396
05:22:03,600 --> 05:22:05,700
developer models to soldiers because

5397
05:22:05,700 --> 05:22:07,200
they don't need to be on as many

5398
05:22:07,200 --> 05:22:10,260
frequencies as the commanders need to be

5399
05:22:10,260 --> 05:22:13,260
on and at least for the Motorola systems

5400
05:22:13,260 --> 05:22:15,360
as well as the others but on the modular

5401
05:22:15,360 --> 05:22:18,360
system specifically they are secure

5402
05:22:18,360 --> 05:22:21,420
because they use DMR for prediction it's

5403
05:22:21,420 --> 05:22:23,638
encrypted with rc4 which is vulnerable

5404
05:22:23,638 --> 05:22:26,820
to flipping attacks but because the keys

5405
05:22:26,820 --> 05:22:28,980
are relatively short that can easily be

5406
05:22:28,980 --> 05:22:31,320
broken with modern computers however

5407
05:22:31,320 --> 05:22:33,120
it's not necessarily always technically

5408
05:22:33,120 --> 05:22:36,180
possible to do this on the battlefield

5409
05:22:36,180 --> 05:22:38,100
um next I wanted to look at how

5410
05:22:38,100 --> 05:22:40,378
president Celestia is communicating so

5411
05:22:40,378 --> 05:22:43,200
uh here's three different friends

5412
05:22:43,200 --> 05:22:45,180
including

5413
05:22:45,180 --> 05:22:47,520
um the phone on the top right which is

5414
05:22:47,520 --> 05:22:50,280
our old cell phone which has speed dials

5415
05:22:50,280 --> 05:22:51,660
to different government departments

5416
05:22:51,660 --> 05:22:53,700
which is not encrypted and then the

5417
05:22:53,700 --> 05:22:55,980
phone to the below that and to the left

5418
05:22:55,980 --> 05:22:59,520
is a Soviet area firm that operates on

5419
05:22:59,520 --> 05:23:01,740
the peer-to-peer Network that's not

5420
05:23:01,740 --> 05:23:03,600
encrypted but it is run around a secure

5421
05:23:03,600 --> 05:23:06,180
network so you pick it doesn't have a

5422
05:23:06,180 --> 05:23:07,860
keypad so you pick up the one side and

5423
05:23:07,860 --> 05:23:10,440
then the other side Rings Russia uses

5424
05:23:10,440 --> 05:23:11,878
the same set of range you can see in

5425
05:23:11,878 --> 05:23:14,820
this photo taken in 2012 and then a more

5426
05:23:14,820 --> 05:23:17,218
recent photo taken into Timber you can

5427
05:23:17,218 --> 05:23:20,878
see those funds on Vladimir Putin's desk

5428
05:23:20,878 --> 05:23:23,280
and we've visited zelinsky communicates

5429
05:23:23,280 --> 05:23:25,020
to other foreign leaders he typically

5430
05:23:25,020 --> 05:23:27,360
uses a commercial void phone like the

5431
05:23:27,360 --> 05:23:30,180
Empire b149 and then when he speaks to

5432
05:23:30,180 --> 05:23:33,120
the president of the United States He

5433
05:23:33,120 --> 05:23:35,340
typically uses a Cisco unified phone and

5434
05:23:35,340 --> 05:23:36,900
you can see a photo of the White House

5435
05:23:36,900 --> 05:23:40,500
on there and this is likely connected to

5436
05:23:40,500 --> 05:23:43,200
the U.S defense research Network which

5437
05:23:43,200 --> 05:23:45,718
is relayed through a local U.S embassy

5438
05:23:45,718 --> 05:23:47,878
in onye Ukraine

5439
05:23:47,878 --> 05:23:50,520
um the U.S has also provided uh

5440
05:23:50,520 --> 05:23:52,500
presidents of insiber the same iPhone as

5441
05:23:52,500 --> 05:23:54,480
well and this has allowed him to address

5442
05:23:54,480 --> 05:23:57,060
the nation as well as EU Parliament

5443
05:23:57,060 --> 05:23:59,160
which has had a moral boost in the

5444
05:23:59,160 --> 05:24:01,798
country especially during the beginning

5445
05:24:01,798 --> 05:24:04,500
of the war keeping Internet up and

5446
05:24:04,500 --> 05:24:06,360
running in Ukraine has really been a

5447
05:24:06,360 --> 05:24:08,520
hard challenge you know with all of uh

5448
05:24:08,520 --> 05:24:12,000
you know these weapons being used

5449
05:24:12,000 --> 05:24:14,340
and what some internet service providers

5450
05:24:14,340 --> 05:24:17,100
do like coach and they actually put kill

5451
05:24:17,100 --> 05:24:19,860
switches on on their Network so on in

5452
05:24:19,860 --> 05:24:23,040
the network devices so when um

5453
05:24:23,040 --> 05:24:25,440
the Russians and sort of claim the

5454
05:24:25,440 --> 05:24:27,240
territory and they were trigger the kill

5455
05:24:27,240 --> 05:24:28,680
switch and then the Russians wouldn't be

5456
05:24:28,680 --> 05:24:30,840
able to use the equipments afterwards

5457
05:24:30,840 --> 05:24:32,878
during the first weeks of the war there

5458
05:24:32,878 --> 05:24:36,660
were several Internet outages and as the

5459
05:24:36,660 --> 05:24:38,400
this evicted they've done it quite a lot

5460
05:24:38,400 --> 05:24:41,458
and as repairs started to happen uh the

5461
05:24:41,458 --> 05:24:43,980
internet traffic started to return back

5462
05:24:43,980 --> 05:24:45,240
to normal

5463
05:24:45,240 --> 05:24:47,760
um in this person which was actually one

5464
05:24:47,760 --> 05:24:50,280
of the most shocking photos of the war

5465
05:24:50,280 --> 05:24:52,620
for me is the sponsor of Hardware

5466
05:24:52,620 --> 05:24:54,900
technicians you know on the front lines

5467
05:24:54,900 --> 05:24:56,760
in a battlefield actually repairing

5468
05:24:56,760 --> 05:24:57,718
further

5469
05:24:57,718 --> 05:24:59,218
um this was quite striking to me and

5470
05:24:59,218 --> 05:25:02,760
this is another photo you know kind of

5471
05:25:02,760 --> 05:25:03,900
showing us

5472
05:25:03,900 --> 05:25:07,200
and these telecommunication uh you know

5473
05:25:07,200 --> 05:25:09,958
capabilities have really exposed some of

5474
05:25:09,958 --> 05:25:11,340
the war crimes that have been going on

5475
05:25:11,340 --> 05:25:13,440
for example in this case where uh

5476
05:25:13,440 --> 05:25:15,780
Russian armor attacks and on call which

5477
05:25:15,780 --> 05:25:18,180
actually is a war crime as well as the

5478
05:25:18,180 --> 05:25:21,120
atrocities in a future where uh you know

5479
05:25:21,120 --> 05:25:22,798
hundreds potentially thousands of people

5480
05:25:22,798 --> 05:25:26,520
were killed in execution style and

5481
05:25:26,520 --> 05:25:29,040
because of social media again with the

5482
05:25:29,040 --> 05:25:30,600
Telecommunications

5483
05:25:30,600 --> 05:25:32,760
um there are several investigations by

5484
05:25:32,760 --> 05:25:34,560
different organizations looking at the

5485
05:25:34,560 --> 05:25:37,020
war crops that are currently going on in

5486
05:25:37,020 --> 05:25:38,820
Ukraine and this has also been

5487
05:25:38,820 --> 05:25:40,200
investigated by the international

5488
05:25:40,200 --> 05:25:44,878
criminal court yeah

5489
05:25:48,360 --> 05:25:50,718
foreign

5490
05:25:51,740 --> 05:25:54,480
to get more territory and they also

5491
05:25:54,480 --> 05:25:56,218
wanted to start rerouting their traffic

5492
05:25:56,218 --> 05:25:59,638
through Russia using bgp hijacks so they

5493
05:25:59,638 --> 05:26:04,080
performed a number of large btp hijacks

5494
05:26:04,080 --> 05:26:06,540
um which had a significant impact on

5495
05:26:06,540 --> 05:26:10,080
latency and some of these attacks were

5496
05:26:10,080 --> 05:26:12,120
actually successful however some of them

5497
05:26:12,120 --> 05:26:14,940
were not due to the use of our pki so

5498
05:26:14,940 --> 05:26:16,860
many internet service providers were

5499
05:26:16,860 --> 05:26:19,798
using oppick AI which requires that bgp

5500
05:26:19,798 --> 05:26:22,620
requests to be signed and as Russia

5501
05:26:22,620 --> 05:26:25,320
started doing these attacks more ISP

5502
05:26:25,320 --> 05:26:26,820
started to about

5503
05:26:26,820 --> 05:26:27,540
um

5504
05:26:27,540 --> 05:26:29,638
and then I'll be your eyes a result of

5505
05:26:29,638 --> 05:26:30,780
that

5506
05:26:30,780 --> 05:26:33,240
um and despite the work bring down to

5507
05:26:33,240 --> 05:26:36,298
keep these teleco systems are up and

5508
05:26:36,298 --> 05:26:38,760
running and there were some dead spots

5509
05:26:38,760 --> 05:26:41,878
so Ukraine was size six for

5510
05:26:41,878 --> 05:26:43,980
um a bunch of stolen terminals which

5511
05:26:43,980 --> 05:26:45,600
were delivered to them

5512
05:26:45,600 --> 05:26:47,160
um but what was interesting to point out

5513
05:26:47,160 --> 05:26:49,620
is that one of the executive device had

5514
05:26:49,620 --> 05:26:52,378
actually publicly criticized uh starting

5515
05:26:52,378 --> 05:26:55,500
in SpaceX launched here for their

5516
05:26:55,500 --> 05:26:57,240
constellation calling that irresponsible

5517
05:26:57,240 --> 05:26:58,860
and they're given that their Network

5518
05:26:58,860 --> 05:27:00,600
went down they kind of had a bit of

5519
05:27:00,600 --> 05:27:03,420
illnesses I do want to point out that

5520
05:27:03,420 --> 05:27:06,180
Leonard good talk they've gone were kind

5521
05:27:06,180 --> 05:27:09,180
of doing a reverse kind of you know

5522
05:27:09,180 --> 05:27:10,500
reverse engineering and security

5523
05:27:10,500 --> 05:27:13,200
analysis on this learning terminal which

5524
05:27:13,200 --> 05:27:14,820
is you found to be really good you know

5525
05:27:14,820 --> 05:27:16,138
these things have really been a little

5526
05:27:16,138 --> 05:27:19,500
hardened and in his uh kind of research

5527
05:27:19,500 --> 05:27:21,900
he wanted to get access which he managed

5528
05:27:21,900 --> 05:27:25,080
to do through the uh you want port and

5529
05:27:25,080 --> 05:27:27,120
he disclosed this this Basics as a

5530
05:27:27,120 --> 05:27:29,280
product Security Internet response team

5531
05:27:29,280 --> 05:27:32,820
and they basically pushed out new

5532
05:27:32,820 --> 05:27:36,060
firmware which grew the if users on the

5533
05:27:36,060 --> 05:27:39,180
on Esports and then just to mention he's

5534
05:27:39,180 --> 05:27:41,820
doing quite a bit of other cool research

5535
05:27:41,820 --> 05:27:44,820
looking at various voltage and pitching

5536
05:27:44,820 --> 05:27:47,520
attacks including building his own SOC

5537
05:27:47,520 --> 05:27:50,520
to achieve some of these attacks

5538
05:27:50,520 --> 05:27:52,080
attack so moving on to Russian

5539
05:27:52,080 --> 05:27:54,360
disinformation so in the Russian

5540
05:27:54,360 --> 05:27:56,940
Doctrine the Russian military is

5541
05:27:56,940 --> 05:27:59,218
organized into five different kind of

5542
05:27:59,218 --> 05:28:02,280
units or divisions including the

5543
05:28:02,280 --> 05:28:04,560
military Oceanic Aerospace nuclear

5544
05:28:04,560 --> 05:28:06,540
forces and strategic operations for

5545
05:28:06,540 --> 05:28:09,240
critical targets and as part of this

5546
05:28:09,240 --> 05:28:11,040
Doctrine Russia wants to use information

5547
05:28:11,040 --> 05:28:14,400
Warfare to plant and spread false

5548
05:28:14,400 --> 05:28:16,320
narratives to mislead misdirect and

5549
05:28:16,320 --> 05:28:17,520
confuse people

5550
05:28:17,520 --> 05:28:21,420
so in the heat up to the Crimea the

5551
05:28:21,420 --> 05:28:23,600
annexation of Crimea and following that

5552
05:28:23,600 --> 05:28:25,740
Russia had several disinformation

5553
05:28:25,740 --> 05:28:27,958
campaigns that they were using and then

5554
05:28:27,958 --> 05:28:29,638
when the invasion stopped there were

5555
05:28:29,638 --> 05:28:32,820
over 300 different false narratives that

5556
05:28:32,820 --> 05:28:34,378
pressure was putting I'm not going to go

5557
05:28:34,378 --> 05:28:36,060
through all of them and they put that

5558
05:28:36,060 --> 05:28:37,680
quite quite some time with the Israeli

5559
05:28:37,680 --> 05:28:39,840
what I'm trying to show you is like the

5560
05:28:39,840 --> 05:28:42,480
amount of false narratives is a very

5561
05:28:42,480 --> 05:28:44,458
very fast

5562
05:28:44,458 --> 05:28:46,920
um one of these false narratives is the

5563
05:28:46,920 --> 05:28:48,958
history of Russia and the Soviet Union

5564
05:28:48,958 --> 05:28:51,060
so the Russian government especially

5565
05:28:51,060 --> 05:28:53,760
Vladimir Putin is really working hard to

5566
05:28:53,760 --> 05:28:56,520
try and rewrite the history and Memorial

5567
05:28:56,520 --> 05:28:59,298
which is Russia's oldest human rights

5568
05:28:59,298 --> 05:29:02,940
organization was actually ordered by a

5569
05:29:02,940 --> 05:29:06,000
Russian judge to be liquidated at the

5570
05:29:06,000 --> 05:29:09,020
beginning of this war and Memorial keeps

5571
05:29:09,020 --> 05:29:12,000
documents and artifacts that show the

5572
05:29:12,000 --> 05:29:15,500
atrocities that occurred under stolen

5573
05:29:15,500 --> 05:29:18,718
memorials that were created to uh you

5574
05:29:18,718 --> 05:29:20,760
know remember those lost to solvents

5575
05:29:20,760 --> 05:29:23,280
actions are also being taken down and

5576
05:29:23,280 --> 05:29:25,920
new murals have been created on several

5577
05:29:25,920 --> 05:29:28,020
buildings like the one on the runs which

5578
05:29:28,020 --> 05:29:30,360
is actually created uh I recall the

5579
05:29:30,360 --> 05:29:32,520
opposite of the Kremlin so it's not even

5580
05:29:32,520 --> 05:29:35,040
like subtle that they're trying to do

5581
05:29:35,040 --> 05:29:37,740
and then obviously the use of social

5582
05:29:37,740 --> 05:29:40,138
media for this disinformation campaigns

5583
05:29:40,138 --> 05:29:43,218
you know has been you know used quite

5584
05:29:43,218 --> 05:29:46,740
widely I tried to do a very rudimentary

5585
05:29:46,740 --> 05:29:49,920
analysis so in July I actually managed

5586
05:29:49,920 --> 05:29:51,660
to identify at least eight thousand

5587
05:29:51,660 --> 05:29:54,240
accounts that were involved in this kind

5588
05:29:54,240 --> 05:29:56,458
of disinformation campaign I should

5589
05:29:56,458 --> 05:29:58,680
mention that the data is not like 100

5590
05:29:58,680 --> 05:30:01,860
clean these are just observations that I

5591
05:30:01,860 --> 05:30:04,020
made and then the second time I did this

5592
05:30:04,020 --> 05:30:06,480
analysis I was able to identify 12 000

5593
05:30:06,480 --> 05:30:08,700
accounts but unfortunately I lost my

5594
05:30:08,700 --> 05:30:10,680
first data set because I didn't change

5595
05:30:10,680 --> 05:30:12,900
the upward file number in our around my

5596
05:30:12,900 --> 05:30:15,500
scripts like online but nevertheless

5597
05:30:15,500 --> 05:30:19,040
what I also observed was their Bots

5598
05:30:19,040 --> 05:30:22,980
would engage with a content posted by a

5599
05:30:22,980 --> 05:30:25,500
Russian government officials as well as

5600
05:30:25,500 --> 05:30:28,458
other influencers and unfortunately

5601
05:30:28,458 --> 05:30:31,680
since Elon has taken over the Twitter

5602
05:30:31,680 --> 05:30:35,458
API is not behaving as it has most

5603
05:30:35,458 --> 05:30:37,260
because I wanted to take some

5604
05:30:37,260 --> 05:30:39,600
inspiration from Rudolph's not very good

5605
05:30:39,600 --> 05:30:43,080
at hexagon to kind of you know see if I

5606
05:30:43,080 --> 05:30:45,420
could see anything else unfortunately

5607
05:30:45,420 --> 05:30:47,280
not

5608
05:30:47,280 --> 05:30:50,040
so one of the narratives as well is this

5609
05:30:50,040 --> 05:30:52,200
thing of Russian aggressions or Austria

5610
05:30:52,200 --> 05:30:54,000
Russia was putting pushing this

5611
05:30:54,000 --> 05:30:55,740
narrative that they're not aggressive

5612
05:30:55,740 --> 05:30:57,060
and then this year they want to go

5613
05:30:57,060 --> 05:31:00,000
liberate Ukraine which obviously

5614
05:31:00,000 --> 05:31:03,560
requires aggression what the

5615
05:31:03,560 --> 05:31:06,200
Ukrainian electricals have found a

5616
05:31:06,200 --> 05:31:09,000
confiscated ten thousand sub quotes they

5617
05:31:09,000 --> 05:31:11,400
put parts of our Russian platforms to

5618
05:31:11,400 --> 05:31:12,860
spread this information

5619
05:31:12,860 --> 05:31:15,900
and the use of telegram is also quite

5620
05:31:15,900 --> 05:31:18,718
pervasive so there are literally

5621
05:31:18,718 --> 05:31:21,660
hundreds of telegram channels where this

5622
05:31:21,660 --> 05:31:23,400
this information is being posted for

5623
05:31:23,400 --> 05:31:27,060
Russian citizens and because of the fact

5624
05:31:27,060 --> 05:31:28,620
that it's on telegram it can't be since

5625
05:31:28,620 --> 05:31:31,138
a participles on Twitter like toilet

5626
05:31:31,138 --> 05:31:33,840
could take action against it and these

5627
05:31:33,840 --> 05:31:35,638
these channels have enormous followings

5628
05:31:35,638 --> 05:31:39,480
like I've seen some with 10 100 000 even

5629
05:31:39,480 --> 05:31:42,240
millions of followers and the average

5630
05:31:42,240 --> 05:31:45,298
post gets around 500 000 views

5631
05:31:45,298 --> 05:31:48,260
as a result of that one of the other

5632
05:31:48,260 --> 05:31:51,718
campaigns that happened was is the EU

5633
05:31:51,718 --> 05:31:55,378
announced a package for uh to provide

5634
05:31:55,378 --> 05:31:57,900
additional systems to Ukraine and within

5635
05:31:57,900 --> 05:32:00,000
one day of the announcement there was

5636
05:32:00,000 --> 05:32:02,218
already a Russian the super Mission

5637
05:32:02,218 --> 05:32:05,280
campaign targeting um the validity of

5638
05:32:05,280 --> 05:32:07,440
this assistant and it was then posted

5639
05:32:07,440 --> 05:32:09,780
over a hundred telegram channels and

5640
05:32:09,780 --> 05:32:11,700
it's one of social media accounts of

5641
05:32:11,700 --> 05:32:14,940
various Russian diplomats and diplomatic

5642
05:32:14,940 --> 05:32:17,400
channels as well

5643
05:32:17,400 --> 05:32:19,860
um when volunteer Fighters went to a

5644
05:32:19,860 --> 05:32:22,260
Ukraine's a department for Ukraine and

5645
05:32:22,260 --> 05:32:25,320
there was this information Target uh a

5646
05:32:25,320 --> 05:32:29,100
campaign targeting them as well as a

5647
05:32:29,100 --> 05:32:31,440
disinformation campaign that launched

5648
05:32:31,440 --> 05:32:34,680
the win and the Embassy in New York City

5649
05:32:34,680 --> 05:32:37,020
was actually vandalized and one of the

5650
05:32:37,020 --> 05:32:39,060
counter narratives There Was You know

5651
05:32:39,060 --> 05:32:41,040
the building wasn't vandalized it's just

5652
05:32:41,040 --> 05:32:42,600
blushing that there's the embassy inside

5653
05:32:42,600 --> 05:32:45,000
of it

5654
05:32:45,000 --> 05:32:47,340
and then when similar attacks have been

5655
05:32:47,340 --> 05:32:50,400
in Germany and Ireland Russia very good

5656
05:32:50,400 --> 05:32:52,680
peoples the victim called

5657
05:32:52,680 --> 05:32:54,540
um to kind of

5658
05:32:54,540 --> 05:32:56,218
compound that with the disinformation

5659
05:32:56,218 --> 05:32:58,560
campaigns that they're doing the

5660
05:32:58,560 --> 05:33:01,740
Ukrainian military also runs Army FM and

5661
05:33:01,740 --> 05:33:04,980
this is a way to broadcast the grids

5662
05:33:04,980 --> 05:33:06,420
like what's happening in the correct

5663
05:33:06,420 --> 05:33:08,700
information especially in some of the

5664
05:33:08,700 --> 05:33:11,100
captured areas Russia has been trying to

5665
05:33:11,100 --> 05:33:13,860
jam the Israelis stations

5666
05:33:13,860 --> 05:33:16,200
um but Ukraine military that's on the

5667
05:33:16,200 --> 05:33:18,060
front lines is actually rebroad costing

5668
05:33:18,060 --> 05:33:20,458
some of these um signals to try to get

5669
05:33:20,458 --> 05:33:22,680
you know that across into the captured

5670
05:33:22,680 --> 05:33:24,260
areas

5671
05:33:24,260 --> 05:33:26,820
Russia has had heavy losses on the

5672
05:33:26,820 --> 05:33:29,820
battlefields and before the war the Army

5673
05:33:29,820 --> 05:33:31,740
was you know significantly larger than

5674
05:33:31,740 --> 05:33:33,840
Ukraine's I mean even if you take into

5675
05:33:33,840 --> 05:33:36,060
consideration the weapons that were

5676
05:33:36,060 --> 05:33:39,180
provided by Nature countries they really

5677
05:33:39,180 --> 05:33:41,040
should have won the war but I think this

5678
05:33:41,040 --> 05:33:43,020
was a massive miscalculation on behalf

5679
05:33:43,020 --> 05:33:45,180
of Britain and I think the bad

5680
05:33:45,180 --> 05:33:47,400
leadership uh United will show you the

5681
05:33:47,400 --> 05:33:49,980
moment like really shows the you know

5682
05:33:49,980 --> 05:33:51,540
the reason why they haven't seen the

5683
05:33:51,540 --> 05:33:53,100
success that they probably should have

5684
05:33:53,100 --> 05:33:55,280
seen

5685
05:33:55,320 --> 05:33:57,480
um Russia's useful idiot and it's on by

5686
05:33:57,480 --> 05:33:59,638
lukashenko who's the president of

5687
05:33:59,638 --> 05:34:02,638
Belarus actually went on live TV and

5688
05:34:02,638 --> 05:34:05,040
actually literally like with the plan of

5689
05:34:05,040 --> 05:34:07,080
what they were trying to do like how

5690
05:34:07,080 --> 05:34:09,780
stupid can you be and then this famous

5691
05:34:09,780 --> 05:34:11,700
photo that you know was also shared on

5692
05:34:11,700 --> 05:34:13,320
social media quite a lot so you just see

5693
05:34:13,320 --> 05:34:16,860
a Russian armor and other vehicles you

5694
05:34:16,860 --> 05:34:19,560
know in this massive line

5695
05:34:19,560 --> 05:34:22,458
um this really shows the ProLogistix of

5696
05:34:22,458 --> 05:34:26,820
the Russian military and this was the

5697
05:34:26,820 --> 05:34:28,500
result of this communication as well as

5698
05:34:28,500 --> 05:34:30,600
lack of leadership and I should mention

5699
05:34:30,600 --> 05:34:33,298
that this was actually due to a Cyber

5700
05:34:33,298 --> 05:34:36,718
attack that was on the Belarusian rail

5701
05:34:36,718 --> 05:34:39,060
system it wasn't the only reason but

5702
05:34:39,060 --> 05:34:41,878
like I did play into this

5703
05:34:41,878 --> 05:34:45,480
and what we also saw is um you know just

5704
05:34:45,480 --> 05:34:47,100
the failure of Russian to the energy

5705
05:34:47,100 --> 05:34:49,920
supplied strips so NATO uses a

5706
05:34:49,920 --> 05:34:52,320
pool-based system so units on the

5707
05:34:52,320 --> 05:34:54,060
battlefield can request items and then

5708
05:34:54,060 --> 05:34:56,580
it sent to them Russia uses a push-based

5709
05:34:56,580 --> 05:34:57,718
system so

5710
05:34:57,718 --> 05:34:59,820
um their average where people need uh

5711
05:34:59,820 --> 05:35:01,440
you know what if they need and they send

5712
05:35:01,440 --> 05:35:04,260
that to them and what this leads to is

5713
05:35:04,260 --> 05:35:06,718
both oversupply and under supply of

5714
05:35:06,718 --> 05:35:10,440
items which is not great and recently

5715
05:35:10,440 --> 05:35:12,900
Russia hasn't been able to provide socks

5716
05:35:12,900 --> 05:35:15,780
to um at soldiers and then if we use

5717
05:35:15,780 --> 05:35:17,458
these pieces of cloth Sport and

5718
05:35:17,458 --> 05:35:19,860
identities and you know what does it say

5719
05:35:19,860 --> 05:35:21,240
about your military when you point it

5720
05:35:21,240 --> 05:35:23,458
even provide salts to your

5721
05:35:23,458 --> 05:35:26,040
um you know your soldiers and there's

5722
05:35:26,040 --> 05:35:27,718
this like kind of thing the same you

5723
05:35:27,718 --> 05:35:29,820
know amateurs think about tactics uh

5724
05:35:29,820 --> 05:35:32,218
professionals think about logistics

5725
05:35:32,218 --> 05:35:35,040
we've also seen a bad behavior and we're

5726
05:35:35,040 --> 05:35:38,878
discipline on the radius on the you know

5727
05:35:38,878 --> 05:35:40,620
from the Russian military you see a tank

5728
05:35:40,620 --> 05:35:42,840
you know driving into Street poles

5729
05:35:42,840 --> 05:35:44,340
um each time that does this obviously it

5730
05:35:44,340 --> 05:35:47,400
affects the accuracy of the turret

5731
05:35:47,400 --> 05:35:49,798
um as well as you know Ukrainian farmers

5732
05:35:49,798 --> 05:35:52,440
are telling me away Russian armor that

5733
05:35:52,440 --> 05:35:55,080
has been captured and this hasn't gone

5734
05:35:55,080 --> 05:35:58,138
down very well in in Russia so there's a

5735
05:35:58,138 --> 05:35:59,638
Russian saying

5736
05:35:59,638 --> 05:36:01,138
um which translates it into English

5737
05:36:01,138 --> 05:36:04,260
which is a Sonos group boys are bad boys

5738
05:36:04,260 --> 05:36:06,060
of the tallest there's also you know it

5739
05:36:06,060 --> 05:36:08,458
doesn't really rolled into English but

5740
05:36:08,458 --> 05:36:10,020
effectively what they're saying is you

5741
05:36:10,020 --> 05:36:12,000
don't protest our soul which is uh

5742
05:36:12,000 --> 05:36:14,760
President Putin you criticize the people

5743
05:36:14,760 --> 05:36:17,218
who are in charge of implementing his

5744
05:36:17,218 --> 05:36:21,480
decision which are the Russian generals

5745
05:36:21,480 --> 05:36:24,240
so what has happened on telegram with a

5746
05:36:24,240 --> 05:36:27,060
lot of these uh you know influences

5747
05:36:27,060 --> 05:36:29,458
they've had been pushing this you know

5748
05:36:29,458 --> 05:36:31,860
narrative that the Russian generals are

5749
05:36:31,860 --> 05:36:34,500
doing a really bad job and a linguistic

5750
05:36:34,500 --> 05:36:37,860
analysis on this has actually shown that

5751
05:36:37,860 --> 05:36:40,200
um these people are not actually writing

5752
05:36:40,200 --> 05:36:42,540
uh this is this is actually coming from

5753
05:36:42,540 --> 05:36:44,580
the criminal so the Kremlin is watching

5754
05:36:44,580 --> 05:36:46,440
this message along and the influencers

5755
05:36:46,440 --> 05:36:48,600
or or bossing that along

5756
05:36:48,600 --> 05:36:53,400
but also happened was uh the memes are

5757
05:36:53,400 --> 05:36:56,160
starting to be used in in the war and

5758
05:36:56,160 --> 05:36:59,100
this is you know being a way to kind of

5759
05:36:59,100 --> 05:37:02,520
fun at Russia and mutant and I'm showing

5760
05:37:02,520 --> 05:37:04,920
English names here but there are memes

5761
05:37:04,920 --> 05:37:07,620
in Russian as well typically the memes

5762
05:37:07,620 --> 05:37:10,378
are created in both English and Russia

5763
05:37:10,378 --> 05:37:13,500
um for at least some of them and this is

5764
05:37:13,500 --> 05:37:16,260
very effective when uh to highlight the

5765
05:37:16,260 --> 05:37:17,820
achievements on the battlefield so in

5766
05:37:17,820 --> 05:37:20,878
this case you see Russia

5767
05:37:20,878 --> 05:37:23,638
um so when the Ukraine attacked Crimea

5768
05:37:23,638 --> 05:37:25,500
you know there's a meme making fun of

5769
05:37:25,500 --> 05:37:28,620
course probably you know excellent when

5770
05:37:28,620 --> 05:37:30,540
they're attacking Air Base you know the

5771
05:37:30,540 --> 05:37:33,298
same thing when Russian soldiers started

5772
05:37:33,298 --> 05:37:35,760
taking trenches at Chernobyl which is a

5773
05:37:35,760 --> 05:37:37,798
radiologically active you know making

5774
05:37:37,798 --> 05:37:40,440
fun of that situation as well when the

5775
05:37:40,440 --> 05:37:42,420
UK prime minister visited as well as

5776
05:37:42,420 --> 05:37:43,980
like you know I think you need to send

5777
05:37:43,980 --> 05:37:46,440
the missile to your key from when I'm

5778
05:37:46,440 --> 05:37:50,420
there there's also a Russian

5779
05:37:57,860 --> 05:38:02,218
and when a Ukraine um got you know

5780
05:38:02,218 --> 05:38:04,080
liberated a kiss on you know it's like

5781
05:38:04,080 --> 05:38:05,760
well this is the worst day of the war

5782
05:38:05,760 --> 05:38:07,740
it's like well now it's the worst day of

5783
05:38:07,740 --> 05:38:10,080
the Utes at home

5784
05:38:10,080 --> 05:38:12,780
as Russia started to retreat the left

5785
05:38:12,780 --> 05:38:16,740
amount of ammunition around and Ukraine

5786
05:38:16,740 --> 05:38:18,420
was able to use that ammunition to

5787
05:38:18,420 --> 05:38:21,420
actually Target Russian soldiers and you

5788
05:38:21,420 --> 05:38:23,160
know game making fun of the fact that

5789
05:38:23,160 --> 05:38:26,218
Russia is probably your friends not just

5790
05:38:26,218 --> 05:38:29,878
on the supplier and this is one of my uh

5791
05:38:29,878 --> 05:38:32,878
favorites um this is a non-traditional

5792
05:38:32,878 --> 05:38:36,420
soldier that shot down a helicopter and

5793
05:38:36,420 --> 05:38:38,340
then a whole bunch of memes were posted

5794
05:38:38,340 --> 05:38:40,440
as a result of this but the reason why

5795
05:38:40,440 --> 05:38:42,780
it's my favorite is because so many

5796
05:38:42,780 --> 05:38:45,360
Russians like absolutely lost their mind

5797
05:38:45,360 --> 05:38:46,980
with this meme

5798
05:38:46,980 --> 05:38:49,020
um so yeah and then there was another

5799
05:38:49,020 --> 05:38:51,840
video from a Russian State journalist

5800
05:38:51,840 --> 05:38:53,760
who was reporting you know from the

5801
05:38:53,760 --> 05:38:56,580
front lines and then he got knocked over

5802
05:38:56,580 --> 05:38:59,520
from the boss when the artillery went

5803
05:38:59,520 --> 05:39:01,378
off

5804
05:39:01,378 --> 05:39:03,600
um several Russian generals were

5805
05:39:03,600 --> 05:39:05,340
actually killed both one Stock and Two

5806
05:39:05,340 --> 05:39:07,680
star generals and as I mentioned at the

5807
05:39:07,680 --> 05:39:09,240
beginning of the talk

5808
05:39:09,240 --> 05:39:12,718
um the uh the the general that's in

5809
05:39:12,718 --> 05:39:15,060
charge of electronic warfare was also

5810
05:39:15,060 --> 05:39:17,400
killed uh as well and then again

5811
05:39:17,400 --> 05:39:21,240
meetings making fun of that fact

5812
05:39:21,240 --> 05:39:23,458
um a lot of old equipments from World

5813
05:39:23,458 --> 05:39:25,200
War one and World War II have been

5814
05:39:25,200 --> 05:39:27,240
observed on the battlefield including

5815
05:39:27,240 --> 05:39:31,440
the MP40 as well as various rifles the

5816
05:39:31,440 --> 05:39:33,298
maximum machine gun from World War one

5817
05:39:33,298 --> 05:39:35,638
was found on the battlefield by

5818
05:39:35,638 --> 05:39:38,040
Ukrainian soldiers so these are Russian

5819
05:39:38,040 --> 05:39:40,620
weapons found by Ukrainian soldiers and

5820
05:39:40,620 --> 05:39:42,360
then in this video you can kind of see

5821
05:39:42,360 --> 05:39:46,320
the kind of contrast between the 21st

5822
05:39:46,320 --> 05:39:48,240
century weapons that Ukraine is using

5823
05:39:48,240 --> 05:39:50,400
versus the world war one weapons that

5824
05:39:50,400 --> 05:39:53,100
some Russian soldiers are using and

5825
05:39:53,100 --> 05:39:54,718
despite all of the weapon systems

5826
05:39:54,718 --> 05:39:57,600
provided to Ukraine from NATO

5827
05:39:57,600 --> 05:40:00,360
um they still needed funding to get

5828
05:40:00,360 --> 05:40:02,520
other equipment that they needed so they

5829
05:40:02,520 --> 05:40:04,400
started a project called San Javelin

5830
05:40:04,400 --> 05:40:09,120
which was uh aimed to raise funds to get

5831
05:40:09,120 --> 05:40:10,320
these

5832
05:40:10,320 --> 05:40:11,940
um and obviously praising the

5833
05:40:11,940 --> 05:40:13,680
enchantment system which has been very

5834
05:40:13,680 --> 05:40:15,958
effective against Russia Palmer so they

5835
05:40:15,958 --> 05:40:18,298
put this on merch they painted a lot of

5836
05:40:18,298 --> 05:40:21,060
buildings they sell sold artwork for up

5837
05:40:21,060 --> 05:40:23,520
to seventy thousand dollars they put

5838
05:40:23,520 --> 05:40:25,020
that on t-shirts which they gave to

5839
05:40:25,020 --> 05:40:28,160
presidents and then ski as well as the

5840
05:40:28,160 --> 05:40:32,040
defense minister of Estonia and a

5841
05:40:32,040 --> 05:40:35,940
Russian su-34 Jets actually shut down

5842
05:40:35,940 --> 05:40:38,160
um so what they did is they made key

5843
05:40:38,160 --> 05:40:41,700
holders solid events from the egg the

5844
05:40:41,700 --> 05:40:43,680
skin of the aircraft and then started

5845
05:40:43,680 --> 05:40:46,080
selling that and I love the attack line

5846
05:40:46,080 --> 05:40:47,940
you know made in Russia recycled in

5847
05:40:47,940 --> 05:40:50,480
Ukraine

5848
05:40:51,120 --> 05:40:53,700
and and what people said is they had a

5849
05:40:53,700 --> 05:40:55,560
website where you could actually pay to

5850
05:40:55,560 --> 05:40:59,520
have messages put on munition so for 200

5851
05:40:59,520 --> 05:41:03,180
you can have a message written on the

5852
05:41:03,180 --> 05:41:06,060
shelf for 700 you can have the ticks put

5853
05:41:06,060 --> 05:41:09,660
on an exam Excalibur weather

5854
05:41:09,660 --> 05:41:11,218
um and these are just some examples of

5855
05:41:11,218 --> 05:41:13,798
that for thirty thousand dollars you can

5856
05:41:13,798 --> 05:41:17,340
put stickers on the su-24 jet

5857
05:41:17,340 --> 05:41:19,138
um and there was even a marriage

5858
05:41:19,138 --> 05:41:21,360
proposal so somebody paid to have ticks

5859
05:41:21,360 --> 05:41:22,920
going on which I thought is a little bit

5860
05:41:22,920 --> 05:41:27,079
threatening you know what it enemies now

5861
05:41:28,040 --> 05:41:31,080
and then this is a bug system so for

5862
05:41:31,080 --> 05:41:33,420
those of you that don't know about a

5863
05:41:33,420 --> 05:41:36,298
system was used to shoot down a airplane

5864
05:41:36,298 --> 05:41:40,980
in a Malaysian Enron uh plan because

5865
05:41:40,980 --> 05:41:42,718
it's kind of making you know a lot of

5866
05:41:42,718 --> 05:41:44,218
better situation

5867
05:41:44,218 --> 05:41:46,440
they raised over a million dollars over

5868
05:41:46,440 --> 05:41:49,020
screenshot this whole family and they've

5869
05:41:49,020 --> 05:41:50,878
received you know you know a lot of

5870
05:41:50,878 --> 05:41:52,860
funding as a result of this and it has

5871
05:41:52,860 --> 05:41:54,660
also boosted the morale of the soldiers

5872
05:41:54,660 --> 05:41:56,458
because obviously they see that you know

5873
05:41:56,458 --> 05:41:58,740
other people are holding them and with

5874
05:41:58,740 --> 05:42:00,540
that funding they were able to purchase

5875
05:42:00,540 --> 05:42:03,000
uh call Strands omelet face sleeping

5876
05:42:03,000 --> 05:42:05,878
bags uh Power Banks radios and warnings

5877
05:42:05,878 --> 05:42:07,620
and

5878
05:42:07,620 --> 05:42:10,200
as well as drones which they spent most

5879
05:42:10,200 --> 05:42:12,180
of the money on and so what they've been

5880
05:42:12,180 --> 05:42:13,740
doing is instead of using the

5881
05:42:13,740 --> 05:42:15,780
conventional drones they've been using

5882
05:42:15,780 --> 05:42:18,420
consumer trends like the DJ alnavic and

5883
05:42:18,420 --> 05:42:19,740
they're building the special harness

5884
05:42:19,740 --> 05:42:22,020
under the Drone to actually release

5885
05:42:22,020 --> 05:42:24,420
grenades from the air and the way that

5886
05:42:24,420 --> 05:42:26,760
they do this is they put a sense from

5887
05:42:26,760 --> 05:42:29,580
The Landing lamp so

5888
05:42:29,580 --> 05:42:31,138
um because the landing light can't be

5889
05:42:31,138 --> 05:42:32,878
controlled remotely via the smartphone

5890
05:42:32,878 --> 05:42:35,340
app and the controller and they can put

5891
05:42:35,340 --> 05:42:37,980
the you know this harness and their

5892
05:42:37,980 --> 05:42:41,218
methods and then use the light to

5893
05:42:41,218 --> 05:42:43,378
remotely trigger it to fall down

5894
05:42:43,378 --> 05:42:45,420
so that's an example of what that looks

5895
05:42:45,420 --> 05:42:48,298
like and this is first used in Iraq in

5896
05:42:48,298 --> 05:42:52,200
2017 with a secret boot Fitters at the

5897
05:42:52,200 --> 05:42:54,000
at the back of it to add a bit of

5898
05:42:54,000 --> 05:42:57,120
stability and this has proven to be very

5899
05:42:57,120 --> 05:42:59,878
useful at disabling Russian tanks so in

5900
05:42:59,878 --> 05:43:02,218
this situation you have you know a few

5901
05:43:02,218 --> 05:43:04,798
hundred dollars a drone protecting after

5902
05:43:04,798 --> 05:43:08,120
multi-million dollar attack

5903
05:43:08,280 --> 05:43:09,780
um I'm not showing you the more graphic

5904
05:43:09,780 --> 05:43:13,200
uh videos but there are videos of these

5905
05:43:13,200 --> 05:43:15,840
Giants flying over foxholes and then

5906
05:43:15,840 --> 05:43:17,820
they droplets and then obviously a whole

5907
05:43:17,820 --> 05:43:19,860
bunch of Russian soldiers are killed in

5908
05:43:19,860 --> 05:43:20,940
the process

5909
05:43:20,940 --> 05:43:24,060
so the Ukrainian military has asked for

5910
05:43:24,060 --> 05:43:25,620
donations of these drones and have

5911
05:43:25,620 --> 05:43:27,780
received them and then these are just

5912
05:43:27,780 --> 05:43:31,680
some pictures of the various deliveries

5913
05:43:31,680 --> 05:43:33,718
um if anybody knows why they prefer the

5914
05:43:33,718 --> 05:43:35,700
orange drones as opposed to the gray

5915
05:43:35,700 --> 05:43:38,100
Zone trains I would love to hear your

5916
05:43:38,100 --> 05:43:40,138
opinion High spend so much time trying

5917
05:43:40,138 --> 05:43:42,060
to get the answer but have been unable

5918
05:43:42,060 --> 05:43:44,520
to do so and in this photo you can see

5919
05:43:44,520 --> 05:43:46,920
at the bottom the the harness that they

5920
05:43:46,920 --> 05:43:49,260
use to release these drones

5921
05:43:49,260 --> 05:43:51,718
um in these drones uh you know kind of

5922
05:43:51,718 --> 05:43:53,218
complement the higher insurance that

5923
05:43:53,218 --> 05:43:55,500
they have which are used for

5924
05:43:55,500 --> 05:43:57,180
reconnaissance

5925
05:43:57,180 --> 05:43:59,940
and there's also complements the their

5926
05:43:59,940 --> 05:44:02,160
existing drugs that they have as well as

5927
05:44:02,160 --> 05:44:06,000
electrons provided to them from the U.S

5928
05:44:06,000 --> 05:44:06,780
um

5929
05:44:06,780 --> 05:44:09,718
and Russia has also responded to take

5930
05:44:09,718 --> 05:44:11,298
notes and is using the same trans

5931
05:44:11,298 --> 05:44:14,520
footage HTC Russian German trying to

5932
05:44:14,520 --> 05:44:16,740
knock out a Ukrainian drone and you know

5933
05:44:16,740 --> 05:44:18,680
obviously it's not very successful

5934
05:44:18,680 --> 05:44:21,780
Russia has also purchased a suicide

5935
05:44:21,780 --> 05:44:23,458
Trends from Iran

5936
05:44:23,458 --> 05:44:27,120
um so they can put a few a few kilograms

5937
05:44:27,120 --> 05:44:29,458
of explosives on these Trends and then

5938
05:44:29,458 --> 05:44:31,320
they fly them into the topics that they

5939
05:44:31,320 --> 05:44:35,280
want to you know Target and they've also

5940
05:44:35,280 --> 05:44:37,138
found U.S chips on the Australians which

5941
05:44:37,138 --> 05:44:38,700
could actually be assumptions violation

5942
05:44:38,700 --> 05:44:41,160
and in response EU sanctions have

5943
05:44:41,160 --> 05:44:43,740
actually additional EU sanctions have

5944
05:44:43,740 --> 05:44:47,760
been added as as a result of that the

5945
05:44:47,760 --> 05:44:49,740
Ukrainian military has had a lot of

5946
05:44:49,740 --> 05:44:54,958
success at taking down Uh Russian uh

5947
05:44:54,958 --> 05:44:57,780
Brokenness Australians using various

5948
05:44:57,780 --> 05:45:00,120
Jammers to measure the frequencies and

5949
05:45:00,120 --> 05:45:01,798
they're also using their own word

5950
05:45:01,798 --> 05:45:03,780
streaming initials so in this example

5951
05:45:03,780 --> 05:45:07,160
you see a Russian military munition

5952
05:45:07,160 --> 05:45:09,900
attacking a Ukrainian tank and then

5953
05:45:09,900 --> 05:45:12,298
obviously that you know takes that heart

5954
05:45:12,298 --> 05:45:14,940
and then kind of the last thing I wanted

5955
05:45:14,940 --> 05:45:17,340
to talk about is an effort which is a

5956
05:45:17,340 --> 05:45:20,160
kind of a play on matter so instead of

5957
05:45:20,160 --> 05:45:22,740
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

5958
05:45:22,740 --> 05:45:24,780
we have the North Atlantic fellows

5959
05:45:24,780 --> 05:45:26,638
organization and this is a group

5960
05:45:26,638 --> 05:45:30,180
specifically uh you know designed to

5961
05:45:30,180 --> 05:45:31,440
kind of counter some of the

5962
05:45:31,440 --> 05:45:33,240
disinformation that Russia is actually

5963
05:45:33,240 --> 05:45:35,458
pushing out so what they do is they use

5964
05:45:35,458 --> 05:45:39,480
enter for multiplication dogs to make

5965
05:45:39,480 --> 05:45:41,580
memes and then make fun of what's

5966
05:45:41,580 --> 05:45:43,798
actually going on so for example this

5967
05:45:43,798 --> 05:45:45,660
example you know they're fighting nature

5968
05:45:45,660 --> 05:45:47,100
it's like actually now you're losing to

5969
05:45:47,100 --> 05:45:49,740
our separate schools uh you know tearing

5970
05:45:49,740 --> 05:45:51,840
the stuffing out of ethnics for those of

5971
05:45:51,840 --> 05:45:53,458
you that don't know if ethnics of people

5972
05:45:53,458 --> 05:45:55,980
who believe Russian to propaganda and

5973
05:45:55,980 --> 05:45:58,400
this is just a few additional

5974
05:45:58,400 --> 05:46:02,218
examples and even the defense minister

5975
05:46:02,218 --> 05:46:04,200
of Ukraine has actually seen wearing a

5976
05:46:04,200 --> 05:46:06,180
t-shirt with the sheet of unity and I

5977
05:46:06,180 --> 05:46:07,440
just want to point out that stupid

5978
05:46:07,440 --> 05:46:09,298
emails actually wearing the T-shirt of

5979
05:46:09,298 --> 05:46:11,580
the same Champion so that so God was

5980
05:46:11,580 --> 05:46:14,280
nice to see the big Coast a lot of

5981
05:46:14,280 --> 05:46:16,500
artwork has also been created to come to

5982
05:46:16,500 --> 05:46:18,780
you know some of these uh false

5983
05:46:18,780 --> 05:46:20,340
narratives for those of you that are

5984
05:46:20,340 --> 05:46:21,780
good with history

5985
05:46:21,780 --> 05:46:24,000
um you might recognize some of the

5986
05:46:24,000 --> 05:46:27,958
sayings on these artworks

5987
05:46:27,958 --> 05:46:31,138
um and you know and memes I guess and

5988
05:46:31,138 --> 05:46:33,240
what also happened was is I started

5989
05:46:33,240 --> 05:46:35,400
putting shipping into stickers on

5990
05:46:35,400 --> 05:46:38,638
Russian Ukrainian

5991
05:46:38,638 --> 05:46:40,860
um you know weapon systems and you know

5992
05:46:40,860 --> 05:46:44,120
like the super bunker on the the turrets

5993
05:46:44,120 --> 05:46:47,000
as well as the network of baseball bats

5994
05:46:47,000 --> 05:46:48,920
before

5995
05:46:48,920 --> 05:46:53,400
and the U.S government also provided uh

5996
05:46:53,400 --> 05:46:56,580
Ukraine with 16 High Mobility artillery

5997
05:46:56,580 --> 05:46:59,160
rocket systems or hammers which have

5998
05:46:59,160 --> 05:47:01,138
been very successful at taking our

5999
05:47:01,138 --> 05:47:03,058
pressured targets for example ammunition

6000
05:47:03,058 --> 05:47:07,138
Depots and other critical uh targets and

6001
05:47:07,138 --> 05:47:09,540
I can assure you that these assets are

6002
05:47:09,540 --> 05:47:11,580
like probably the most well protected

6003
05:47:11,580 --> 05:47:14,160
assets in Ukraine because of how

6004
05:47:14,160 --> 05:47:16,440
successful they are Ukraine actually

6005
05:47:16,440 --> 05:47:20,280
created deeper of various decoys and to

6006
05:47:20,280 --> 05:47:22,200
actually draw out some of Russia's more

6007
05:47:22,200 --> 05:47:24,900
expensive Christmas Souls because of the

6008
05:47:24,900 --> 05:47:26,700
importance of targets and then obviously

6009
05:47:26,700 --> 05:47:29,160
they deplete so Russia's Christmas

6010
05:47:29,160 --> 05:47:32,040
albums in the process and as a result of

6011
05:47:32,040 --> 05:47:35,280
the effectivity of the hormones you know

6012
05:47:35,280 --> 05:47:38,160
a lot of means come about and many if

6013
05:47:38,160 --> 05:47:39,958
you look on social media what you'll see

6014
05:47:39,958 --> 05:47:42,540
is whenever you see a false Russian

6015
05:47:42,540 --> 05:47:44,940
narrative being pushed like somebody

6016
05:47:44,940 --> 05:47:46,558
from Napa will actually respond

6017
05:47:46,558 --> 05:47:48,420
typically with this name but there's a

6018
05:47:48,420 --> 05:47:51,558
lot of others when a whole bunch of

6019
05:47:51,558 --> 05:47:54,540
vehicles are actually donated to Ukraine

6020
05:47:54,540 --> 05:47:56,760
and the educate the nether sticker on

6021
05:47:56,760 --> 05:47:59,340
the vehicle when I first saw this video

6022
05:47:59,340 --> 05:48:01,200
I couldn't believe it but it's like I

6023
05:48:01,200 --> 05:48:06,600
just like you know I just funny

6024
05:48:06,600 --> 05:48:08,878
and obviously the Russian trolls really

6025
05:48:08,878 --> 05:48:12,298
don't like this they you know have been

6026
05:48:12,298 --> 05:48:15,540
compending with product and um what this

6027
05:48:15,540 --> 05:48:18,120
led to was a U.S intelligence account

6028
05:48:18,120 --> 05:48:20,700
actually tweeting uh you know that you

6029
05:48:20,700 --> 05:48:22,920
know of this activity and if you had

6030
05:48:22,920 --> 05:48:25,378
told me at the beginning of the war that

6031
05:48:25,378 --> 05:48:27,540
um you know a U.S intelligence account

6032
05:48:27,540 --> 05:48:30,360
would be tweeting that uh you know ship

6033
05:48:30,360 --> 05:48:32,458
it in adults are like making Russian

6034
05:48:32,458 --> 05:48:34,200
trolls men I probably would have laughed

6035
05:48:34,200 --> 05:48:36,420
in your face they have been allegations

6036
05:48:36,420 --> 05:48:38,700
by certain charlatans in the community

6037
05:48:38,700 --> 05:48:41,040
in our kingdom come there this is a CRP

6038
05:48:41,040 --> 05:48:44,058
information operation which is not true

6039
05:48:44,058 --> 05:48:47,580
Napa was actually created by a Ukrainian

6040
05:48:47,580 --> 05:48:50,100
with the goal of uh you know capturing

6041
05:48:50,100 --> 05:48:52,378
this this information campaign I'm sure

6042
05:48:52,378 --> 05:48:53,878
Western intelligence is probably

6043
05:48:53,878 --> 05:48:56,218
contributing to nepho and is probably

6044
05:48:56,218 --> 05:48:58,798
creating these names themselves but I

6045
05:48:58,798 --> 05:49:00,600
don't believe that it's a you know

6046
05:49:00,600 --> 05:49:02,400
Western intelligence operation from the

6047
05:49:02,400 --> 05:49:04,020
beginning

6048
05:49:04,020 --> 05:49:05,820
and the intercom to close off a little

6049
05:49:05,820 --> 05:49:06,718
bit

6050
05:49:06,718 --> 05:49:09,600
um I do think what is very clear is that

6051
05:49:09,600 --> 05:49:12,480
Russia has lost its information more to

6052
05:49:12,480 --> 05:49:14,458
a bunch of cartoon dogs

6053
05:49:14,458 --> 05:49:16,740
and then in closing you know where do we

6054
05:49:16,740 --> 05:49:19,378
go from yes Russia invaded Ukraine with

6055
05:49:19,378 --> 05:49:23,340
uh up to 180 000 troops they've lost at

6056
05:49:23,340 --> 05:49:25,320
least 85 000 troops including a lot of

6057
05:49:25,320 --> 05:49:28,100
Fighters and Equipment currently Russia

6058
05:49:28,100 --> 05:49:30,900
controls about 20 of Ukraine which is

6059
05:49:30,900 --> 05:49:35,100
about a 900 by 85 kilometer area and a

6060
05:49:35,100 --> 05:49:37,320
victory for Ukraine or Russia is

6061
05:49:37,320 --> 05:49:39,920
probably not going to be possible

6062
05:49:39,920 --> 05:49:42,780
and the Ukrainian regime which is

6063
05:49:42,780 --> 05:49:44,580
defined as they're kicking out pressure

6064
05:49:44,580 --> 05:49:47,878
from the country is very unlikely and

6065
05:49:47,878 --> 05:49:50,040
what this will probably require is a

6066
05:49:50,040 --> 05:49:51,840
political solution because I don't think

6067
05:49:51,840 --> 05:49:54,420
weapons are granted in the war

6068
05:49:54,420 --> 05:49:56,760
um maybe I'm wrong but this is you know

6069
05:49:56,760 --> 05:49:58,798
kind of what many analysts are kind of

6070
05:49:58,798 --> 05:50:01,500
saying and the engine first off I would

6071
05:50:01,500 --> 05:50:03,298
like to say a massive thank you to all

6072
05:50:03,298 --> 05:50:05,100
the researchers journalists analysts

6073
05:50:05,100 --> 05:50:07,740
activists and institutions that put up

6074
05:50:07,740 --> 05:50:09,718
their research and this presentation

6075
05:50:09,718 --> 05:50:11,580
would not be possible with the without

6076
05:50:11,580 --> 05:50:14,160
their research and you know like the

6077
05:50:14,160 --> 05:50:16,260
same that we like to build our work on

6078
05:50:16,260 --> 05:50:17,940
the shoulders of giants and that's when

6079
05:50:17,940 --> 05:50:20,218
we can really do good things and then

6080
05:50:20,218 --> 05:50:22,500
just a special thanks to Mikko Dimitri

6081
05:50:22,500 --> 05:50:25,620
Ryan and Stephen and Joseph for you know

6082
05:50:25,620 --> 05:50:27,058
helping support some of my views and

6083
05:50:27,058 --> 05:50:29,100
answering my questions and with that

6084
05:50:29,100 --> 05:50:30,958
that is the end of my presentation and

6085
05:50:30,958 --> 05:50:33,000
happy to take any questions

6086
05:50:33,000 --> 05:50:36,000
foreign

6087
05:51:00,320 --> 05:51:04,580
s that they have an unencrypted secure

6088
05:51:04,580 --> 05:51:07,320
telecoms network and what does that mean

6089
05:51:07,320 --> 05:51:10,080
because in my head secure is integrity

6090
05:51:10,080 --> 05:51:13,620
so so the the way that I understand it

6091
05:51:13,620 --> 05:51:15,900
is that the phones themselves the

6092
05:51:15,900 --> 05:51:17,940
signals are not encrypted but the

6093
05:51:17,940 --> 05:51:19,920
network that it runs on isn't encrypted

6094
05:51:19,920 --> 05:51:21,840
so it might be I don't know if all the

6095
05:51:21,840 --> 05:51:23,218
technical details but there's probably

6096
05:51:23,218 --> 05:51:25,860
being like they have two line encryptors

6097
05:51:25,860 --> 05:51:28,138
on the network is probably being

6098
05:51:28,138 --> 05:51:30,000
protected I mean you see this a lot with

6099
05:51:30,000 --> 05:51:32,120
ICS

6100
05:51:32,120 --> 05:51:34,500
they aren't encrypted but they are well

6101
05:51:34,500 --> 05:51:37,740
protected so sorry where I understand

6102
05:51:37,740 --> 05:51:40,260
that is that it's actually just a direct

6103
05:51:40,260 --> 05:51:43,860
line it's nice it doesn't have to be

6104
05:51:43,860 --> 05:51:45,840
incredible because it's a direct line

6105
05:51:45,840 --> 05:51:48,240
it's like you're not connected with your

6106
05:51:48,240 --> 05:51:51,420
laptop but my laptop is directly

6107
05:51:51,420 --> 05:51:53,420
connected connected

6108
05:51:53,420 --> 05:51:56,958
that's essentially the

6109
05:51:59,000 --> 05:52:01,798
yeah but because you know it's

6110
05:52:01,798 --> 05:52:04,020
potentially long distances I do think

6111
05:52:04,020 --> 05:52:06,780
there is like layer 2 uh you know

6112
05:52:06,780 --> 05:52:08,700
encrypt that I don't know the technical

6113
05:52:08,700 --> 05:52:12,020
details so yeah

6114
05:52:12,798 --> 05:52:14,840
uh

6115
05:52:14,840 --> 05:52:17,040
releases on the drones do you have any

6116
05:52:17,040 --> 05:52:18,958
information as to where that design came

6117
05:52:18,958 --> 05:52:22,280
from no idea

6118
05:52:23,910 --> 05:52:27,000
[Music]

6119
05:52:37,878 --> 05:52:41,218
this is saying that in any War the first

6120
05:52:41,218 --> 05:52:43,260
casualties the truth so the question

6121
05:52:43,260 --> 05:52:45,480
that I have to you is do you believe

6122
05:52:45,480 --> 05:52:48,180
that Ukraine is totally innocent in this

6123
05:52:48,180 --> 05:52:49,820
whole exercise

6124
05:52:49,820 --> 05:52:52,620
so the appropriate allegations of their

6125
05:52:52,620 --> 05:52:54,780
crumbs made up against the you know

6126
05:52:54,780 --> 05:52:56,580
Ukraine military

6127
05:52:56,580 --> 05:53:00,240
um and you know like it's possible and

6128
05:53:00,240 --> 05:53:02,280
very likely that they have you know

6129
05:53:02,280 --> 05:53:04,260
committed war crimes

6130
05:53:04,260 --> 05:53:06,900
um the evidence and you know of that is

6131
05:53:06,900 --> 05:53:09,600
you know not really clear I think it's

6132
05:53:09,600 --> 05:53:11,638
absolutely possible I wouldn't say you

6133
05:53:11,638 --> 05:53:14,600
know 100 years

6134
05:53:17,958 --> 05:53:21,680
oh thanks guys

6135
05:53:22,740 --> 05:53:25,789
[Music]

6136
05:53:27,080 --> 05:53:30,080
thank you

6137
06:05:18,080 --> 06:05:22,500
thank you challenge

6138
06:05:33,380 --> 06:05:36,470
[Music]

6139
06:05:56,040 --> 06:05:58,040
um

6140
06:05:58,920 --> 06:06:01,217
foreign

6141
06:06:35,878 --> 06:06:38,180
foreign

6142
06:07:07,860 --> 06:07:10,100
foreign

6143
06:07:38,700 --> 06:07:41,298
so final thought for the day

6144
06:07:41,298 --> 06:07:43,740
afterwards we're just going to do a

6145
06:07:43,740 --> 06:07:47,580
closing from our first and surprises

6146
06:07:47,580 --> 06:07:51,240
and you'll be off the body as well but

6147
06:07:51,240 --> 06:07:54,320
before all of that we've imported some

6148
06:07:54,320 --> 06:07:57,058
hacker goodness from the US

6149
06:07:57,058 --> 06:07:59,400
and I don't want to introduce him myself

6150
06:07:59,400 --> 06:08:01,080
because I want to screw it up so I'll

6151
06:08:01,080 --> 06:08:05,400
leave it to men insults and uh yeah I'll

6152
06:08:05,400 --> 06:08:08,458
give him a warm Cape Town or Commodities

6153
06:08:08,458 --> 06:08:10,280
here

6154
06:08:10,280 --> 06:08:13,440
[Applause]

6155
06:08:13,440 --> 06:08:15,557
thank you

6156
06:08:15,680 --> 06:08:18,360
he's gonna spend his birthday in South

6157
06:08:18,360 --> 06:08:20,638
Africa just to talk to a lot of you so

6158
06:08:20,638 --> 06:08:23,940
just take that it's not today but just

6159
06:08:23,940 --> 06:08:25,860
take that into you think it should be

6160
06:08:25,860 --> 06:08:27,920
fine hello everyone

6161
06:08:27,920 --> 06:08:30,298
thank you thank you for being hard

6162
06:08:30,298 --> 06:08:31,860
forward enough to actually stay to the

6163
06:08:31,860 --> 06:08:33,840
very end is like uh and actually make my

6164
06:08:33,840 --> 06:08:35,520
talk I always like it when that happens

6165
06:08:35,520 --> 06:08:38,820
and surprised so uh thanks uh we're

6166
06:08:38,820 --> 06:08:40,740
gonna start off with my legal disclaimer

6167
06:08:40,740 --> 06:08:43,200
uh I'm not a lawyer uh but I played one

6168
06:08:43,200 --> 06:08:45,660
on the internet successfully before uh

6169
06:08:45,660 --> 06:08:47,878
and so uh this is my legal disclaimer

6170
06:08:47,878 --> 06:08:49,860
because during my talk I'm going to talk

6171
06:08:49,860 --> 06:08:51,120
about things that are going to probably

6172
06:08:51,120 --> 06:08:53,638
you know go that's horrible why would

6173
06:08:53,638 --> 06:08:55,860
you do that it's like it's like and it's

6174
06:08:55,860 --> 06:08:58,138
like you're a bad man like no remember

6175
06:08:58,138 --> 06:09:01,320
the kittens I'm adorable okay it's like

6176
06:09:01,320 --> 06:09:03,540
I will not try to steal from you kill

6177
06:09:03,540 --> 06:09:05,040
you or ruin your financially unless you

6178
06:09:05,040 --> 06:09:07,020
paid me first there's always a contract

6179
06:09:07,020 --> 06:09:09,718
okay so when I go and you hear those

6180
06:09:09,718 --> 06:09:11,400
like you hear some of these stories and

6181
06:09:11,400 --> 06:09:13,740
you see some of the video yeah I got

6182
06:09:13,740 --> 06:09:15,840
video of it it's like you just remember

6183
06:09:15,840 --> 06:09:19,080
the kittens uh proud of my talk is

6184
06:09:19,080 --> 06:09:20,940
perceptions from a blue tractor to a

6185
06:09:20,940 --> 06:09:23,458
blue and black dress yes there is sort

6186
06:09:23,458 --> 06:09:26,100
of a message behind it but it's

6187
06:09:26,100 --> 06:09:29,100
basically one of perception uh it's like

6188
06:09:29,100 --> 06:09:33,058
because we all saw you know whenever I

6189
06:09:33,058 --> 06:09:34,558
used to see the little blue tractors

6190
06:09:34,558 --> 06:09:36,600
farm tractors I thought those are

6191
06:09:36,600 --> 06:09:39,540
adorable I'm adorable I love those

6192
06:09:39,540 --> 06:09:41,580
things those are no those are different

6193
06:09:41,580 --> 06:09:43,500
things are very scary they're anti-tank

6194
06:09:43,500 --> 06:09:46,920
weapons who knew you know it's like so

6195
06:09:46,920 --> 06:09:48,840
it's it's all about trying to go and

6196
06:09:48,840 --> 06:09:50,520
shows like oh this is what we think

6197
06:09:50,520 --> 06:09:52,920
something is but you never know when

6198
06:09:52,920 --> 06:09:54,840
someone could do something else with it

6199
06:09:54,840 --> 06:09:57,780
or when we see something and that we see

6200
06:09:57,780 --> 06:09:59,040
it every day and we're like oh that's

6201
06:09:59,040 --> 06:10:01,040
what this explore it's totally harmless

6202
06:10:01,040 --> 06:10:03,558
maybe not so much

6203
06:10:03,558 --> 06:10:05,638
also a big thing that I want to make

6204
06:10:05,638 --> 06:10:08,160
sure that I address is I got a lot of

6205
06:10:08,160 --> 06:10:11,100
swack for that uh I had some really good

6206

6213
06:10:26,400 --> 06:10:28,080
that are committed to doing good one of

6214
06:10:28,080 --> 06:10:29,878
my friends is missing because he was

6215
06:10:29,878 --> 06:10:32,520
protesting in Moscow against the uh

6216
06:10:32,520 --> 06:10:34,740
illegal Butte Invasion and it's like and

6217
06:10:34,740 --> 06:10:36,718
but some other hackers were coming to me

6218
06:10:36,718 --> 06:10:39,480
and I'm like well why are you you know

6219
06:10:39,480 --> 06:10:42,000
why are you anti-russian and I'm like no

6220
06:10:42,000 --> 06:10:45,240
I'm not anti-russian Russia is a

6221
06:10:45,240 --> 06:10:47,360
wonderful country I'm an

6222
06:10:47,360 --> 06:10:49,558
anti-putin's illegal Invasion which is

6223
06:10:49,558 --> 06:10:52,020
destroying his country and the Ukrainian

6224
06:10:52,020 --> 06:10:54,480
country that's what I'm against there's

6225
06:10:54,480 --> 06:10:56,940
a difference and I'm not trying to be

6226
06:10:56,940 --> 06:10:59,100
political I'm trying to say there are

6227
06:10:59,100 --> 06:11:00,718
some things that we have to stand up for

6228
06:11:00,718 --> 06:11:04,320
it's like when George W bush legally

6229
06:11:04,320 --> 06:11:06,840
invaded Iraq and it's like for you know

6230
06:11:06,840 --> 06:11:08,638
the whole lie about the weapons of mass

6231
06:11:08,638 --> 06:11:10,378
destruction because you know that was a

6232
06:11:10,378 --> 06:11:12,298
lie and wrongful Invasion so I should

6233
06:11:12,298 --> 06:11:13,680
know it's like you know that future

6234
06:11:13,680 --> 06:11:16,260
stuff is wrong it's like there was a

6235
06:11:16,260 --> 06:11:18,058
symbol though from that it's like

6236
06:11:18,058 --> 06:11:20,218
someone threw a shoot and if you were

6237
06:11:20,218 --> 06:11:22,260
from if you know about Arabic culture

6238
06:11:22,260 --> 06:11:25,500
it's like in the Middle East a shoe just

6239
06:11:25,500 --> 06:11:27,958
seeing the soul of one's foot is an

6240
06:11:27,958 --> 06:11:31,260
insult to throw the shoe that's more

6241
06:11:31,260 --> 06:11:33,900
than milkshakes or tomatoes okay that's

6242
06:11:33,900 --> 06:11:36,780
bad it's like so it was it's a big

6243
06:11:36,780 --> 06:11:39,000
insult it's that one shoe became the

6244
06:11:39,000 --> 06:11:41,820
symbol of the unrest that the Iraqis had

6245
06:11:41,820 --> 06:11:44,280
from you know people invading you know

6246
06:11:44,280 --> 06:11:46,200
their country because it's like

6247
06:11:46,200 --> 06:11:50,340
attacking Iraq after 9 11 is like would

6248
06:11:50,340 --> 06:11:52,440
be like you know the U.S attack it

6249
06:11:52,440 --> 06:11:54,240
doesn't be attacked Afghanistan and like

6250
06:11:54,240 --> 06:11:56,638
oh let's take a block too that's like if

6251
06:11:56,638 --> 06:11:58,980
during World War II as if we decided to

6252
06:11:58,980 --> 06:12:01,260
go oh and during Pearl Harbor it's like

6253
06:12:01,260 --> 06:12:04,620
well let's attack Japan and Mexico

6254
06:12:04,620 --> 06:12:07,200
you know it's like not really it

6255
06:12:07,200 --> 06:12:10,080
shouldn't be done so that shoe was the

6256
06:12:10,080 --> 06:12:12,600
symbol in the 1970s when women were

6257
06:12:12,600 --> 06:12:14,100
having to fight for their rights you

6258
06:12:14,100 --> 06:12:15,900
know to be counted as like you know a

6259
06:12:15,900 --> 06:12:18,660
human being it's like they threw things

6260
06:12:18,660 --> 06:12:21,120
in the dumpster to show that legal

6261
06:12:21,120 --> 06:12:22,558
rights they never burned it they never

6262
06:12:22,558 --> 06:12:24,240
burned brawls they were throwing them in

6263
06:12:24,240 --> 06:12:25,740
the dumpster along with broom handles

6264
06:12:25,740 --> 06:12:27,600
and other things that were supposed to

6265
06:12:27,600 --> 06:12:30,000
be considered feminine but of course you

6266
06:12:30,000 --> 06:12:32,100
know guys mean guys to reporters are all

6267
06:12:32,100 --> 06:12:34,440
concentrated on the bra uh because the

6268
06:12:34,440 --> 06:12:37,138
boobies it's like and it's like and and

6269
06:12:37,138 --> 06:12:39,420
that became the symbol of that movement

6270
06:12:39,420 --> 06:12:42,240
it's like and luckily you know since the

6271
06:12:42,240 --> 06:12:44,280
1970s that's all been fixed in America

6272
06:12:44,280 --> 06:12:46,260
and women are just talking away no sorry

6273
06:12:46,260 --> 06:12:48,958
it's like uh it's still a dumpster fire

6274
06:12:48,958 --> 06:12:51,958
there uh for women uh it's like but yes

6275
06:12:51,958 --> 06:12:55,138
uh but that became the symbol and then I

6276
06:12:55,138 --> 06:12:58,378
ran right now currently they're just

6277
06:12:58,378 --> 06:13:00,180
doing the simple thing of cutting your

6278
06:13:00,180 --> 06:13:03,298
hair and it's like in frustration and

6279
06:13:03,298 --> 06:13:05,040
rebellion and people realize like why

6280
06:13:05,040 --> 06:13:07,138
are they cutting your hair it's from all

6281
06:13:07,138 --> 06:13:10,138
the way from a home from the shore I I'm

6282
06:13:10,138 --> 06:13:11,400
not gonna mispronounce this but there's

6283
06:13:11,400 --> 06:13:13,138
an opal it's like it's a tradition from

6284
06:13:13,138 --> 06:13:15,180
hundreds and hundreds of years where

6285
06:13:15,180 --> 06:13:16,680
when they go to battle or when they go

6286
06:13:16,680 --> 06:13:18,298
to protest and when they go to show that

6287
06:13:18,298 --> 06:13:20,400
they're recruiting for war they will cut

6288
06:13:20,400 --> 06:13:22,620
their hair and so they're cutting their

6289
06:13:22,620 --> 06:13:25,260
hair as their protest against the regime

6290
06:13:25,260 --> 06:13:27,180
the unlawful regime that's going on

6291
06:13:27,180 --> 06:13:29,580
right now in Iran that is like putting

6292
06:13:29,580 --> 06:13:32,100
them in just as much Jeopardy as Iran

6293
06:13:32,100 --> 06:13:34,200
puts the rest of the world uh in

6294
06:13:34,200 --> 06:13:36,718
Jeopardy so it's those kind of

6295
06:13:36,718 --> 06:13:38,760
outpouring and those protest it doesn't

6296
06:13:38,760 --> 06:13:41,340
matter what country I'm from it's like

6297
06:13:41,340 --> 06:13:42,958
I've got to stand up and say something

6298
06:13:42,958 --> 06:13:45,180
because if you have a voice use it

6299
06:13:45,180 --> 06:13:47,400
because a lot of other people don't have

6300
06:13:47,400 --> 06:13:50,940
one and so that's what I try to do uh so

6301
06:13:50,940 --> 06:13:52,920
that's what's not I don't hate Russia

6302
06:13:52,920 --> 06:13:55,820
it's like I hate dictators

6303
06:13:55,820 --> 06:13:58,558
uh nothing about me I like to ride

6304
06:13:58,558 --> 06:14:00,840
motorcycles uh I've been on uh

6305
06:14:00,840 --> 06:14:03,840
television correcting reporters uh it

6306
06:14:03,840 --> 06:14:05,040
looks like I like screaming at people

6307
06:14:05,040 --> 06:14:07,138
but that's actually beginning to talk uh

6308
06:14:07,138 --> 06:14:08,820
I like to do weird things in weird

6309
06:14:08,820 --> 06:14:11,280
places that's me actually skydiving uh

6310
06:14:11,280 --> 06:14:13,740
outside of Mossel Bay uh here in South

6311
06:14:13,740 --> 06:14:16,680
Africa and there's me robbing a bank uh

6312
06:14:16,680 --> 06:14:18,600
and then I love playing no man's Sky no

6313
06:14:18,600 --> 06:14:20,940

6323
06:14:43,020 --> 06:14:44,218
bit different because I decided to end

6324
06:14:44,218 --> 06:14:46,680
it I missed it's like I wanted to bust a

6325
06:14:46,680 --> 06:14:48,480
Miss uh so this is the last talk I'm

6326
06:14:48,480 --> 06:14:50,878
giving this year I think it's like it's

6327
06:14:50,878 --> 06:14:52,500
been a long year it's like so it's like

6328
06:14:52,500 --> 06:14:54,058
there's a lot of good content it's like

6329
06:14:54,058 --> 06:14:55,378
I want to go over it it's like I want to

6330
06:14:55,378 --> 06:14:57,260
start off with the blue team myth okay

6331
06:14:57,260 --> 06:15:00,600
uh humans are the weakest link

6332
06:15:00,600 --> 06:15:04,020
that is so much bull crap so much of a

6333
06:15:04,020 --> 06:15:06,320
lazy excuse that blue team your shoes

6334
06:15:06,320 --> 06:15:09,120
when a user clicks on a link on the

6335
06:15:09,120 --> 06:15:12,240
website or a user clicks on a email they

6336
06:15:12,240 --> 06:15:14,040
they're like well we're playing these

6337
06:15:14,040 --> 06:15:15,798
away

6338
06:15:15,798 --> 06:15:18,180
stupid information security didn't

6339
06:15:18,180 --> 06:15:21,120
probably teach their users it's like

6340
06:15:21,120 --> 06:15:23,520
they're not the weakest link they're the

6341
06:15:23,520 --> 06:15:26,100
least invested in

6342
06:15:26,100 --> 06:15:29,878
if I and was running the company and I

6343
06:15:29,878 --> 06:15:32,638
invested in my technology

6344
06:15:32,638 --> 06:15:36,480
as much as I uh to protect my people as

6345
06:15:36,480 --> 06:15:38,878
much as I invest in people to protect my

6346
06:15:38,878 --> 06:15:40,680
technology

6347
06:15:40,680 --> 06:15:42,958
our company would have a firewall like a

6348
06:15:42,958 --> 06:15:45,180
PIX you know 800 or something like that

6349
06:15:45,180 --> 06:15:47,760
with the default ACL list with a allow

6350
06:15:47,760 --> 06:15:50,878
all right it's like no logging because

6351
06:15:50,878 --> 06:15:52,020
you know that's just gonna cut her up

6352
06:15:52,020 --> 06:15:52,920
and we don't have a place to actually

6353
06:15:52,920 --> 06:15:54,600
put the backup for that so screw that we

6354
06:15:54,600 --> 06:15:56,340
don't need that it's like if they would

6355
06:15:56,340 --> 06:15:58,980
have a snort bass installed with all the

6356
06:15:58,980 --> 06:16:00,718
signatures running but that's okay no

6357
06:16:00,718 --> 06:16:01,860
one's actually paying attention to it

6358
06:16:01,860 --> 06:16:03,120
because we've ever seen our freaking

6359
06:16:03,120 --> 06:16:05,340
smart installed with the basic script

6360
06:16:05,340 --> 06:16:07,558
running right it's like

6361
06:16:07,558 --> 06:16:10,200
would that be helpful for your company

6362
06:16:10,200 --> 06:16:14,638
no so you invest money you work on that

6363
06:16:14,638 --> 06:16:16,138
you make sure that you're applying the

6364
06:16:16,138 --> 06:16:17,760
right technology to protect your company

6365
06:16:17,760 --> 06:16:20,400
from Network and computer-based attacks

6366
06:16:20,400 --> 06:16:21,780
but you need to understand that it's

6367
06:16:21,780 --> 06:16:24,900
evolving we need to start investing

6368
06:16:24,900 --> 06:16:28,440
and our people to learn how to protect

6369
06:16:28,440 --> 06:16:31,500
our technology and then using the

6370
06:16:31,500 --> 06:16:34,740
technology as a safety net

6371
06:16:34,740 --> 06:16:37,200
we've been using technology like it's a

6372
06:16:37,200 --> 06:16:38,340
wall it's like you know we're gonna like

6373
06:16:38,340 --> 06:16:40,138
build a wall make the apts pay for it

6374
06:16:40,138 --> 06:16:41,940
trust me I know that doesn't work okay

6375
06:16:41,940 --> 06:16:43,980
it's like spoiled World alert it's like

6376
06:16:43,980 --> 06:16:46,680
we gotta stop trying to make it as the

6377
06:16:46,680 --> 06:16:48,360
one all defense because when that

6378
06:16:48,360 --> 06:16:51,840
technology fails and it will it's like

6379
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:53,340
you're screwed

6380
06:16:53,340 --> 06:16:55,500
because a human's not prepared to to

6381
06:16:55,500 --> 06:16:57,660
take over and figure out what's going on

6382
06:16:57,660 --> 06:17:00,420
it's like so you need to start showing

6383
06:17:00,420 --> 06:17:02,638
more and creating more of a way to get

6384
06:17:02,638 --> 06:17:04,740
people to protect the technology and

6385
06:17:04,740 --> 06:17:07,378
when they screw up and they will it's

6386
06:17:07,378 --> 06:17:09,600
like the technology can be the safety

6387
06:17:09,600 --> 06:17:11,280
net to keep you from being you know

6388
06:17:11,280 --> 06:17:14,218
totally breached and trust me it's like

6389
06:17:14,218 --> 06:17:15,298
I never was like you know a lot of

6390
06:17:15,298 --> 06:17:16,740
racism is going like yeah those blue

6391
06:17:16,740 --> 06:17:18,780
teamers let's talk about how stupid the

6392
06:17:18,780 --> 06:17:21,480
bread teamers are sometimes okay uh

6393
06:17:21,480 --> 06:17:23,340
because the red team myth that I hate

6394
06:17:23,340 --> 06:17:24,840
the most is that they're there to break

6395
06:17:24,840 --> 06:17:27,540
into systems exploit what they can and

6396
06:17:27,540 --> 06:17:28,980
show the client how they failed and

6397
06:17:28,980 --> 06:17:30,840
defending against their Elite attacks

6398
06:17:30,840 --> 06:17:34,740
and hacks it's like mother I am so tired

6399
06:17:34,740 --> 06:17:36,780
of the toxic masculinity and the

6400
06:17:36,780 --> 06:17:38,638
freaking red teaming industry where it's

6401
06:17:38,638 --> 06:17:40,620
like they're not their whole their whole

6402
06:17:40,620 --> 06:17:45,298
motto of of uh quickie things is from a

6403
06:17:45,298 --> 06:17:48,840
convicted rapist it's like who when he

6404
06:17:48,840 --> 06:17:51,840
was hit with the in the face it's like

6405
06:17:51,840 --> 06:17:54,180
decided to buy the guy's ear off as its

6406
06:17:54,180 --> 06:17:57,000
only recourse okay if that's your life

6407
06:17:57,000 --> 06:18:00,660
coach you need a new life okay and also

6408
06:18:00,660 --> 06:18:01,740
he's a plagiarist he actually

6409
06:18:01,740 --> 06:18:03,900
plagiarized that saying from uh

6410
06:18:03,900 --> 06:18:06,360
oppression General who actually you

6411
06:18:06,360 --> 06:18:09,058
as a warning for people like the red

6412
06:18:09,058 --> 06:18:09,840
team

6413
06:18:09,840 --> 06:18:11,760
because it was actually no battle plan

6414
06:18:11,760 --> 06:18:14,100
ever somebody's contact with the Enemy

6415
06:18:14,100 --> 06:18:16,620
that should be a warning for red teamers

6416
06:18:16,620 --> 06:18:18,058
that when you go into that place

6417
06:18:18,058 --> 06:18:20,100
whatever you thought were you were

6418
06:18:20,100 --> 06:18:22,138
claiming you're not prepared for what

6419
06:18:22,138 --> 06:18:23,700
you're going to find

6420
06:18:23,700 --> 06:18:25,920
it's like that's what it was about but I

6421
06:18:25,920 --> 06:18:27,180
mean you know

6422
06:18:27,180 --> 06:18:29,218
Mike crisis like you know I don't think

6423
06:18:29,218 --> 06:18:30,420
how did you expect somebody to get it

6424
06:18:30,420 --> 06:18:32,940
right it's like so we need to stop with

6425
06:18:32,940 --> 06:18:34,260
this attitude

6426
06:18:34,260 --> 06:18:37,558
that red teamers are there to break

6427
06:18:37,558 --> 06:18:40,020
things that red team members are there

6428
06:18:40,020 --> 06:18:42,780
because they're because they're like the

6429
06:18:42,780 --> 06:18:44,940
elite rock stars in this industry screw

6430
06:18:44,940 --> 06:18:47,458
that noise the only reason why the red

6431
06:18:47,458 --> 06:18:49,620
team exists is to make the blue team

6432
06:18:49,620 --> 06:18:50,878
better

6433
06:18:50,878 --> 06:18:53,458
and if you're not part of the red team

6434
06:18:53,458 --> 06:18:55,620
and trying to be an advocate for your

6435
06:18:55,620 --> 06:18:56,638
clients

6436
06:18:56,638 --> 06:18:58,378
and you're more concerned about being

6437
06:18:58,378 --> 06:19:02,340
the adversary you suck at your job

6438
06:19:02,340 --> 06:19:04,860
it's like so that's what that's about

6439
06:19:04,860 --> 06:19:07,740
it's like so making a lot of things here

6440
06:19:07,740 --> 06:19:10,920
yeah it's like but straight up that's

6441
06:19:10,920 --> 06:19:13,378
what we need to understand it's like I'm

6442
06:19:13,378 --> 06:19:16,620
not trying to be an adversary to my

6443
06:19:16,620 --> 06:19:18,660
clients I'm trying to be an advocate it

6444
06:19:18,660 --> 06:19:22,260
doesn't matter how well and weak my

6445
06:19:22,260 --> 06:19:24,798
attacks are they're not paying for that

6446
06:19:24,798 --> 06:19:28,558
no client in history has paid you for

6447
06:19:28,558 --> 06:19:29,700
that

6448
06:19:29,700 --> 06:19:32,958
they're getting Aqua free every day

6449
06:19:32,958 --> 06:19:35,100
they're because of you for the report

6450
06:19:35,100 --> 06:19:38,580
mother that's what your job is

6451
06:19:38,580 --> 06:19:40,920
it doesn't matter how good your Elite

6452
06:19:40,920 --> 06:19:42,058
hats are

6453
06:19:42,058 --> 06:19:44,218
or how well you bust it if you can't

6454
06:19:44,218 --> 06:19:46,860
properly train that and talk to that and

6455
06:19:46,860 --> 06:19:49,740
communicate that to the team and to your

6456
06:19:49,740 --> 06:19:51,660
clients and to their Executives and show

6457
06:19:51,660 --> 06:19:53,160
them the importance of getting these

6458
06:19:53,160 --> 06:19:55,440
things fixed and how they can get those

6459
06:19:55,440 --> 06:19:59,218
things fixed you wasted everybody's time

6460
06:19:59,218 --> 06:20:01,500
it's like it doesn't matter how cool it

6461
06:20:01,500 --> 06:20:04,200
was it's ineffectual it's unfortunate

6462
06:20:04,200 --> 06:20:06,900
because there was no actionable items

6463
06:20:06,900 --> 06:20:07,920
afterwards

6464
06:20:07,920 --> 06:20:09,240
that is what we need to start

6465
06:20:09,240 --> 06:20:12,120
understanding you were there to make the

6466
06:20:12,120 --> 06:20:14,160
blue team better you were there to help

6467
06:20:14,160 --> 06:20:17,100
verify and make sure that the defenses

6468
06:20:17,100 --> 06:20:18,780
are working the way they wanted them and

6469
06:20:18,780 --> 06:20:21,360
if you're not doing that retired

6470
06:20:21,360 --> 06:20:25,860
it's like uh so I'm not sorry I'm a

6471
06:20:25,860 --> 06:20:27,540
little icy it's like it's like so yeah

6472
06:20:27,540 --> 06:20:28,860
but I'm just going to deal with it this

6473
06:20:28,860 --> 06:20:30,958
is mine I'm going out in the blaze of

6474
06:20:30,958 --> 06:20:32,638
glory this year guys it's like just

6475
06:20:32,638 --> 06:20:35,580
enjoy the ride okay it's like because I

6476
06:20:35,580 --> 06:20:38,520
ain't done it's like and I'm not limited

6477
06:20:38,520 --> 06:20:40,080
to the red and blue team okay because

6478
06:20:40,080 --> 06:20:42,420
it's like you know I like colors it's

6479
06:20:42,420 --> 06:20:44,638
like uh I like to call myself a

6480
06:20:44,638 --> 06:20:47,940
simulated adversary or uh Sean from a

6481
06:20:47,940 --> 06:20:49,798
podcast it's like in the UK he said I'm

6482
06:20:49,798 --> 06:20:51,540
the security awareness operative and I

6483
06:20:51,540 --> 06:20:52,980
think oh that sounds cool because I can

6484
06:20:52,980 --> 06:20:55,620
secret agent the security word is

6485
06:20:55,620 --> 06:20:58,020
awkward it's like which it sounds a lot

6486
06:20:58,020 --> 06:20:59,520
better than you know it's like hey I'm a

6487
06:20:59,520 --> 06:21:01,200
guy who likes a lot of people so it's

6488
06:21:01,200 --> 06:21:03,900
like which is that that sounds cool too

6489
06:21:03,900 --> 06:21:06,958
um but for me it's about education not

6490
06:21:06,958 --> 06:21:10,080
exploitation I don't use any exploits in

6491
06:21:10,080 --> 06:21:12,000
any of my attacks in any of my

6492
06:21:12,000 --> 06:21:13,620
engagements it's like they're always

6493
06:21:13,620 --> 06:21:15,780
like popping notepad or just you know

6494
06:21:15,780 --> 06:21:17,520
doing something that helps educate

6495
06:21:17,520 --> 06:21:22,080
because I want them to catch me

6496
06:21:22,080 --> 06:21:25,080
in every engagement I promised my client

6497
06:21:25,080 --> 06:21:27,600
it is part of our contract it is part of

6498
06:21:27,600 --> 06:21:30,298
their understanding that by the third

6499
06:21:30,298 --> 06:21:33,420
day of the engagement I will be caught

6500
06:21:33,420 --> 06:21:35,940
it's like either by them actually doing

6501
06:21:35,940 --> 06:21:38,400
a great job which is the best

6502
06:21:38,400 --> 06:21:40,138
It's like because if you're not rooting

6503
06:21:40,138 --> 06:21:42,180
for your clients you need to you know

6504
06:21:42,180 --> 06:21:44,520
reach reorganize your life priorities

6505
06:21:44,520 --> 06:21:46,920
you want them to do good you're there

6506
06:21:46,920 --> 06:21:49,860
not to break it but to validate it so if

6507
06:21:49,860 --> 06:21:51,718
you validate it that showed that they

6508
06:21:51,718 --> 06:21:53,340
they were good and that they caught

6509
06:21:53,340 --> 06:21:56,340
something that's still a win

6510
06:21:56,340 --> 06:21:58,620
so I want to make sure that I get called

6511
06:21:58,620 --> 06:22:00,660
because I want it to be a positive

6512
06:22:00,660 --> 06:22:02,760
experience for the users

6513
06:22:02,760 --> 06:22:04,860
because I'm not breaking into servers

6514
06:22:04,860 --> 06:22:06,958
I'm attacking people

6515
06:22:06,958 --> 06:22:10,798
I have never seen an email server get

6516
06:22:10,798 --> 06:22:13,620
sad because they got popped within SOA

6517
06:22:13,620 --> 06:22:17,340
67 does it still happen yes today yes it

6518
06:22:17,340 --> 06:22:19,200
still happens it's like you know now

6519
06:22:19,200 --> 06:22:20,218
they're going through like this really

6520
06:22:20,218 --> 06:22:22,860
hot new sexy thing from 2011 you know

6521
06:22:22,860 --> 06:22:24,360
Eternal blue or something but still it's

6522
06:22:24,360 --> 06:22:25,620
still happening

6523
06:22:25,620 --> 06:22:27,120
okay

6524
06:22:27,120 --> 06:22:30,240
but the servers don't get upset for that

6525
06:22:30,240 --> 06:22:32,218
but people do

6526
06:22:32,218 --> 06:22:34,320
instead of just giving them all the

6527
06:22:34,320 --> 06:22:36,420
things to look down on and what they did

6528
06:22:36,420 --> 06:22:37,260
wrong

6529
06:22:37,260 --> 06:22:39,298
I always make sure I give them something

6530
06:22:39,298 --> 06:22:42,360
to look up to something to show that

6531
06:22:42,360 --> 06:22:44,700
they can try to emulate so they can go

6532
06:22:44,700 --> 06:22:46,620
up to that point and be like that person

6533
06:22:46,620 --> 06:22:49,920
and yes sometimes I have to try really

6534
06:22:49,920 --> 06:22:52,798
hard to get caught it's like it's fat

6535
06:22:52,798 --> 06:22:55,138
it's like I mean I've spun around in a

6536
06:22:55,138 --> 06:22:57,900
chair before it's like I I shut down the

6537
06:22:57,900 --> 06:23:00,000
machine it's like during business hours

6538
06:23:00,000 --> 06:23:01,680
and walked it out of the teller before

6539
06:23:01,680 --> 06:23:02,940
they figured out that I wasn't supposed

6540
06:23:02,940 --> 06:23:05,160
to be there for the last half hour it's

6541
06:23:05,160 --> 06:23:08,520
like what they did and they were the win

6542
06:23:08,520 --> 06:23:11,160
and I wrote their names down never write

6543
06:23:11,160 --> 06:23:13,378
down someone who failed it's like I

6544
06:23:13,378 --> 06:23:15,058
always write down the people who catch

6545
06:23:15,058 --> 06:23:17,540
me because it's not and I tell them

6546
06:23:17,540 --> 06:23:20,100
after about two minutes after I've

6547
06:23:20,100 --> 06:23:22,138
successfully escaped I go back and I

6548
06:23:22,138 --> 06:23:24,180
talk to every single person that I live

6549
06:23:24,180 --> 06:23:26,100
that's my job that's where the work

6550
06:23:26,100 --> 06:23:28,200
starts because that's what the social

6551
06:23:28,200 --> 06:23:30,660
engineering starts like yeah I'm sorry I

6552
06:23:30,660 --> 06:23:32,458
was a horrible guy and I just robbed you

6553
06:23:32,458 --> 06:23:33,958
what you did and you shouldn't have done

6554
06:23:33,958 --> 06:23:36,660
I was being a bad person and oh yeah

6555
06:23:36,660 --> 06:23:37,740
you're not giving those

6556
06:23:37,740 --> 06:23:40,138
I lied I'm a horrible person you

6557
06:23:40,138 --> 06:23:41,700
remember the kittens it's like but it's

6558
06:23:41,700 --> 06:23:44,638
like yeah it's I'm sorry but this is why

6559
06:23:44,638 --> 06:23:46,200
this is helping you

6560
06:23:46,200 --> 06:23:48,958
because I'm not here to test you I'm

6561
06:23:48,958 --> 06:23:51,360
here to teach you so therefore you

6562
06:23:51,360 --> 06:23:54,120
didn't lose you learned

6563
06:23:54,120 --> 06:23:56,520
it's like you've had a lesson and that's

6564
06:23:56,520 --> 06:23:58,980
what it was about and you show them how

6565
06:23:58,980 --> 06:24:00,360
you're just trying to teach them and you

6566
06:24:00,360 --> 06:24:02,040
weren't trying to and you make it a

6567
06:24:02,040 --> 06:24:04,740
positive experience and that way you

6568
06:24:04,740 --> 06:24:08,580
have a very well educated Workforce that

6569
06:24:08,580 --> 06:24:10,620
is now understands what an attack looks

6570
06:24:10,620 --> 06:24:12,660
like when it occurs and you'll be more

6571
06:24:12,660 --> 06:24:15,058
ready for it it's like that's how that

6572
06:24:15,058 --> 06:24:17,340
happens because and I don't use Advanced

6573
06:24:17,340 --> 06:24:20,100
attacks it's like I'm not using like you

6574
06:24:20,100 --> 06:24:21,298
know old days you're like that because

6575
06:24:21,298 --> 06:24:22,980
that's like you know wave of you know my

6576
06:24:22,980 --> 06:24:25,980
skill level it's like always here I'm so

6577
06:24:25,980 --> 06:24:29,040
tired of hearing about apts oh my gosh

6579
06:24:30,820 --> 06:24:32,000
[Music]

6580
06:24:32,000 --> 06:24:35,160
that's it's like you know what ABT is

6581
06:24:35,160 --> 06:24:36,958
what the CEOs of the shareholders in the

6582
06:24:36,958 --> 06:24:38,340
public when they get popped by an email

6583
06:24:38,340 --> 06:24:41,760
right it's like that's what apts are apt

6584
06:24:41,760 --> 06:24:44,820
stands for not advanced

6585
06:24:44,820 --> 06:24:46,680
persistent

6586
06:24:46,680 --> 06:24:49,558
threat you know it's chill it's scary

6587
06:24:49,558 --> 06:24:52,020
it's like you know it's like no

6588
06:24:52,020 --> 06:24:53,520

6589
06:24:53,520 --> 06:24:58,798
fishing technique there that's apt now

6590
06:24:58,798 --> 06:25:01,920
we got it now we know what to do it's

6591
06:25:01,920 --> 06:25:05,340
like that's what an apt is okay I'm not

6592
06:25:05,340 --> 06:25:08,298
even doing that stuff I'm just bad

6593
06:25:08,298 --> 06:25:13,399
basic adorable destruction

6594
06:25:13,760 --> 06:25:15,718
I'm not checking to see if you're

6595
06:25:15,718 --> 06:25:19,280
compliant it's like you know I call PCI

6596
06:25:19,280 --> 06:25:21,240
shrublinger's uh compliance because

6597
06:25:21,240 --> 06:25:23,400
everybody's PCI Compliant until they're

6598
06:25:23,400 --> 06:25:25,620
not have you noticed that you notice

6599
06:25:25,620 --> 06:25:26,520
that all these companies that get

6600
06:25:26,520 --> 06:25:27,360
popular

6601
06:25:27,360 --> 06:25:28,500
like he's gotta get one piece out of

6602
06:25:28,500 --> 06:25:29,540
your mind

6603
06:25:29,540 --> 06:25:32,040
it's like you know it's like so yeah so

6604
06:25:32,040 --> 06:25:33,540
that's really weird but it's like no I

6605
06:25:33,540 --> 06:25:36,660
don't care about your your your uh PCI

6606

06:25:43,920 --> 06:25:45,360
you want to name a policy actor I don't

6610
06:25:45,360 --> 06:25:46,440
care

6611
06:25:46,440 --> 06:25:48,378
I'm

6612
06:25:48,378 --> 06:25:51,480
there to be the worst possible thing to

6613
06:25:51,480 --> 06:25:53,340
happen to you at the worst possible time

6614
06:25:53,340 --> 06:25:55,620
in the worst possible way

6615
06:25:55,620 --> 06:25:57,298
I'm great at parties you know it's like

6616
06:25:57,298 --> 06:25:58,860
that's what I'm there for

6617
06:25:58,860 --> 06:26:00,900
it's like I just want to be I mean I

6618
06:26:00,900 --> 06:26:03,058
live by fireflies Serenity you know big

6619
06:26:03,058 --> 06:26:05,280
box 95 for canceling but you know I

6620
06:26:05,280 --> 06:26:06,900
guess they need to be a bad guy it's

6621
06:26:06,900 --> 06:26:08,160
like you know it's like I just want to

6622
06:26:08,160 --> 06:26:11,400
misbehave and that's what I do it's like

6623
06:26:11,400 --> 06:26:14,040
I if I go in there and I see so many

6624
06:26:14,040 --> 06:26:16,020
people go into their clients and they

6625
06:26:16,020 --> 06:26:19,138
tell them it's like oh I uh we went

6626
06:26:19,138 --> 06:26:20,940
through the zero days like kind of just

6627
06:26:20,940 --> 06:26:22,558
like I only get this remote shell and

6628
06:26:22,558 --> 06:26:24,000
did the privilege escalation which we're

6629
06:26:24,000 --> 06:26:25,320
able to then pivot into this other

6630
06:26:25,320 --> 06:26:27,240
network and say no and then we got all

6631
06:26:27,240 --> 06:26:28,920
the secrets like and then and then one

6632
06:26:28,920 --> 06:26:30,840
of our uh brick teamers are said you

6633
06:26:30,840 --> 06:26:32,160
know they went through the skyline and

6634
06:26:32,160 --> 06:26:32,878
stuff you know they're able to

6635
06:26:32,878 --> 06:26:35,400
circumvent the security by overriding

6636
06:26:35,400 --> 06:26:37,500
the the Match Machine inside you know to

6637
06:26:37,500 --> 06:26:39,718
open and you know what the clients are

6638
06:26:39,718 --> 06:26:40,760
saying

6639
06:26:40,760 --> 06:26:43,020
we're secure

6640
06:26:43,020 --> 06:26:45,120
and you're like what the I just told you

6641
06:26:45,120 --> 06:26:48,120
yeah but you were like ninjas and you're

6642
06:26:48,120 --> 06:26:49,798
like the EPG he's like we don't have to

6643
06:26:49,798 --> 06:26:51,420
worry about that we're not an actor we

6644
06:26:51,420 --> 06:26:52,558
don't have to worry about nation states

6645
06:26:52,558 --> 06:26:54,360
we're just like a donut factory in Des

6646
06:26:54,360 --> 06:26:55,980
Moines it's like why do we have to worry

6647
06:26:55,980 --> 06:26:57,840
about something like that

6648
06:26:57,840 --> 06:26:59,820
and so therefore they don't understand

6649
06:26:59,820 --> 06:27:02,458
the nature of what they really need to

6650
06:27:02,458 --> 06:27:03,840
protect

6651
06:27:03,840 --> 06:27:07,200
me I usually go in and I just say I

6652
06:27:07,200 --> 06:27:09,058
spent less than two hours on Google and

6653
06:27:09,058 --> 06:27:10,740
came up with this fishing attack and had

6654
06:27:10,740 --> 06:27:13,080
your CEO click the link he's the one who

6655
06:27:13,080 --> 06:27:15,200
hired me to do the fishing engagement

6656
06:27:15,200 --> 06:27:18,298
it's like it's like uh there was one

6657
06:27:18,298 --> 06:27:20,940
it's like where I was like I walked in

6658
06:27:20,940 --> 06:27:22,798
to this Bank

6659
06:27:22,798 --> 06:27:26,520
I've never been there before and I

6660
06:27:26,520 --> 06:27:28,920
compromised all the machines and it was

6661
06:27:28,920 --> 06:27:30,900
bad and it's like and trust me you're

6662
06:27:30,900 --> 06:27:32,340
gonna see a video of that later it's

6663
06:27:32,340 --> 06:27:34,558
like that's something you have to take

6664
06:27:34,558 --> 06:27:36,660
seriously that is something you have to

6665
06:27:36,660 --> 06:27:38,820
fix now

6666
06:27:38,820 --> 06:27:41,040
people may think that you're zero days

6667
06:27:41,040 --> 06:27:42,420
and so are not something that they have

6668
06:27:42,420 --> 06:27:45,480
to worry about trust me the data shows

6669
06:27:45,480 --> 06:27:47,820
that out right it's like but when you

6670
06:27:47,820 --> 06:27:51,420
show someone how easy it is and how

6671
06:27:51,420 --> 06:27:53,940
basic it can be done that's something

6672
06:27:53,940 --> 06:27:55,200
they have to take a little bit more

6673
06:27:55,200 --> 06:27:57,000
seriously so I'm going to show you a

6674
06:27:57,000 --> 06:27:59,040
little bit of the network side it's like

6675
06:27:59,040 --> 06:28:00,840
if I'm going to do Focus mostly on just

6676
06:28:00,840 --> 06:28:03,000
doing physical compromise but you know

6677
06:28:03,000 --> 06:28:04,440
it's like a hacker conference already

6678
06:28:04,440 --> 06:28:06,540
like some you know computer stuff that's

6679
06:28:06,540 --> 06:28:08,340
like protect myself I'm gonna say I got

6680
06:28:08,340 --> 06:28:10,920
some of my Recon okay I use I use one of

6681
06:28:10,920 --> 06:28:13,378
the most elite hacking tools ever

6682
06:28:13,378 --> 06:28:15,180
developed in this world and stuff you

6683
06:28:15,180 --> 06:28:17,160
know and I use it regularly it's like

6684
06:28:17,160 --> 06:28:19,080
it's I mean y'all might want to write

6685
06:28:19,080 --> 06:28:20,820
down the Earl it's like it's a great

6686
06:28:20,820 --> 06:28:22,080
place it's going to start off when

6687
06:28:22,080 --> 06:28:23,458
you're doing a Recon for an engagement

6688
06:28:23,458 --> 06:28:25,600
it's

6689
06:28:25,600 --> 06:28:26,780
[Music]

6690
06:28:26,780 --> 06:28:31,260
g-o-o-g-l-e.com amazing okay it's where

6691
06:28:31,260 --> 06:28:33,600
I always start uh right here we're going

6692
06:28:33,600 --> 06:28:35,580
to hacky and why uh if you work for

6693
06:28:35,580 --> 06:28:37,138
Union Library you know don't raise your

6694
06:28:37,138 --> 06:28:39,660
hand I don't care uh it's like when I

6695
06:28:39,660 --> 06:28:42,298
was just starting out in 2001 or so it

6696
06:28:42,298 --> 06:28:43,740
was like uh like the first time I got

6697
06:28:43,740 --> 06:28:45,420
here at 2000 is information security

6698
06:28:45,420 --> 06:28:48,540
because I'm old uh but I do I try to get

6699
06:28:48,540 --> 06:28:50,520
a job at Ernst young and they didn't

6700
06:28:50,520 --> 06:28:51,958
want to hire me because it's like I

6701
06:28:51,958 --> 06:28:53,218
passed everything even the technical

6702
06:28:53,218 --> 06:28:55,920
stuff to leave it back then and but I

6703
06:28:55,920 --> 06:28:57,958
didn't have a high school uh diploma

6704
06:28:57,958 --> 06:29:00,000
it's like I was a GB you know High

6705
06:29:00,000 --> 06:29:01,558
School Dropout so and I didn't have any

6706
06:29:01,558 --> 06:29:03,480
college so they're like I'm not good

6707
06:29:03,480 --> 06:29:07,160
enough for us so I'm heavy

6708
06:29:10,580 --> 06:29:13,440
so we're gonna go after reading why uh

6709
06:29:13,440 --> 06:29:15,360
and see if I want to rob their building

6710
06:29:15,360 --> 06:29:17,160
physically but how do I do that I need

6711
06:29:17,160 --> 06:29:19,500
to find out information about them uh so

6712
06:29:19,500 --> 06:29:21,780
now why not wait for that I decided to

6713
06:29:21,780 --> 06:29:23,940
go after the New York office because I

6714
06:29:23,940 --> 06:29:25,740
actually went to one of their ex-hacking

6715
06:29:25,740 --> 06:29:28,378
trainings one time in 2003 and they got

6716
06:29:28,378 --> 06:29:29,700
really pissed off at me because I found

6717
06:29:29,700 --> 06:29:31,680
a vulnerability there in this SQL Server

6718
06:29:31,680 --> 06:29:33,420
that was internet facing that shouldn't

6719
06:29:33,420 --> 06:29:35,160
have been but that's another story that

6720
06:29:35,160 --> 06:29:37,500
they don't allow me to tell but screw

6721
06:29:37,500 --> 06:29:39,780
them again it's like when it happened in

6722
06:29:39,780 --> 06:29:40,920
New York so we're gonna go out to the

6723
06:29:40,920 --> 06:29:43,138
New York office and one of the things

6724
06:29:43,138 --> 06:29:45,958
that always gets me is how people think

6725
06:29:45,958 --> 06:29:47,700
perception matter so much it's like

6726
06:29:47,700 --> 06:29:49,920
because you see

6727
06:29:49,920 --> 06:29:51,500
Ernst and Young on the building right

6728
06:29:51,500 --> 06:29:54,780
fancy it's like Richard young owns that

6729
06:29:54,780 --> 06:29:57,600
building that's Mercy look you've seen

6730
06:29:57,600 --> 06:29:59,700
The Avengers Tony Stark's got his name

6731
06:29:59,700 --> 06:30:01,500
on the side of the building he's not the

6732
06:30:01,500 --> 06:30:03,660
one collecting rent he has to make sure

6733
06:30:03,660 --> 06:30:06,058
that the the Starbucks is is doing all

6734
06:30:06,058 --> 06:30:07,500
their job or hiring the maintenance

6735
06:30:07,500 --> 06:30:08,820
group he's actually not doing anything

6736
06:30:08,820 --> 06:30:10,940
now because he's fast but

6737
06:30:10,940 --> 06:30:14,100
it's like a skill hashtag too soon it's

6738
06:30:14,100 --> 06:30:16,798
like but still it's like he doesn't do

6739
06:30:16,798 --> 06:30:19,080
any of that no one does that they have

6740
06:30:19,080 --> 06:30:21,480
building management companies that

6741
06:30:21,480 --> 06:30:23,760
handle that

6742
06:30:23,760 --> 06:30:26,100
Ernst a young thinks security is very

6743
06:30:26,100 --> 06:30:27,240
important

6744
06:30:27,240 --> 06:30:29,458
building management companies think

6745
06:30:29,458 --> 06:30:32,540
selling office space is very important

6746
06:30:32,540 --> 06:30:36,600
see the disconnect here so I want to go

6747
06:30:36,600 --> 06:30:38,540
after the building management company

6748
06:30:38,540 --> 06:30:41,340
they're originally titled you know it's

6749
06:30:41,340 --> 06:30:43,920
like five times Square which is where

6750
06:30:43,920 --> 06:30:46,020
they're located so it's easy to find

6751
06:30:46,020 --> 06:30:48,420
them and one of the things that I love

6752
06:30:48,420 --> 06:30:49,920
that they tell me it's like some of the

6753
06:30:49,920 --> 06:30:52,138
things that you don't realize that

6754
06:30:52,138 --> 06:30:53,820
information you're giving out that can

6755
06:30:53,820 --> 06:30:55,798
be useful to someone trying to attack

6756
06:30:55,798 --> 06:30:58,680
somebody like telling me where all your

6757
06:30:58,680 --> 06:31:01,798
employees go to eat it's like you know

6758
06:31:01,798 --> 06:31:03,120
like why does that matter just like

6759
06:31:03,120 --> 06:31:04,440
that's not really where they go oh my

6760
06:31:04,440 --> 06:31:05,820
gosh yes this is exactly where they're

6761
06:31:05,820 --> 06:31:07,020
going to be because they're good company

6762
06:31:07,020 --> 06:31:09,240
workers it's like of course they're only

6763
06:31:09,240 --> 06:31:10,920
going to go somewhere right within like

6764
06:31:10,920 --> 06:31:12,718
a 5-10 minute radius and stuff you know

6765
06:31:12,718 --> 06:31:14,820
because they want to go be quick and go

6766
06:31:14,820 --> 06:31:16,200
back to work and stuff you know because

6767
06:31:16,200 --> 06:31:19,260
they're team players so now you've shown

6768
06:31:19,260 --> 06:31:21,298
me exactly where I can go to like you

6769
06:31:21,298 --> 06:31:23,280
know some you know malicious act

6770
06:31:23,280 --> 06:31:25,320
wireless access points you know do some

6771
06:31:25,320 --> 06:31:27,000
proc smart cloning get like take some

6772
06:31:27,000 --> 06:31:29,400
pictures badges it's like if I ever did

6773
06:31:29,400 --> 06:31:31,740
that things actually it's like but also

6774
06:31:31,740 --> 06:31:33,958
we're distinct uh from where to send

6775
06:31:33,958 --> 06:31:37,080
emails from saying hey you're a regular

6776
06:31:37,080 --> 06:31:39,420
customer at our location here's a five

6777
06:31:39,420 --> 06:31:41,340
dollar gift coupon and stuff you know

6780
06:31:45,718 --> 06:31:47,400

6781
06:31:47,400 --> 06:31:49,378
that it's five dollars I need an extra

6782
06:31:49,378 --> 06:31:51,360
burrito it's like I'm printing it okay

6783
06:31:51,360 --> 06:31:54,000
it's like you ask Bob an accounting how

6784
06:31:54,000 --> 06:31:55,680
quick that works right it's like Nothing

6785
06:31:55,680 --> 06:31:59,458
Stops or accounting people uh no it's

6786
06:31:59,458 --> 06:32:01,378
like right so it's like that better you

6787
06:32:01,378 --> 06:32:03,180
go right there but what else does it

6788
06:32:03,180 --> 06:32:06,360
show you oh that's your hotel look at

6789
06:32:06,360 --> 06:32:07,920
all the hotels that are like why is that

6790
06:32:07,920 --> 06:32:09,480
important because that's where all your

6791
06:32:09,480 --> 06:32:13,378
Executives from out of town are staying

6792
06:32:13,378 --> 06:32:15,900
and we all know how secure the Wi-Fi is

6793
06:32:15,900 --> 06:32:18,540
at hotels right it's like locked down

6794
06:32:18,540 --> 06:32:20,580
tight better than the Pentagon ain't

6795
06:32:20,580 --> 06:32:23,040
saying much but still no it's like not a

6796
06:32:23,040 --> 06:32:25,138
good thing it's like you know it's like

6797
06:32:25,138 --> 06:32:26,820
that is not a good place to be

6798
06:32:26,820 --> 06:32:28,320
advertising

6799
06:32:28,320 --> 06:32:30,000
um but you know what else that I loved

6800
06:32:30,000 --> 06:32:31,260
about this one because this one was

6801
06:32:31,260 --> 06:32:34,558
special for me because you know hey uh

6802
06:32:34,558 --> 06:32:36,520
they provided the blueprints

6803
06:32:36,520 --> 06:32:39,058
[Music]

6804
06:32:39,058 --> 06:32:41,458
I love you can tell there's some actual

6805
06:32:41,458 --> 06:32:42,780
physical red teamers here because

6806
06:32:42,780 --> 06:32:43,878
they're like

6807
06:32:43,878 --> 06:32:47,400
yeah they showed me exactly where

6808
06:32:47,400 --> 06:32:49,920
everything's located and and I love the

6809
06:32:49,920 --> 06:32:51,298
way that they do the Highlight I didn't

6810
06:32:51,298 --> 06:32:52,798
make it blue and yellow you know for the

6811
06:32:52,798 --> 06:32:54,058
cramp it's like they just did it that

6812
06:32:54,058 --> 06:32:56,040
way already so hey

6813
06:32:56,040 --> 06:32:57,840
um but it fits to the theme

6814
06:32:57,840 --> 06:32:59,160
um but one of the things that I've Loved

6815
06:32:59,160 --> 06:33:00,600
about it it's like this is how they use

6816
06:33:00,600 --> 06:33:02,160
Mind Tricks like this is their Jedi

6817
06:33:02,160 --> 06:33:03,780
Minecraft because you see that

6818
06:33:03,780 --> 06:33:06,240
highlighted Blue Area that's the street

6819
06:33:06,240 --> 06:33:07,740
level Lobby

6820
06:33:07,740 --> 06:33:09,420
but they want you to pay attention to

6821
06:33:09,420 --> 06:33:10,798
that and they like make it colder it's

6822
06:33:10,798 --> 06:33:13,138
like they're like screw that noise

6823
06:33:13,138 --> 06:33:14,940
it's like that whole Blue Area should be

6824
06:33:14,940 --> 06:33:16,378
red because that's like they got

6825
06:33:16,378 --> 06:33:18,600
Security in there it's like those guys

6826
06:33:18,600 --> 06:33:21,180
are mean they pay them extra to Loop me

6827
06:33:21,180 --> 06:33:23,458
it's like they ask questions when you

6828
06:33:23,458 --> 06:33:25,798
try to walk in and go up in the wrong

6829
06:33:25,798 --> 06:33:27,958
places I don't like that who likes that

6830
06:33:27,958 --> 06:33:30,718
no it's like I look at the gray area

6831
06:33:30,718 --> 06:33:32,878
that they're trying to distract you from

6832
06:33:32,878 --> 06:33:35,160
in the lower left-hand Corner which

6833
06:33:35,160 --> 06:33:37,680
actually shows oh there's the loading

6834
06:33:37,680 --> 06:33:39,840
dock there's the freight elevator

6835
06:33:39,840 --> 06:33:42,420
there's the mail room there's the

6836
06:33:42,420 --> 06:33:45,120
facilities I need to go to it's like the

6837
06:33:45,120 --> 06:33:46,378
same thing in the other areas like oh

6838
06:33:46,378 --> 06:33:48,180
there's all the back doors right there

6839
06:33:48,180 --> 06:33:49,500
on the left

6840
06:33:49,500 --> 06:33:52,200
thank you it's like I have always when

6841
06:33:52,200 --> 06:33:54,240
I'm breaking into a high-rise I always I

6842
06:33:54,240 --> 06:33:55,680
literally was robbing a place in Boston

6843
06:33:55,680 --> 06:33:58,200
and literally got the shoeshine guy to

6844
06:33:58,200 --> 06:34:00,240
get me into the loading dock so I can go

6845
06:34:00,240 --> 06:34:02,218
right up the freight elevator but look

6846
06:34:02,218 --> 06:34:04,680
on the guy who paid us his face when he

6847
06:34:04,680 --> 06:34:06,240
came back from his meeting the family in

6848
06:34:06,240 --> 06:34:08,820
this chair was chef's kiss it was

6849
06:34:08,820 --> 06:34:11,520
amazing uh but all through the freight

6850
06:34:11,520 --> 06:34:12,840
elevator

6851
06:34:12,840 --> 06:34:15,660
but they didn't stop there they showed

6852
06:34:15,660 --> 06:34:19,080
you blueprints of all the forms now why

6853
06:34:19,080 --> 06:34:22,440
is that important well for one thing it

6854
06:34:22,440 --> 06:34:25,200
lets me become familiar with the

6855
06:34:25,200 --> 06:34:28,200
surroundings and when someone comes and

6856
06:34:28,200 --> 06:34:30,718
questions you and say hey what are you

6857
06:34:30,718 --> 06:34:32,458
doing here it's like oh I'm going down

6858
06:34:32,458 --> 06:34:33,718
to the right and said you know by the

6859
06:34:33,718 --> 06:34:34,798
conference room because I got into the

6860
06:34:34,798 --> 06:34:36,298
lecture of the positive doing an audit

6861
06:34:36,298 --> 06:34:39,240
and like oh okay they're more likely to

6862
06:34:39,240 --> 06:34:41,878
let you go because why because down to

6863
06:34:41,878 --> 06:34:44,400
the right by the conference center uh a

6864
06:34:44,400 --> 06:34:46,740
conference area there's an electrical

6865
06:34:46,740 --> 06:34:48,120
closet

6866
06:34:48,120 --> 06:34:50,458
how would you know that unless you've

6867
06:34:50,458 --> 06:34:52,820
been there

6868
06:34:53,160 --> 06:34:55,440
like a manager company thank you it's

6869
06:34:55,440 --> 06:34:57,718
like uh so yeah that's really great and

6870
06:34:57,718 --> 06:34:58,920
you notice how they're still doing the

6871
06:34:58,920 --> 06:35:01,500
Jedi mind trick thing right look at all

6872
06:35:01,500 --> 06:35:03,298
that dark area

6873
06:35:03,298 --> 06:35:05,760
hereby dragons to make here this is no

6874
06:35:05,760 --> 06:35:08,458
nothing to see here citizens uh but they

6875
06:35:08,458 --> 06:35:09,900
still want to sell space so they

6876
06:35:09,900 --> 06:35:12,480
eventually uncensor it for you uh which

6877
06:35:12,480 --> 06:35:14,820
I thought was adorable thank you uh so

6878
06:35:14,820 --> 06:35:17,100
now you can see a very nice clear view

6879
06:35:17,100 --> 06:35:19,320
of where the Mel room is and which way

6880
06:35:19,320 --> 06:35:21,058
you're going to turn from the freight

6881
06:35:21,058 --> 06:35:23,280
elevator is like uh to get into the

6882
06:35:23,280 --> 06:35:25,260
facility and also for the restroom park

6883
06:35:25,260 --> 06:35:26,580
because like I drew bought a Backpage

6884
06:35:26,580 --> 06:35:28,440
and that's a good place to know too uh

6885
06:35:28,440 --> 06:35:29,458
yes

6886
06:35:29,458 --> 06:35:32,580
that's perfect and the let's get one of

6887
06:35:32,580 --> 06:35:34,080
the scariest things was

6888
06:35:34,080 --> 06:35:37,080
I can do this in your lobby

6889
06:35:37,080 --> 06:35:39,240
it's like we're in a Panera Bread you

6890
06:35:39,240 --> 06:35:41,520
know having pizza and Diet Pepsi on one

6891
06:35:41,520 --> 06:35:44,160
of my little mini devices and I did this

6892
06:35:44,160 --> 06:35:46,080
other one was I was uh checking it out

6893
06:35:46,080 --> 06:35:47,940
it's like in a hotel room in Stockholm

6894
06:35:47,940 --> 06:35:50,520
it's like I've got this little bitty

6895
06:35:50,520 --> 06:35:53,100
computers like strapped on my side and

6896
06:35:53,100 --> 06:35:55,020
my little e holster because you know I'm

6897
06:35:55,020 --> 06:35:57,840
from Texas uh but it's like and the

6898
06:35:57,840 --> 06:36:00,298
whole thing is it's because when I'm in

6899
06:36:00,298 --> 06:36:01,500
those lobbies and I'm in those places

6900
06:36:01,500 --> 06:36:03,480
with equipment that doesn't look like a

6901
06:36:03,480 --> 06:36:06,600
computer it's like I can start doing

6902
06:36:06,600 --> 06:36:09,660
research and Recon lobbying should be

6903
06:36:09,660 --> 06:36:11,638
just for getting people from the front

6904
06:36:11,638 --> 06:36:14,400
registering them and sending them up but

6905
06:36:14,400 --> 06:36:16,920
we put Starbucks there we put like

6906
06:36:16,920 --> 06:36:19,680
little uh shops we put little cafes and

6907
06:36:19,680 --> 06:36:22,558
I'm like thank you so much because now I

6908
06:36:22,558 --> 06:36:24,660
can spend hours just sitting there

6909
06:36:24,660 --> 06:36:26,878
drinking my mocha latte no actually I'll

6910
06:36:26,878 --> 06:36:28,320
talk with it I don't like this thing

6911
06:36:28,320 --> 06:36:29,580
it's like you know just drinking that

6912
06:36:29,580 --> 06:36:31,740
and it's like and just cracking the foot

6913
06:36:31,740 --> 06:36:33,240
traffic to see what people are wearing

6914
06:36:33,240 --> 06:36:35,820
to see what security guards uh patterns

6915
06:36:35,820 --> 06:36:38,340
are how attention there are it's like

6916
06:36:38,340 --> 06:36:39,900
checking all that out while I'm probably

6917
06:36:39,900 --> 06:36:42,058
running malicious attack wirelessly as

6918
06:36:42,058 --> 06:36:43,500
well because you know playing hide you

6919
06:36:43,500 --> 06:36:44,820
know on boards I was like I gotta they

6920
06:36:44,820 --> 06:36:46,138
need to see like everybody else in this

6921
06:36:46,138 --> 06:36:48,480
industry it's like so so yes so I'm

6922
06:36:48,480 --> 06:36:50,280
going to be doing things like that

6923
06:36:50,280 --> 06:36:52,980
so that was just one thing you've got to

6924
06:36:52,980 --> 06:36:55,200
be careful about because you never know

6925
06:36:55,200 --> 06:36:57,600
women attackers want to show up in your

6926
06:36:57,600 --> 06:37:01,080
area going like hmm what can I do it's

6927
06:37:01,080 --> 06:37:03,780
like I mean why take down it's like uh

6928
06:37:03,780 --> 06:37:05,580
that's your office right now my

6929
06:37:05,580 --> 06:37:07,798
Waterfront very beautiful building and

6930
06:37:07,798 --> 06:37:09,718
during oh wait I didn't go to an

6931
06:37:09,718 --> 06:37:11,400
interior I don't know

6932
06:37:11,400 --> 06:37:12,660
[Music]

6933
06:37:12,660 --> 06:37:14,340
um but Matt let's go and look at some of

6934
06:37:14,340 --> 06:37:16,080
the social stuff

6935
06:37:16,080 --> 06:37:18,718
um got to hit the socials because you

6936
06:37:18,718 --> 06:37:20,760
know it's like well Twitter still exists

6937
06:37:20,760 --> 06:37:22,320
anyway we got to keep hitting them uh

6938
06:37:22,320 --> 06:37:24,600
but here's it on Instagram I love that

6939
06:37:24,600 --> 06:37:26,280
people talk about like how they go in

6940
06:37:26,280 --> 06:37:28,920
and they have to break into a network to

6941
06:37:28,920 --> 06:37:31,320
do network discovery

6942
06:37:31,320 --> 06:37:33,240
you're literally breaking into a network

6943
06:37:33,240 --> 06:37:34,980
to see what devices are on the network

6944
06:37:34,980 --> 06:37:36,600
or what kind of Technologies they use

6945
06:37:36,600 --> 06:37:40,558
look have you heard of LinkedIn

6946
06:37:40,558 --> 06:37:43,080
their job hosting tells you exactly what

6947
06:37:43,080 --> 06:37:45,780
technology they have the people that

6948
06:37:45,780 --> 06:37:47,280
they've currently have hired for

6949
06:37:47,280 --> 06:37:49,860
positions telling you exactly what

6950
06:37:49,860 --> 06:37:52,320
firewalls are using why antivirus you're

6951
06:37:52,320 --> 06:37:54,240
using what Office Products what

6952
06:37:54,240 --> 06:37:56,340
programming languages are using they're

6953
06:37:56,340 --> 06:37:58,138
all telling you that

6954
06:37:58,138 --> 06:38:00,120
and then you also have Instagram and

6955
06:38:00,120 --> 06:38:01,440
stuff you know showing you where your

6956
06:38:01,440 --> 06:38:02,820
employees are and what they're inside

6957
06:38:02,820 --> 06:38:05,458
their buildings look like as well

6958
06:38:05,458 --> 06:38:07,558
and also what happened there something

6959
06:38:07,558 --> 06:38:09,000
happened there looks like something

6960
06:38:09,000 --> 06:38:12,000
happened there it wasn't me yeah

6961
06:38:12,000 --> 06:38:13,920
okay it's like but they're also showing

6962
06:38:13,920 --> 06:38:15,840
what kind of devices they're using

6963
06:38:15,840 --> 06:38:18,298
Lenovo uh laptops uh for this one

6964
06:38:18,298 --> 06:38:20,580
company which she's like oh scary right

6965
06:38:20,580 --> 06:38:22,378
now right it's like still hashtag too

6966
06:38:22,378 --> 06:38:24,718
soon uh but also they got Dale and some

6967
06:38:24,718 --> 06:38:26,820
MacBooks and some iPhones It's like

6968
06:38:26,820 --> 06:38:28,860
because it doesn't it's like so they got

6969
06:38:28,860 --> 06:38:30,600
all those devices so you're already

6970
06:38:30,600 --> 06:38:32,100
knowing what their architecture what

6971
06:38:32,100 --> 06:38:34,138
kind of equipment they're using

6972
06:38:34,138 --> 06:38:36,240
um but one of the other things the main

6973
06:38:36,240 --> 06:38:40,138
reason why you use social media okay uh

6974
06:38:40,138 --> 06:38:42,058
and I mean and also probably one of the

6975
06:38:42,058 --> 06:38:43,820
main reasons why security people drink

6976
06:38:43,820 --> 06:38:47,820
uh hashtag

6977
06:38:47,820 --> 06:38:51,000
that's why we drink pillows I'm still up

6978
06:38:51,000 --> 06:38:53,218
y'all still hear me yeah okay good

6979
06:38:53,218 --> 06:38:54,740
ethics I don't care

6980
06:38:54,740 --> 06:38:59,718
so one no I'm going to start huh

6981
06:39:00,500 --> 06:39:03,120
oh I don't uh

6982
06:39:03,120 --> 06:39:05,240
he stole it

6983
06:39:05,240 --> 06:39:07,500
that guy right there with glasses he

6984
06:39:07,500 --> 06:39:09,058
said look how that speaks looking I said

6985
06:39:09,058 --> 06:39:11,218
that sounds about this okay so one of

6986
06:39:11,218 --> 06:39:13,860
the things that gets me is you look for

6987
06:39:13,860 --> 06:39:17,218
hashtag new badge and you're like a

6988
06:39:17,218 --> 06:39:19,798
smorgasbord of Sorrow because you see

6989
06:39:19,798 --> 06:39:22,080
all these people posting their Badges

6990
06:39:22,080 --> 06:39:24,420
and you've got one guy over here it's

6991
06:39:24,420 --> 06:39:26,400
like they're actually posting the keys

6992
06:39:26,400 --> 06:39:28,400
to the building

6993
06:39:28,400 --> 06:39:31,760
and you're like why is that a big deal

6994
06:39:31,760 --> 06:39:34,200
remember when Department of Homeland

6995
06:39:34,200 --> 06:39:36,540
Security decided to print all the uh

6996
06:39:36,540 --> 06:39:39,540
show all the TSA Keys guess who's got

6997
06:39:39,540 --> 06:39:42,660
all the 3D printed TSA keys do you

6998
06:39:42,660 --> 06:39:44,700
really want me having that

6999
06:39:44,700 --> 06:39:46,820
your log is

7000
06:39:46,820 --> 06:39:50,760
no it's like and remember that's the

7001
06:39:50,760 --> 06:39:53,100
same government my government yay it's

7002
06:39:53,100 --> 06:39:55,080
like that wants all your digital Keys as

7003
06:39:55,080 --> 06:39:57,000
well I'm sure you'll handle it way

7004
06:39:57,000 --> 06:40:00,058
better than the luggage keys right yeah

7005
06:40:00,058 --> 06:40:03,120
it's like we're confronted by that

7006
06:40:03,120 --> 06:40:05,218
Department of Homeland Security did ever

7007
06:40:05,218 --> 06:40:06,420
the only thing that they could do

7008
06:40:06,420 --> 06:40:09,840
logically uh they said well that wasn't

7009
06:40:09,840 --> 06:40:11,340
really meant for security that was

7010
06:40:11,340 --> 06:40:13,138
convenient so we're not going to change

7011
06:40:13,138 --> 06:40:14,878
the lives because that would cause you

7012
06:40:14,878 --> 06:40:17,400
know effort uh so I'm sure that

7013
06:40:17,400 --> 06:40:18,718
something happened to vision of keys

7014
06:40:18,718 --> 06:40:21,000
they would take responsibility for it

7015
06:40:21,000 --> 06:40:23,820
um but I digress very Grant you today

7016
06:40:23,820 --> 06:40:25,558
it's like so let's go and see what else

7017
06:40:25,558 --> 06:40:28,280
because you look at all these badges

7018
06:40:28,280 --> 06:40:29,820
Jason

7019
06:40:29,820 --> 06:40:31,080
come on

7020
06:40:31,080 --> 06:40:34,500
I'll tell you impatient people

7021
06:40:34,500 --> 06:40:38,940
I got the badgie 100. the only way this

7022
06:40:38,940 --> 06:40:41,160
could be core if it was called the badge

7023
06:40:41,160 --> 06:40:44,940
3000 okay that is the only way

7024
06:40:44,940 --> 06:40:47,400
because they're talking from taking a

7025
06:40:47,400 --> 06:40:50,160
picture off a histogram to printing it

7026
06:40:50,160 --> 06:40:52,680
in new bags with your name on it it's

7027
06:40:52,680 --> 06:40:53,940
like

7028
06:40:53,940 --> 06:40:55,860
15 minutes

7029
06:40:55,860 --> 06:40:58,620
and you're owning it and I and I love my

7030
06:40:58,620 --> 06:41:00,180
detractors because you know they're

7031
06:41:00,180 --> 06:41:02,218
adorable too and it's like and I love

7032
06:41:02,218 --> 06:41:03,660
the ones that are like well yeah but

7033
06:41:03,660 --> 06:41:06,058
Jason are you are using a proximity like

7034
06:41:06,058 --> 06:41:08,700
you're cloning it to your no

7035
06:41:08,700 --> 06:41:11,700
I don't put HIV on I don't do that yet I

7036
06:41:11,700 --> 06:41:14,700
don't do no I literally make sure that

7037
06:41:14,700 --> 06:41:16,440
it doesn't because I don't need it

7038
06:41:16,440 --> 06:41:19,798
because I'm gonna walk up

7039
06:41:19,798 --> 06:41:21,900
to the badger here and I'm going to be

7040
06:41:21,900 --> 06:41:25,040
dressed nice and I'm like

7041
06:41:27,900 --> 06:41:29,400
me

7042
06:41:29,400 --> 06:41:31,138
look at security

7043
06:41:31,138 --> 06:41:32,820
hello

7044
06:41:32,820 --> 06:41:34,920
I've got a meeting in five minutes it's

7045
06:41:34,920 --> 06:41:37,440
like I need

7046
06:41:37,440 --> 06:41:40,160
white guy in a suit hello

7047
06:41:40,160 --> 06:41:42,420
hey what's he used to having White

7048
06:41:42,420 --> 06:41:43,740
Privilege if you can't talk about how

7049
06:41:43,740 --> 06:41:46,458
horrible it is right it's like hey

7050
06:41:46,458 --> 06:41:48,840
and then use it to open the door for you

7051
06:41:48,840 --> 06:41:50,218
it's very nice of them I really

7052
06:41:50,218 --> 06:41:51,540
appreciate it

7053
06:41:51,540 --> 06:41:53,400
um it's like so yeah it's like I don't

7054
06:41:53,400 --> 06:41:54,660
do the lock picking thing because I'm

7055
06:41:54,660 --> 06:41:55,920
not that great with it it's like I

7056
06:41:55,920 --> 06:41:57,360
usually just get them to open the door

7057
06:41:57,360 --> 06:41:59,458
it's much funner

7058
06:41:59,458 --> 06:42:01,138
um now I want I want to ask a question

7059
06:42:01,138 --> 06:42:03,180
with you it's like it's like do you

7060
06:42:03,180 --> 06:42:04,860
think where you work is more secure from

7061
06:42:04,860 --> 06:42:06,900
infiltration and compromise than a bank

7062
06:42:06,900 --> 06:42:09,480
which understands and is aware that

7063
06:42:09,480 --> 06:42:11,340
people will try to rob it

7064
06:42:11,340 --> 06:42:13,920
because I Through The Years believe it

7065
06:42:13,920 --> 06:42:16,138
or not I've told a few stories during my

7066
06:42:16,138 --> 06:42:19,440
talks and if you haven't been one of the

7067
06:42:19,440 --> 06:42:21,120
people that are going like Jason that is

7068
06:42:21,120 --> 06:42:22,558
total BS

7069
06:42:22,558 --> 06:42:24,540
I'm surprised because that's what I say

7070
06:42:24,540 --> 06:42:26,458
every time that it happens to me and I

7071
06:42:26,458 --> 06:42:27,780
was there

7072
06:42:27,780 --> 06:42:30,540
okay but I want to talk and I have a lot

7073
06:42:30,540 --> 06:42:32,340
of people that talk about like how I'm

7074
06:42:32,340 --> 06:42:33,718
not technical

7075
06:42:33,718 --> 06:42:35,540
it's like I don't know how to program

7076
06:42:35,540 --> 06:42:37,860
it's like I don't know any of the

7077
06:42:37,860 --> 06:42:39,420
languages it's like I barely could

7078
06:42:39,420 --> 06:42:41,700
handle English okay I'm from Texas it's

7079
06:42:41,700 --> 06:42:43,920
like oh no I don't I don't do that it's

7080
06:42:43,920 --> 06:42:46,378
like but let's see how effective we can

7081
06:42:46,378 --> 06:42:51,120
be doing a basic attack walking in and

7082
06:42:51,120 --> 06:42:53,218
see how that goes and I want y'all to

7083
06:42:53,218 --> 06:42:55,080
make sure that your timing and see how

7084
06:42:55,080 --> 06:42:57,298
long it takes for me to walk into a

7085
06:42:57,298 --> 06:43:00,120
branch that is currently closed it's

7086
06:43:00,120 --> 06:43:03,120
like to getting a compromise and

7087
06:43:03,120 --> 06:43:05,638
compromising the first machine let's see

7088
06:43:05,638 --> 06:43:07,740
how many minutes or hours it takes to do

7089
06:43:07,740 --> 06:43:09,540
that one

7090
06:43:09,540 --> 06:43:12,540
so here we go we're going to walk in

7091
06:43:12,540 --> 06:43:15,180
here and I can't see the things that

7092
06:43:15,180 --> 06:43:16,860
we're not going to have sound but look

7093
06:43:16,860 --> 06:43:20,100
at her she's amazing she is the star of

7094
06:43:20,100 --> 06:43:22,680
this show because she knew I was sketchy

7095
06:43:22,680 --> 06:43:25,138
AF as soon as I walked in

7096
06:43:25,138 --> 06:43:27,718
did you see the look on her face she

7097
06:43:27,718 --> 06:43:29,878
knew I was trouble oh by the way 15

7098
06:43:29,878 --> 06:43:31,980
seconds if you're counting how long it

7099
06:43:31,980 --> 06:43:33,660
took for me to walk up the front door to

7100
06:43:33,660 --> 06:43:35,458
compromise the first machine the answer

7101
06:43:35,458 --> 06:43:38,340
was 15 seconds uh here I am at 20

7102
06:43:38,340 --> 06:43:41,760
seconds the payload is executing

7103
06:43:41,760 --> 06:43:43,798
because it's like

7104
06:43:43,798 --> 06:43:46,860
25 seconds is done

7105
06:43:46,860 --> 06:43:49,260
and under 30 seconds I compromised the

7106
06:43:49,260 --> 06:43:50,940
first machine in the bank

7107
06:43:50,940 --> 06:43:53,280
and then here she comes

7108
06:43:53,280 --> 06:43:55,740
making her coming out of her way to come

7109
06:43:55,740 --> 06:43:58,080
and stop me and question me another

7110
06:43:58,080 --> 06:43:59,940
amazing thing that everyone should be

7111
06:43:59,940 --> 06:44:01,680
doing and of course I tell her my

7112
06:44:01,680 --> 06:44:04,378
assertive girls I'm doing a USB audit

7113
06:44:04,378 --> 06:44:06,780
what's what's a USB audit I have no idea

7114
06:44:06,780 --> 06:44:09,360
I do a lot of them okay every engagement

7115
06:44:09,360 --> 06:44:12,780
and it's like and I'm not

7116
06:44:12,780 --> 06:44:15,120
crumbling I'm not showing that I'm I'm

7117
06:44:15,120 --> 06:44:17,218
I've been caught I'm actually being

7118
06:44:17,218 --> 06:44:19,680
assertive going like I didn't be talking

7119
06:44:19,680 --> 06:44:21,718
headquarters do you talked to manager

7120
06:44:21,718 --> 06:44:23,400
I'm supposed to be here and she's like

7121
06:44:23,400 --> 06:44:25,260
well you need to go talk to my manager

7122
06:44:25,260 --> 06:44:27,120
another right thing that you're supposed

7123
06:44:27,120 --> 06:44:28,920
to do and I'm like sure I will talk to

7124
06:44:28,920 --> 06:44:30,058
management

7125
06:44:30,058 --> 06:44:31,920
but here's where she made the one

7126
06:44:31,920 --> 06:44:33,780
mistake

7127
06:44:33,780 --> 06:44:36,780
she goes and gets detention and then I

7128
06:44:36,780 --> 06:44:39,058
assure her that I'll Stand By and she

7129
06:44:39,058 --> 06:44:40,620
could leave

7130
06:44:40,620 --> 06:44:43,700
and she thought I was going to be honest

7131
06:44:43,700 --> 06:44:47,218
so I immediately go in and I switched to

7132
06:44:47,218 --> 06:44:49,798
a passive one can I compromise the

7133
06:44:49,798 --> 06:44:50,900
manager

7134
06:44:50,900 --> 06:44:53,878
because a manager thinks that she it

7135
06:44:53,878 --> 06:44:56,340
better than me she thinks the manager is

7136
06:44:56,340 --> 06:44:57,490
going to Pat me

7137
06:44:57,490 --> 06:45:00,540
[Music]

7138
06:45:00,540 --> 06:45:02,878
so I'm just and I'm from Microsoft and

7139
06:45:02,878 --> 06:45:04,740
trying to make the network faster

7140
06:45:04,740 --> 06:45:07,260
well you could be on a T1 3 direct line

7141
06:45:07,260 --> 06:45:09,120
and five up to your desktop you ask

7142
06:45:09,120 --> 06:45:10,798
someone hey is the network running slow

7143
06:45:10,798 --> 06:45:13,440
yeah I think it is just a little bit I'm

7144
06:45:13,440 --> 06:45:16,400
here to make it faster what do you need

7145
06:45:16,400 --> 06:45:19,320
me I need network servers so I have to

7146
06:45:19,320 --> 06:45:22,160
go and say the data center

7147
06:45:22,798 --> 06:45:24,660
I'm here to make the network pass to

7148
06:45:24,660 --> 06:45:26,580
people a serious business

7149
06:45:26,580 --> 06:45:28,620
that's my trusted agent because once

7150
06:45:28,620 --> 06:45:30,240
again it's an educational experience I

7151
06:45:30,240 --> 06:45:31,320
don't want to get topless because I'm

7152
06:45:31,320 --> 06:45:33,240
crouching my bruise easily but he's way

7153
06:45:33,240 --> 06:45:34,320
too close because he can't forget

7154
06:45:34,320 --> 06:45:36,378
believe what's going on right now either

7155
06:45:36,378 --> 06:45:38,760
uh and then I get the manager going this

7156
06:45:38,760 --> 06:45:40,500
is from the National Geographic show

7157
06:45:40,500 --> 06:45:42,298
this is an unaired footage that Darren

7158
06:45:42,298 --> 06:45:43,740
kitchen was nice enough to acquire

7159
06:45:43,740 --> 06:45:46,620
somehow and so this is all unedited

7160
06:45:46,620 --> 06:45:47,520
because I want you to think I tried to

7161
06:45:47,520 --> 06:45:49,440
make it look cooler uh so sorry for the

7162
06:45:49,440 --> 06:45:50,878
butt cam

7163
06:45:50,878 --> 06:45:53,820
um but it's unedited this is the whole

7164
06:45:53,820 --> 06:45:55,218
thing

7165
06:45:55,218 --> 06:45:59,180
so we get to the data center

7166
06:45:59,878 --> 06:46:02,940
it's got a nice secured uh

7167
06:46:02,940 --> 06:46:05,040
lock panel that I did not know the PIN

7168
06:46:05,040 --> 06:46:07,080
for it's like I think it was uh son's

7169
06:46:07,080 --> 06:46:08,218
birthday

7170
06:46:08,218 --> 06:46:09,080
um

7171
06:46:09,080 --> 06:46:12,240
I wasn't looking because you know

7172
06:46:12,240 --> 06:46:14,760
and then he lets me into and I was like

7173
06:46:14,760 --> 06:46:16,978
will you let me in here by myself

7174
06:46:16,978 --> 06:46:19,020
I'll go get you in a second

7175
06:46:19,020 --> 06:46:21,478
and he left me myself the one thing you

7176
06:46:21,478 --> 06:46:23,040
came here in the audible is the audible

7177
06:46:23,040 --> 06:46:25,320
side like

7178
06:46:25,320 --> 06:46:28,020
because I want them to do well

7179
06:46:28,020 --> 06:46:32,160
and it's like and this is not going good

7180
06:46:32,160 --> 06:46:35,280
so but then I also realized that lady

7181
06:46:35,280 --> 06:46:38,040
was freaking sharp as attack it's like

7182
06:46:38,040 --> 06:46:39,840
she may now go to the cause of anger

7183
06:46:39,840 --> 06:46:41,700
like who was that guy so I was like I

7184
06:46:41,700 --> 06:46:43,080
need to catch up with him he's my golden

7185
06:46:43,080 --> 06:46:45,478
ticket it's like so I hurried up to

7186
06:46:45,478 --> 06:46:47,400
catch up with him

7187
06:46:47,400 --> 06:46:48,718
it's like oh you're staying with me

7188
06:46:48,718 --> 06:46:51,240
buddy good it's like let's get going now

7189
06:46:51,240 --> 06:46:53,218
behind the teller line

7190
06:46:53,218 --> 06:46:55,260
because having a bad robbing a bank you

7191
06:46:55,260 --> 06:46:56,458
know being a sourced by the manager

7192
06:46:56,458 --> 06:46:57,958
behind the telephone line never ends

7193
06:46:57,958 --> 06:47:00,120
badly for people

7194
06:47:00,120 --> 06:47:03,058
at least a robber so you know and here I

7195
06:47:03,058 --> 06:47:06,420
go start compromising the machines there

7196
06:47:06,420 --> 06:47:09,377
that's fine

7197
06:47:09,958 --> 06:47:12,900
now I have to say I I don't mean I I try

7198
06:47:12,900 --> 06:47:15,478
not to lose my cool uh during the day

7199
06:47:15,478 --> 06:47:17,040
this one was really hard because I was

7200
06:47:17,040 --> 06:47:19,500
so upset at the rudeness I experienced

7201
06:47:19,500 --> 06:47:22,798
here it's like on this next one

7202
06:47:22,798 --> 06:47:25,978
this freaking ungrateful un very not

7203
06:47:25,978 --> 06:47:28,320
nice employee had the audacity to lock

7204
06:47:28,320 --> 06:47:30,478
his workstation while I'm trying to rob

7205
06:47:30,478 --> 06:47:32,718
him

7206
06:47:32,878 --> 06:47:34,260
how rude

7207
06:47:34,260 --> 06:47:35,940
but it's okay it's okay I got the

7208
06:47:35,940 --> 06:47:37,440
manager to go get the employee if that

7209
06:47:37,440 --> 06:47:39,000
was on break to come and unlock the

7210
06:47:39,000 --> 06:47:42,080
computer for me uh so that was good

7211
06:47:42,080 --> 06:47:44,400
okay he's like

7212
06:47:44,400 --> 06:47:45,840
oh yeah

7213
06:47:45,840 --> 06:47:47,700
I'm so glad I kept my cool because it's

7214
06:47:47,700 --> 06:47:49,320
like that would have been messy it's

7215
06:47:49,320 --> 06:47:53,218
like um yes because you Lebanon is like

7216
06:47:53,218 --> 06:47:54,478

7217
06:47:54,478 --> 06:47:55,620
world it's like speak more than one

7218
06:47:55,620 --> 06:47:57,058
language and I tell people like I'm

7219
06:47:57,058 --> 06:47:58,500
sorry I'm from America I'm going to

7220
06:47:58,500 --> 06:48:00,058
speak one language I'm from Texas I

7221
06:48:00,058 --> 06:48:02,340
don't speak it very well uh it's all

7222
06:48:02,340 --> 06:48:03,840
like to make jokes because it shows that

7223
06:48:03,840 --> 06:48:06,120
I'm like very affable disappearing I'm a

06:48:08,458 --> 06:48:10,020
like now we're going to know where the

7226
06:48:10,020 --> 06:48:12,478
vault is and if you think that bolt is a

7227
06:48:12,478 --> 06:48:15,298
big shiny place you are mistaken

7228
06:48:15,298 --> 06:48:17,638
this is the Vault and this is the most

7229
06:48:17,638 --> 06:48:20,280
powerful employee in the bank

7230
06:48:20,280 --> 06:48:23,940
this city right here you know why

7231
06:48:23,940 --> 06:48:26,878
she's doing the wire transfers

7232
06:48:26,878 --> 06:48:28,740
for the company

7233
06:48:28,740 --> 06:48:31,080

dollars in a till when I can get wired a

7274
06:50:11,580 --> 06:50:15,440

7277
06:50:21,478 --> 06:50:23,820
none

7278
06:50:23,820 --> 06:50:28,200
there was nothing that I did that not

7279
06:50:28,200 --> 06:50:30,660
one person in here couldn't walk don't

7280
06:50:30,660 --> 06:50:33,240
do it okay especially don't get caught

7281
06:50:33,240 --> 06:50:36,780
saying Jason told me I could do it

7282
06:50:36,780 --> 06:50:39,000
but there is literally

7283
06:50:39,000 --> 06:50:41,040
nothing

7284
06:50:41,040 --> 06:50:45,840
that I did that any of y'all couldn't do

7285
06:50:45,840 --> 06:50:49,500
it's like I used a a money script that I

7286
06:50:49,500 --> 06:50:51,600
uh ducky script that I got a hack five

7287
06:50:51,600 --> 06:50:54,718
it just ended the notepad payload in

7288
06:50:54,718 --> 06:50:57,478
notepad in their tool it's like and that

7289
06:50:57,478 --> 06:50:59,100
was it

7290
06:50:59,100 --> 06:51:01,260
if I wanted to actually do more of a

7291
06:51:01,260 --> 06:51:02,760
Payless do more of a thing I could have

7292
06:51:02,760 --> 06:51:05,340
done that but I'm trying to be there as

7293
06:51:05,340 --> 06:51:08,280
a teacher not as someone that's testing

7294
06:51:08,280 --> 06:51:10,260
so when you hear all these people

7295
06:51:10,260 --> 06:51:12,540
talking about all these links skills

7296
06:51:12,540 --> 06:51:14,760
that are going to understand

7297
06:51:14,760 --> 06:51:17,520
it's like that may have been years of

7298
06:51:17,520 --> 06:51:19,138
failures that got them to the point

7299
06:51:19,138 --> 06:51:22,260
where they can do those things well

7300
06:51:22,260 --> 06:51:24,478
it's like there is nothing stopping

7301
06:51:24,478 --> 06:51:26,340
anyone in here from doing the same kind

7302
06:51:26,340 --> 06:51:29,280
of thing okay it's like I mainly do my

7303
06:51:29,280 --> 06:51:32,340
job through you know I have no shame and

7304
06:51:32,340 --> 06:51:34,260
bad impulse control I mean those are the

7305
06:51:34,260 --> 06:51:36,840
main qualifiers for my job it's like so

7306
06:51:36,840 --> 06:51:38,520
if you got that and you're in this

7307
06:51:38,520 --> 06:51:40,320
industry there's a good chance you got

7308
06:51:40,320 --> 06:51:42,660
that it's like you can do these things

7309
06:51:42,660 --> 06:51:44,520
don't make it like it's someone

7310
06:51:44,520 --> 06:51:46,500
something special with the dark arts

7311
06:51:46,500 --> 06:51:48,360
which should be opening up for more

7312
06:51:48,360 --> 06:51:50,340
people to do the stuff not trying to

7313
06:51:50,340 --> 06:51:51,958
limit who could do what I've been

7314
06:51:51,958 --> 06:51:53,520
intimidate from thinking that this stuff

7315
06:51:53,520 --> 06:51:56,580
is something that not everybody can do

7316
06:51:56,580 --> 06:51:58,978
and we're going to show another one and

7317
06:51:58,978 --> 06:52:02,160
this is how once again I use people and

7318
06:52:02,160 --> 06:52:03,718
perception

7319
06:52:03,718 --> 06:52:06,420
I'm coming in from the public area I

7320
06:52:06,420 --> 06:52:09,000
ignore the tellers at first

7321
06:52:09,000 --> 06:52:10,740
but I stand here to the lady on her

7322
06:52:10,740 --> 06:52:12,840
phone behind me and in the battle she

7323
06:52:12,840 --> 06:52:15,240
doesn't see me but I'm hiding behind

7324
06:52:15,240 --> 06:52:17,218
this column so the teller people can't

7325
06:52:17,218 --> 06:52:20,280
see where I'm at I've waited several

7326
06:52:20,280 --> 06:52:22,620
seconds and then I walk around from the

7327
06:52:22,620 --> 06:52:24,718
private area like I was coming to that

7328
06:52:24,718 --> 06:52:27,058
lady who was on her phone and I walked

7329
06:52:27,058 --> 06:52:29,580
straight into the color line

7330
06:52:29,580 --> 06:52:32,520
and I'm like I go to the very far end I

7331
06:52:32,520 --> 06:52:34,080
say hello I make sure that they know

7332
06:52:34,080 --> 06:52:36,780
that I'm initiating contact one of the

7333
06:52:36,780 --> 06:52:38,040
best counter social engineering

7334
06:52:38,040 --> 06:52:39,780
maneuvers you could ever do is going hey

7335
06:52:39,780 --> 06:52:40,798
how you doing

7336
06:52:40,798 --> 06:52:43,080
perfect because you're initiating

7337
06:52:43,080 --> 06:52:45,000
conversation if you're trying to be a

7338
06:52:45,000 --> 06:52:46,620
bad guy and you're supposed to be hiding

7339
06:52:46,620 --> 06:52:47,820
you're supposed to be avoiding contact

7340
06:52:47,820 --> 06:52:50,400
I'm like hey I'm over here what you up

7341
06:52:50,400 --> 06:52:52,320
to it's like nothing much problem with

7342
06:52:52,320 --> 06:52:54,600
yourself you know it's like that one

7343
06:52:54,600 --> 06:52:56,940
machine that I did first wasn't even

7344
06:52:56,940 --> 06:52:58,798
plugged into a computer but I was

7345
06:52:58,798 --> 06:53:01,080
establishing a pattern so then I go to

7346
06:53:01,080 --> 06:53:03,360
her computer and I'm like yeah I'll do a

7347
06:53:03,360 --> 06:53:06,600
USB audit again

7348
06:53:06,600 --> 06:53:09,000
now this other lady she was working she

7349
06:53:09,000 --> 06:53:11,760
ain't having me okay so I do you know

7350
06:53:11,760 --> 06:53:14,400
classic bank robbery 101 I spin in the

7351
06:53:14,400 --> 06:53:16,620
chair uh until I can get a moment for

7352
06:53:16,620 --> 06:53:19,620
her to like you know let me uh Robert uh

7353
06:53:19,620 --> 06:53:21,000
she's still not happy with me but I'm

7354
06:53:21,000 --> 06:53:22,440
like hey I just want to do one day you

7355
06:53:22,440 --> 06:53:23,760
know you know compromise your system

7356
06:53:23,760 --> 06:53:26,400
thank you and so they won't take much

7357
06:53:26,400 --> 06:53:27,600
time

7358
06:53:27,600 --> 06:53:32,539
it's like see that was painless for me

7359
06:53:34,580 --> 06:53:37,680
smiling I'm smiling everybody's smiling

7360
06:53:37,680 --> 06:53:39,660
it's like I mean you don't have to be

7361
06:53:39,660 --> 06:53:42,120
mean to rob people and then the lady

7362
06:53:42,120 --> 06:53:43,740
that was on the phone I go and robbed

7363
06:53:43,740 --> 06:53:46,020
for as well uh just because you know

7364
06:53:46,020 --> 06:53:47,400
thorough

7365
06:53:47,400 --> 06:53:49,620
um and there we go what made that

7366
06:53:49,620 --> 06:53:51,540
possible

7367
06:53:51,540 --> 06:53:54,718
back column that is the only thing that

7368
06:53:54,718 --> 06:53:56,820
made that engagement possible right then

7369
06:53:56,820 --> 06:53:58,740
and there I would have to come in from a

7370
06:53:58,740 --> 06:54:00,780
totally different way or change my

7371
06:54:00,780 --> 06:54:03,000
perception and change my attack Vector

7372
06:54:03,000 --> 06:54:06,120
if that column wasn't there because when

7373
06:54:06,120 --> 06:54:09,900
I first walked in the teller saw me

7374
06:54:09,900 --> 06:54:11,638
and they knew I was coming from the

7375
06:54:11,638 --> 06:54:13,138
outside

7376
06:54:13,138 --> 06:54:16,440
they knew I was not trusted because they

7377
06:54:16,440 --> 06:54:17,878
don't know who I am they've never seen

7378
06:54:17,878 --> 06:54:19,860
me before and hopefully never see me

7379
06:54:19,860 --> 06:54:22,440
again it's like and they're like yeah

7380
06:54:22,440 --> 06:54:23,820
that's the one who's you know he

7381
06:54:23,820 --> 06:54:25,378
schedule yeah he doesn't supposed to be

7382
06:54:25,378 --> 06:54:28,020
here but when I went around that column

7383
06:54:28,020 --> 06:54:30,420
and I was there for a bit

7384
06:54:30,420 --> 06:54:32,760
they're not even thinking it consciously

7385
06:54:32,760 --> 06:54:34,620
but they're like oh you must be talking

7386
06:54:34,620 --> 06:54:36,600
to someone over there I don't see him

7387
06:54:36,600 --> 06:54:38,638
and then I'm coming from around the

7388
06:54:38,638 --> 06:54:41,520
column like I had talked to them and so

7389
06:54:41,520 --> 06:54:42,958
they're assuming oh he's from the

7390
06:54:42,958 --> 06:54:45,420
private side now he's been vetted it's

7391
06:54:45,420 --> 06:54:47,040
totally cool

7392
06:54:47,040 --> 06:54:49,378
and that it was just that simple and we

7393
06:54:49,378 --> 06:54:50,940
don't see that's one of the things I

7394
06:54:50,940 --> 06:54:52,260
love about being on spectrum is like

7395
06:54:52,260 --> 06:54:53,760
when especially says I was young I've

7396
06:54:53,760 --> 06:54:55,680
had to study human nature because normal

7397
06:54:55,680 --> 06:54:58,680
people scare them out of me okay and so

7398
06:54:58,680 --> 06:55:00,600
I had to learn what people look like and

7399
06:55:00,600 --> 06:55:02,520
how what they were thinking and how they

7400
06:55:02,520 --> 06:55:05,458
do shut up and stuff so I can mimic that

7401
06:55:05,458 --> 06:55:07,200
and so I could like be that way so I

7402
06:55:07,200 --> 06:55:09,420
wouldn't be you know too scary it's like

7403
06:55:09,420 --> 06:55:12,120
that's the whole point is being able to

7404
06:55:12,120 --> 06:55:13,920
look at Human Nature the stuff that they

7405
06:55:13,920 --> 06:55:16,860
don't even realize people do it's like

7406
06:55:16,860 --> 06:55:18,478
and trying to make sure that I can

7407
06:55:18,478 --> 06:55:20,280
capitalize off of it and problem with it

7408
06:55:20,280 --> 06:55:22,500
because fun

7409
06:55:22,500 --> 06:55:24,900
so after all that we can't all assume

7410
06:55:24,900 --> 06:55:27,478
that your company I said this all

7411
06:55:27,478 --> 06:55:28,978
funnily and stuff you know it's like

7412
06:55:28,978 --> 06:55:30,600
this fun ways of word look at don't look

7413
06:55:30,600 --> 06:55:33,958
it up it's like it's but seriously

7414
06:55:33,958 --> 06:55:36,660
I have had a 100 success rate on every

7415
06:55:36,660 --> 06:55:38,580
engagement I've been in the last decade

7416
06:55:38,580 --> 06:55:40,740
don't think that these people are stupid

7417
06:55:40,740 --> 06:55:42,298
don't think that these people did

7418
06:55:42,298 --> 06:55:44,100
something wrong

7419
06:55:44,100 --> 06:55:45,840
they didn't know and they weren't

7420
06:55:45,840 --> 06:55:47,520
trained and that's what I was there for

7421
06:55:47,520 --> 06:55:49,798
I wasn't there to test their security I

7422
06:55:49,798 --> 06:55:51,120
was there to teach them what an actual

7423
06:55:51,120 --> 06:55:53,160
attack looks like so their understanding

7424
06:55:53,160 --> 06:55:57,240
of it so yes that was fun to watch but

7425
06:55:57,240 --> 06:55:58,978
trust me that could be anybody's company

7426
06:55:58,978 --> 06:56:01,378
it's like they did it some of those

7427
06:56:01,378 --> 06:56:04,020
people did a really amazing job it's

7428
06:56:04,020 --> 06:56:06,240
like but they make slight mistakes and

7429
06:56:06,240 --> 06:56:09,120
that was what I was there to show so

7430
06:56:09,120 --> 06:56:11,040
they could be educated next time it

7431
06:56:11,040 --> 06:56:13,558
wasn't to make fun of them

7432
06:56:13,558 --> 06:56:15,298
because I'm not attacking your network

7433
06:56:15,298 --> 06:56:17,340
with technology or o days again I'm

7434
06:56:17,340 --> 06:56:19,740
attacking your people using their

7435
06:56:19,740 --> 06:56:22,740
perceptions and expectations to get in

7436
06:56:22,740 --> 06:56:25,500
that's all what that's all most of my

7437
06:56:25,500 --> 06:56:28,500
job is is trying to figure out how I can

7438
06:56:28,500 --> 06:56:29,878
blend in

7439
06:56:29,878 --> 06:56:32,878
and look like I belonged there when I

7440
06:56:32,878 --> 06:56:34,680
totally don't belong there

7441
06:56:34,680 --> 06:56:37,680
is a great example of that these two

7442
06:56:37,680 --> 06:56:41,280
pictures were taken 24 hours apart

7443
06:56:41,280 --> 06:56:43,500
they're a little bit different not too

7444
06:56:43,500 --> 06:56:45,420
different but they're a little bit

7445
06:56:45,420 --> 06:56:46,740
different

7446
06:56:46,740 --> 06:56:51,180
but what is the big difference in this

7447
06:56:51,180 --> 06:56:54,780
I don't have a jacket on

7448
06:56:54,780 --> 06:56:57,780
look at there's snow behind me I'm from

7449
06:56:57,780 --> 06:57:00,120
Texas I am freezing my

7450
06:57:00,120 --> 06:57:03,780
everything off right it is effing cold

7451
06:57:03,780 --> 06:57:05,280
outside

7452
06:57:05,280 --> 06:57:08,580
what kind of crazy person doesn't have a

7453
06:57:08,580 --> 06:57:10,920
jacket on when they have to walk Three

7454
06:57:10,920 --> 06:57:12,900
City Blocks to the place you're supposed

7455
06:57:12,900 --> 06:57:14,400
to compromise

7456
06:57:14,400 --> 06:57:16,558
well this kind of crazy person

7457
06:57:16,558 --> 06:57:20,298
because you know why once I break in

7458
06:57:20,298 --> 06:57:24,298
which spoiler alert I did it's like I'm

7459
06:57:24,298 --> 06:57:27,718
now walking inside the private area

7460
06:57:27,718 --> 06:57:30,058
without a jacket

7461
06:57:30,058 --> 06:57:32,100
so what does that mean

7462
06:57:32,100 --> 06:57:34,020
that means I must have already been

7463
06:57:34,020 --> 06:57:35,940
there and I already put my jacket

7464
06:57:35,940 --> 06:57:38,160
somewhere because if I would have shown

7465
06:57:38,160 --> 06:57:40,138
up in the parka that I would like to

7466
06:57:40,138 --> 06:57:41,400
have worn

7467
06:57:41,400 --> 06:57:43,080
that would be really weird coming to

7468
06:57:43,080 --> 06:57:44,940
your desk and I'm with I.T help desk

7469
06:57:44,940 --> 06:57:46,500
like why do you still have your jacket

7470
06:57:46,500 --> 06:57:47,520
on

7471
06:57:47,520 --> 06:57:49,378
it's like you know it's worm in here

7472
06:57:49,378 --> 06:57:52,440
that would be odd but since I didn't

7473
06:57:52,440 --> 06:57:54,058
have a jacket

7474
06:57:54,058 --> 06:57:56,820
without them even thinking about it

7475
06:57:56,820 --> 06:58:00,180
I'm assumed to be safe because obviously

7476
06:58:00,180 --> 06:58:02,340
I put my jacket in my conference room or

7477
06:58:02,340 --> 06:58:04,620
in my office obviously I've been there

7478
06:58:04,620 --> 06:58:06,780
for a while or I can have a jacket on if

7479
06:58:06,780 --> 06:58:08,580
I was coming from the outside so

7480
06:58:08,580 --> 06:58:11,100
therefore I must be from the inside

7481
06:58:11,100 --> 06:58:13,200
it's those simple things that we don't

7482
06:58:13,200 --> 06:58:15,840
think about that I'm trying to attack

7483
06:58:15,840 --> 06:58:17,400
and take advantage of

7484
06:58:17,400 --> 06:58:19,260
and I use it through my what I like to

7485
06:58:19,260 --> 06:58:20,940
call attacker fashion

7486
06:58:20,940 --> 06:58:22,798
I usually there's only three ways that

7487
06:58:22,798 --> 06:58:25,680
I'll rob you okay it's like I use my

7488
06:58:25,680 --> 06:58:29,218
assertive role my passive role and my

7489
06:58:29,218 --> 06:58:31,558
what the YOLO let's see if this works

7490
06:58:31,558 --> 06:58:34,860
well it's like uh we'll get all of them

7491
06:58:34,860 --> 06:58:36,240
um because in each one of those pictures

7492
06:58:36,240 --> 06:58:39,600
I was robbing people it's like and I

7493
06:58:39,600 --> 06:58:40,378
don't want anybody to think of

7494
06:58:40,378 --> 06:58:41,878
appropriation because I'm acting like

7495
06:58:41,878 --> 06:58:43,080
I'm a homeless person I used to live

7496
06:58:43,080 --> 06:58:44,280
behind a dumpster and I used to be

7497
06:58:44,280 --> 06:58:45,718
homeless when I was a teenager so it's

7498
06:58:45,718 --> 06:58:47,940
like I'm actually that was I was never

7499
06:58:47,940 --> 06:58:49,620
that fancy though and dressed that nice

7500
06:58:49,620 --> 06:58:53,638
uh or smell that good uh but I'm using

7501
06:58:53,638 --> 06:58:56,760
it to hack you because trust me no one

7502
06:58:56,760 --> 06:58:59,100
looks at a homeless person no one pays

7503
06:58:59,100 --> 06:59:01,320
attention to what's going on and and who

7504
06:59:01,320 --> 06:59:03,900
would have cardboard used to you know

7505
06:59:03,900 --> 06:59:06,420
take a computer to to attack people as

7506
06:59:06,420 --> 06:59:09,138
they're walking by

7507
06:59:09,420 --> 06:59:12,660
okay so we're going to start off with

7508
06:59:12,660 --> 06:59:14,340
the assertive role it doesn't mean

7509
06:59:14,340 --> 06:59:16,320
aggressive mostly sometimes I've been

7510
06:59:16,320 --> 06:59:18,000
sort of aggressive but it was like in

7511
06:59:18,000 --> 06:59:19,440
the first one where I was being very

7512
06:59:19,440 --> 06:59:20,820
certain way hey I'm supposed to be here

7513
06:59:20,820 --> 06:59:23,340
you need to contact management I'm close

7514
06:59:23,340 --> 06:59:24,660
to here you should have already talked

7515
06:59:24,660 --> 06:59:27,958
to headquarters the mannerisms are I'm

7516
06:59:27,958 --> 06:59:30,660
official I may be a little off-putting I

7517
06:59:30,660 --> 06:59:33,180
may be a little upset I may have jet lag

7518
06:59:33,180 --> 06:59:35,638
always when my children's having a

7519
06:59:35,638 --> 06:59:37,500
birthday it's like that I'm missing

7520
06:59:37,500 --> 06:59:39,240
because I had to fly over here and had

7521
06:59:39,240 --> 06:59:41,940
to do this audit so I'm just really you

7522
06:59:41,940 --> 06:59:44,520
know taxed uh and the hardware though is

7523
06:59:44,520 --> 06:59:46,320
way more limited I'm only using like a

7524
06:59:46,320 --> 06:59:48,420
small USB drive or I'm using some kind

7525
06:59:48,420 --> 06:59:50,400
of small device because I don't I want

7526
06:59:50,400 --> 06:59:52,080
to fit in with the suit that I'm wearing

7527
06:59:52,080 --> 06:59:53,280
usually

7528
06:59:53,280 --> 06:59:55,820
um but the suit that I'm wearing mother

7529
06:59:55,820 --> 06:59:59,580
nice okay this is the business you can

7530
06:59:59,580 --> 07:00:03,540
do okay it's like fear it and tremble uh

7531
07:00:03,540 --> 07:00:05,580
I had I used when I was allowed to go to

7532
07:00:05,580 --> 07:00:08,340
China a long story uh one of the best

7533
07:00:08,340 --> 07:00:11,878
things about it was us I had a tailor in

7534
07:00:11,878 --> 07:00:14,760
me she didn't Peter amazing amazing man

7535
07:00:14,760 --> 07:00:16,620
it's like you made all my shoes and

7536
07:00:16,620 --> 07:00:18,840
shirts and I love it when I was first

7537
07:00:18,840 --> 07:00:20,940
talking to him about my suit

7538
07:00:20,940 --> 07:00:22,860
because when I was talking about what I

7539
07:00:22,860 --> 07:00:25,798
wanted to design he says like are you a

7540
07:00:25,798 --> 07:00:30,058
magician and I'm like no Peter I'm not a

7541
07:00:30,058 --> 07:00:32,160
magician you know why you can tell

7542
07:00:32,160 --> 07:00:35,700
because Peter magicians always say look

7543
07:00:35,700 --> 07:00:38,878
nothing up my sleeve and Peter didn't I

7544
07:00:38,878 --> 07:00:40,920
specifically tell you to put pockets in

7545
07:00:40,920 --> 07:00:42,260
my sleeves

7546
07:00:42,260 --> 07:00:45,000
so I could put bash bunnies in there

7547
07:00:45,000 --> 07:00:47,700
it's like you're asking Jason why do you

7548
07:00:47,700 --> 07:00:49,558
think bachelor's your shoes because it's

7549
07:00:49,558 --> 07:00:53,218
cool period that's it now I just wanted

7550
07:00:53,218 --> 07:00:54,420
to be able to show that I had something

7551
07:00:54,420 --> 07:00:57,780
up my sleeve that's I'm 12. okay so

7552
07:00:57,780 --> 07:01:01,860
that's what I had that for and then also

7553
07:01:01,860 --> 07:01:04,020
I like to dress fancy in this sort of

7554
07:01:04,020 --> 07:01:06,058
world you know it's like my poor

7555
07:01:06,058 --> 07:01:07,680
background so I'm always trying to fancy

7556
07:01:07,680 --> 07:01:10,378
right it's like look at that can you see

7557
07:01:10,378 --> 07:01:11,940
the three hacking devices that are in

7558
07:01:11,940 --> 07:01:14,239
this picture

7559
07:01:14,580 --> 07:01:16,860
I mean come on USB recorder kit is

7560
07:01:16,860 --> 07:01:18,298
pretty obvious

7561
07:01:18,298 --> 07:01:21,240
that watch believe it or not it's not a

7562
07:01:21,240 --> 07:01:23,458
Rolex okay it's like I know you think

7563
07:01:23,458 --> 07:01:26,520
I'm balling like that but no uh that's a

7564
07:01:26,520 --> 07:01:28,620
16 gig USB hard drive that you can

7565
07:01:28,620 --> 07:01:30,660
connect to a cable down to 16 gigs a day

7566
07:01:30,660 --> 07:01:32,100
which I'm sure wouldn't affect anybody's

7567
07:01:32,100 --> 07:01:34,320
you know productivity uh and it's going

7568
07:01:34,320 --> 07:01:36,958
to also hide that video camera in it uh

7569
07:01:36,958 --> 07:01:39,958
so that's nice but the best one

7570
07:01:39,958 --> 07:01:43,740
is Peter also made all my shirts

7571
07:01:43,740 --> 07:01:46,620
and he made them all French stuff and it

7572
07:01:46,620 --> 07:01:48,478
was like you want these offers I was

7573
07:01:48,478 --> 07:01:51,958
like yes Peter I want to be fancy okay

7574
07:01:51,958 --> 07:01:54,120
because I always thought wearing

7575
07:01:54,120 --> 07:01:57,180
cufflinks make you fancy and they do I'm

7576
07:01:57,180 --> 07:01:58,860
pretty classy AF and stuff you know when

7577
07:01:58,860 --> 07:02:00,900
I'm wearing my my first cup shirts with

7578
07:02:00,900 --> 07:02:02,940
my cool cufflinks but these couplings

7579
07:02:02,940 --> 07:02:05,400
are the coolest since I can use them to

7580
07:02:05,400 --> 07:02:07,020
rob you with

7581
07:02:07,020 --> 07:02:09,120
because one of those is a wireless

7582
07:02:09,120 --> 07:02:11,638
adapter that I plug into your server or

7583
07:02:11,638 --> 07:02:14,400
CEO's desktop it's like it turned into a

7584
07:02:14,400 --> 07:02:16,260
wireless access point and don't worry if

7585
07:02:16,260 --> 07:02:18,360
you're using Mac or Windows or Linux and

7586
07:02:18,360 --> 07:02:21,000
stuff uh the other cup link has a two

7587
07:02:21,000 --> 07:02:22,500
gig USB drive with all the wireless

7588
07:02:22,500 --> 07:02:24,718
drivers uh that I can get into install

7589
07:02:24,718 --> 07:02:27,180
and it may be a couple of commanding and

7590
07:02:27,180 --> 07:02:29,400
control payloads and some GIFs that I'll

7591
07:02:29,400 --> 07:02:31,620
leave on the server uh for myself to use

7592
07:02:31,620 --> 07:02:33,780
as I'm then hacking you the rest of the

7593
07:02:33,780 --> 07:02:36,120
time from the parking lot of my new

7594
07:02:36,120 --> 07:02:38,878
access point into your internal Network

7595
07:02:38,878 --> 07:02:40,740
so

7596
07:02:40,740 --> 07:02:44,040
fancy AF right uh here's some other

7597
07:02:44,040 --> 07:02:46,320
devices and it's like my jackets you can

7598
07:02:46,320 --> 07:02:48,840
tell it has sorry things but it's got

7599
07:02:48,840 --> 07:02:49,920
pockets

7600
07:02:49,920 --> 07:02:52,740
right is that amazing look at all those

7601
07:02:52,740 --> 07:02:55,080
Pockets hey trust me I'm right there

7602
07:02:55,080 --> 07:02:56,820
with you I don't know what is wrong with

7603
07:02:56,820 --> 07:02:58,320
the Western culture that women can have

7604
07:02:58,320 --> 07:03:00,780
pockets and men can't wear purses I love

7605
07:03:00,780 --> 07:03:02,520
having purses and like little backpacks

7606
07:03:02,520 --> 07:03:04,378
so we got to call them tactical bags now

7607
07:03:04,378 --> 07:03:06,000
because it makes it sound more manly for

7608
07:03:06,000 --> 07:03:09,058
us we love wearing purses too okay uh so

7609
07:03:09,058 --> 07:03:12,000
uh you see all those devices

7610
07:03:12,000 --> 07:03:14,280
that's how many devices in that lineup

7611
07:03:14,280 --> 07:03:16,260
that I've used

7612
07:03:16,260 --> 07:03:19,558
four maybe five but it looks cool don't

7613
07:03:19,558 --> 07:03:21,660
it you ever seen those movies works out

7614
07:03:21,660 --> 07:03:23,400
the Assassins or the spies and they

7615
07:03:23,400 --> 07:03:25,500
reveal that hidden wall a picture and

7616
07:03:25,500 --> 07:03:27,420
it's got all those lines of guns and

7617
07:03:27,420 --> 07:03:30,420
Bazookas and they go like here

7618

07:05:21,540 --> 07:05:22,260
again

7668
07:05:22,260 --> 07:05:24,718

um

7675
07:05:37,860 --> 07:05:40,080
but we're still getting the computers

7676
07:05:40,080 --> 07:05:42,180

7678
07:05:44,040 --> 07:05:47,780
no all right

7679
07:05:48,840 --> 07:05:51,000
bird

7680
07:05:51,000 --> 07:05:53,100
it's like I mean I brought people in a

7681
07:05:53,100 --> 07:05:54,780
wheelchair before it's like I'm a bad

7682
07:05:54,780 --> 07:05:57,240
person when I'm hey remember the kittens

7683
07:05:57,240 --> 07:05:59,420
okay

7684
07:05:59,420 --> 07:06:02,218
established my moral fiber as someone

7685
07:06:02,218 --> 07:06:06,058
who is trying to rob you okay I don't

7686
07:06:06,058 --> 07:06:07,740
know why people get upset about what

7687
07:06:07,740 --> 07:06:10,378
level people are robbing people with

7688
07:06:10,378 --> 07:06:12,120

little bit higher it's like so that's

7691
07:06:17,160 --> 07:06:19,620
what I try to and detect the gear that I

7692
07:06:19,620 --> 07:06:21,840
use is much more diverse because you

7693
07:06:21,840 --> 07:06:23,400
know people are you and I've literally

7694

7695

07:07:12,660 --> 07:07:14,878
got a copy of it but it's not as fun as

7719
07:07:14,878 --> 07:07:16,378
using the old one and still getting away

7720
07:07:16,378 --> 07:07:20,580

12. and here is the clipboard to do

7722

7723
07:07:27,660 --> 07:07:29,040
clipboard to Doom

7724
07:07:29,040 --> 07:07:31,020

7728
07:07:36,540 --> 07:07:38,218
questioned me because I like to come

7729
07:07:38,218 --> 07:07:40,500
with warning labels but here

7730
07:07:40,500 --> 07:07:43,860
is one of the other scariest tools that

7731
07:07:43,860 --> 07:07:46,378
I've used on my engagements and I'm not

7732
07:07:46,378 --> 07:07:48,240
talking about those two awesome OMG

7733
07:07:48,240 --> 07:07:50,700
cables that are microcomputers disguised

7734
07:07:50,700 --> 07:07:53,100
as charging cables which are really

7735
07:07:53,100 --> 07:07:55,500
really good at robbing people with no

7736
07:07:55,500 --> 07:07:57,360
I'm talking about the even more

7737
07:07:57,360 --> 07:07:59,458
intimidating one

7738
07:07:59,458 --> 07:08:01,138
the envelopes

7739
07:08:01,138 --> 07:08:03,478
with the red marker

7740
07:08:03,478 --> 07:08:07,020
there is nothing more effective to

7741
07:08:07,020 --> 07:08:08,820
compromise a company

7742
07:08:08,820 --> 07:08:10,978
then walking through a

7743
07:08:10,978 --> 07:08:15,420
secure area Okay seeing someone's office

7744
07:08:15,420 --> 07:08:17,100
or cubicle

7745
07:08:17,100 --> 07:08:18,540
empty

7746
07:08:18,540 --> 07:08:21,180
we can see their name on their little

7747
07:08:21,180 --> 07:08:23,760
badge inside their door so you walk on

7748
07:08:23,760 --> 07:08:24,900
in

7749
07:08:24,900 --> 07:08:27,840
grab a delicious USB drive

7750
07:08:27,840 --> 07:08:30,420
put it in the envelope

7751
07:08:30,420 --> 07:08:33,000
you know still look nice and tight write

7752
07:08:33,000 --> 07:08:34,860
your name on it

7753
07:08:34,860 --> 07:08:38,660
leave it on your desk and walk away

7754
07:08:38,660 --> 07:08:42,120
who is not going to their desk seeing an

7755
07:08:42,120 --> 07:08:44,340
envelope with their name on it

7756
07:08:44,340 --> 07:08:48,120
and a USB drive on inside vehicle and

7757
07:08:48,120 --> 07:08:51,378
not plugging that into their computer

7758
07:08:51,718 --> 07:08:54,360
horrible I know it's like I thought of

7759
07:08:54,360 --> 07:08:56,458
it myself I'm so proud it's like it's

7760
07:08:56,458 --> 07:08:59,100
diabolical uh kittens

7761
07:08:59,100 --> 07:09:01,320
um some of the other devices I'm using

7762
07:09:01,320 --> 07:09:03,718
is like you know the Wi-Fi pineapple I

7763
07:09:03,718 --> 07:09:05,100
got the proximate card that I've never

7764
07:09:05,100 --> 07:09:06,540
used let's be honest it's like I don't

7765
07:09:06,540 --> 07:09:08,878
use I don't clone cards it's like it's

7766
07:09:08,878 --> 07:09:11,400
cool and all the cool guys that can do

7767
07:09:11,400 --> 07:09:13,378
all the really cool you know cloning and

7768
07:09:13,378 --> 07:09:16,020
it's like it's like more power to you

7769
07:09:16,020 --> 07:09:17,520
but it's like I just never needed it

7770
07:09:17,520 --> 07:09:19,020
it's like I'm sure eventually when I get

7771
07:09:19,020 --> 07:09:20,458
to a point where I have to actually you

7772
07:09:20,458 --> 07:09:22,200
know adult for a living it's like I

7773
07:09:22,200 --> 07:09:24,420
might do that but I doubt it uh and then

7774
07:09:24,420 --> 07:09:25,860
just some of the other tools that I

7775
07:09:25,860 --> 07:09:27,420
might use in there one of the things I

7776
07:09:27,420 --> 07:09:29,340
like is when it says pumped on it is or

7777
07:09:29,340 --> 07:09:30,780
hacked it's like that is a screen craft

7778
07:09:30,780 --> 07:09:33,780
it's like you plug that in to the HDMI

7779
07:09:33,780 --> 07:09:36,360
uh usually the executives because you

7780
07:09:36,360 --> 07:09:39,058
know you're still using CRT or DVI or

7781
07:09:39,058 --> 07:09:40,440
something right it's like but the

7782
07:09:40,440 --> 07:09:42,780
executives they got the HDMI monitors

7783
07:09:42,780 --> 07:09:45,240
but because they classic right it's like

7784
07:09:45,240 --> 07:09:48,120
so you plug that in one end goes into

7785
07:09:48,120 --> 07:09:49,978
the monitor the other end goes into the

7786
07:09:49,978 --> 07:09:51,600
computer it's like from both into that

7787
07:09:51,600 --> 07:09:54,780
device and what does that do oh it

7788
07:09:54,780 --> 07:09:58,978
records everything it sees on the screen

7789
07:09:58,978 --> 07:10:01,080
your CEOs I'm sure are not looking at

7790
07:10:01,080 --> 07:10:02,760
any kind of emails that may be sensitive

7791
07:10:02,760 --> 07:10:04,620
or information that they may not want

7792
07:10:04,620 --> 07:10:06,958
the public to see because it's being

7793
07:10:06,958 --> 07:10:09,780
broadcasted wirelessly to my computer is

7794
07:10:09,780 --> 07:10:11,520
like uh am I bring it in the parking lot

7795
07:10:11,520 --> 07:10:14,218
maybe not a man because that's like it's

7796
07:10:14,218 --> 07:10:16,020
scary it's like but you know my Honda

7797
07:10:16,020 --> 07:10:18,478
Civic it's like in the parking lot I'm

7798
07:10:18,478 --> 07:10:21,540
on a budget it's like so now the next

7799
07:10:21,540 --> 07:10:24,420
one and I'm embarrassed about how many

7800
07:10:24,420 --> 07:10:26,580
times I've actually had to use this

7801
07:10:26,580 --> 07:10:30,298
um this should not be your first choice

7802
07:10:30,298 --> 07:10:33,540
but in certain situations I'm faced with

7803
07:10:33,540 --> 07:10:36,420
like I don't know what kind of detection

7804
07:10:36,420 --> 07:10:38,760
is going to get me into this place and

7805
07:10:38,760 --> 07:10:41,878
so I'm like yellow let's see if I can

7806
07:10:41,878 --> 07:10:44,878
fake being a TV producer and break it to

7807
07:10:44,878 --> 07:10:47,638
a financial place in Jamaica spoiler

7808
07:10:47,638 --> 07:10:50,458
alert the answer is yes it's like or

7809
07:10:50,458 --> 07:10:53,218
break into a hotel as a drunk customer

7810
07:10:53,218 --> 07:10:55,378
who's Barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja

7811
07:10:55,378 --> 07:10:58,138
Turtle pajama bottoms uh in the south of

7812
07:10:58,138 --> 07:11:01,260
France spoiled alert that's me after I

7813
07:11:01,260 --> 07:11:04,620
broke into a glacial hotel in the south

7814
07:11:04,620 --> 07:11:06,718
of France Barefoot and teenage turtle

7815
07:11:06,718 --> 07:11:08,218
pajama bottles

7816
07:11:08,218 --> 07:11:10,378
the best part about it is that picture

7817
07:11:10,378 --> 07:11:12,240
that you're seeing on the right that's

7818
07:11:12,240 --> 07:11:14,760
not from the hotel I robbed that's the

7819
07:11:14,760 --> 07:11:16,500
dump they put me in because they

7820
07:11:16,500 --> 07:11:18,600
couldn't afford to keep me in their

7821
07:11:18,600 --> 07:11:21,660
hotel for the whole engagement

7822
07:11:21,660 --> 07:11:24,240
they can only afford in the off-season

7823
07:11:24,240 --> 07:11:27,120
for me to be there for one night to do

7824
07:11:27,120 --> 07:11:29,280
the physical part of the engagement

7825
07:11:29,280 --> 07:11:32,400
that's how expensive it was it's like it

7826
07:11:32,400 --> 07:11:33,958
was very exclusive and it wasn't in

7827
07:11:33,958 --> 07:11:35,160
common

7828
07:11:35,160 --> 07:11:37,378
you know or you know we're like the the

7829
07:11:37,378 --> 07:11:39,958
the the Newbie rich people go it was

7830
07:11:39,958 --> 07:11:41,820
like in jean-top ferrat where like you

7831
07:11:41,820 --> 07:11:43,500
know you don't know about because that's

7832
07:11:43,500 --> 07:11:45,180
where like the people have boats under

7833
07:11:45,180 --> 07:11:47,940
boats with a helicopter right it's like

7834
07:11:47,940 --> 07:11:49,860
that's the fun stuff

7835
07:11:49,860 --> 07:11:52,260
um that's to dump the movie in if it was

7836
07:11:52,260 --> 07:11:55,378
amazing time it's like hey

7837
07:11:55,378 --> 07:11:56,100
um

7838
07:11:56,100 --> 07:11:59,040
and I'm only using you know like a small

7839
07:11:59,040 --> 07:12:00,900
Rubber Ducky on that it's like I'm using

7840
07:12:00,900 --> 07:12:02,940
like the pen video thing it's like

7841
07:12:02,940 --> 07:12:04,860
because of the fact that it's like I I

7842
07:12:04,860 --> 07:12:06,780
don't know what the situation is going

7843
07:12:06,780 --> 07:12:08,580
to make it I've gone in as a tourist

7844
07:12:08,580 --> 07:12:10,860
it's like when you're it when you're

7845
07:12:10,860 --> 07:12:12,660
definitely going somewhere especially in

7846
07:12:12,660 --> 07:12:15,298
Asia it's like when I broke into places

7847
07:12:15,298 --> 07:12:18,660
like that it shame is a very big thing

7848
07:12:18,660 --> 07:12:20,580
that you should never manipulate people

7849
07:12:20,580 --> 07:12:24,540
with but on their part but yes I have

7850
07:12:24,540 --> 07:12:27,298
acted like I peed my pants and and went

7851
07:12:27,298 --> 07:12:29,820
to a security guard and was like I had

7852
07:12:29,820 --> 07:12:31,260
an accident

7853
07:12:31,260 --> 07:12:35,040
okay and he immediately let me into the

7854
07:12:35,040 --> 07:12:36,240
private area so I could get in the

7855
07:12:36,240 --> 07:12:38,400
restroom and save fakes and stuff you

7856
07:12:38,400 --> 07:12:40,080
know I was very thoughtful for that uh

7857
07:12:40,080 --> 07:12:41,580
he was not thoughtful after he realized

7858
07:12:41,580 --> 07:12:42,958
all the other stuff that I did once he

7859
07:12:42,958 --> 07:12:45,660
left me unattended uh but still

7860
07:12:45,660 --> 07:12:49,620
yes it's crazy but is it really crazy if

7861
07:12:49,620 --> 07:12:51,058
it works

7862
07:12:51,058 --> 07:12:53,700
yes but it worked

7863
07:12:53,700 --> 07:12:56,340
uh and so just remember it's like if you

7864
07:12:56,340 --> 07:12:58,320
do find a way in if I do find a way in

7865
07:12:58,320 --> 07:13:01,320
and trust me I usually do I love the

7866
07:13:01,320 --> 07:13:02,458
picture on the right it's my favorite

7867
07:13:02,458 --> 07:13:03,780
because I can't do this stuff anymore

7868
07:13:03,780 --> 07:13:05,878
but that's me climbing seven stories

7869
07:13:05,878 --> 07:13:08,218
above the Cozy Cypress uh coming out of

7870
07:13:08,218 --> 07:13:10,138
a window that was like a straight drop

7871
07:13:10,138 --> 07:13:12,840
down going around to an Arabic that was

7872
07:13:12,840 --> 07:13:14,100
going this way when it should have gone

7873
07:13:14,100 --> 07:13:16,378
this way and climbing up over it and

7874
07:13:16,378 --> 07:13:18,420
bypassing all the surveillance cameras

7875
07:13:18,420 --> 07:13:19,740
to show that I could get into their

7876
07:13:19,740 --> 07:13:21,540
server room on the roof because they

7877
07:13:21,540 --> 07:13:22,978
they didn't think anybody would get in

7878
07:13:22,978 --> 07:13:24,900
from that way and so that's why they had

7879
07:13:24,900 --> 07:13:26,458
glass windows would just you know

7880
07:13:26,458 --> 07:13:30,058
drywall protecting it uh and when I got

7881
07:13:30,058 --> 07:13:31,740
to the top I mean the guys who said I

7882
07:13:31,740 --> 07:13:33,360
couldn't do it who was holding my jacket

7883
07:13:33,360 --> 07:13:35,040
taking the picture

7884
07:13:35,040 --> 07:13:38,878
um but yeah I will find a way in

7885
07:13:38,878 --> 07:13:41,340
so make sure your employees know how to

7886
07:13:41,340 --> 07:13:45,478
respond once I'm there now let's end it

7887
07:13:45,478 --> 07:13:48,360
with the final myth and one of the

7888
07:13:48,360 --> 07:13:50,820
biggest myths

7889
07:13:50,820 --> 07:13:53,458
security awareness in its current form

7890
07:13:53,458 --> 07:13:55,920
is working

7891
07:13:55,920 --> 07:13:58,860
total total

7892
07:13:58,860 --> 07:14:00,900
BS

7893
07:14:00,900 --> 07:14:05,458
you know why we suck at doing security

7894
07:14:05,458 --> 07:14:08,100
awareness

7895
07:14:08,100 --> 07:14:13,138
why are we trying to teach our users all

7896
07:14:13,138 --> 07:14:15,058
these little nice one little things so

7897
07:14:15,058 --> 07:14:17,638
they can do their internet web only you

7898
07:14:17,638 --> 07:14:20,340
know 10 question thing every six months

7899
07:14:20,340 --> 07:14:23,718
and multiple choice and go

7900
07:14:23,718 --> 07:14:25,680
compliance

7901
07:14:25,680 --> 07:14:28,080
but that's not working

7902
07:14:28,080 --> 07:14:32,340
how many people in your company realize

7903
07:14:32,340 --> 07:14:34,820
that one of their job responsibilities

7904
07:14:34,820 --> 07:14:38,100
is to protect the equipment that they

7905
07:14:38,100 --> 07:14:40,500
are given

7906
07:14:40,500 --> 07:14:42,840
oh I've never heard it said like that

7907
07:14:42,840 --> 07:14:45,360
Jason yes shut up

7908
07:14:45,360 --> 07:14:48,000
because that's what it is an employee

7909
07:14:48,000 --> 07:14:51,660
will do everything that is required for

7910
07:14:51,660 --> 07:14:54,840
them to stay employed and successfully

7911
07:14:54,840 --> 07:14:57,298
feed and clothe themselves and their

7912
07:14:57,298 --> 07:15:00,958
their partners and their family

7913
07:15:00,958 --> 07:15:04,320
not an Iota less

7914
07:15:04,320 --> 07:15:07,260
or more more it's like we do a lot less

7915
07:15:07,260 --> 07:15:10,920
it's like not an Iota more okay

7916
07:15:10,920 --> 07:15:13,378
and that's the problem information

7917
07:15:13,378 --> 07:15:18,058
security is making security like it's an

7918
07:15:18,058 --> 07:15:19,558
add-on

7919
07:15:19,558 --> 07:15:21,058
like it's something that's an

7920
07:15:21,058 --> 07:15:22,558
afterthought or something that they

7921
07:15:22,558 --> 07:15:24,958
don't really have to worry about

7922
07:15:24,958 --> 07:15:28,138
if you have a company that uses an

7923
07:15:28,138 --> 07:15:30,660
employee's delivery drivers

7924
07:15:30,660 --> 07:15:33,120
on the first day of their job you give

7925
07:15:33,120 --> 07:15:35,400
them the car keys and go

7926
07:15:35,400 --> 07:15:37,020
we hired you you know what you're doing

7927
07:15:37,020 --> 07:15:39,958
here's the keys have fun here's your

7928
07:15:39,958 --> 07:15:40,680
route

7929
07:15:40,680 --> 07:15:42,420
no

7930
07:15:42,420 --> 07:15:44,638
mother think about a sixty thousand

7931
07:15:44,638 --> 07:15:46,978
dollar piece of equipment in their

7932
07:15:46,978 --> 07:15:50,458
control they've got liability to the

7933
07:15:50,458 --> 07:15:51,240
public

7934
07:15:51,240 --> 07:15:53,040
you're making sure they know that they

7935
07:15:53,040 --> 07:15:54,900
have to use the turn signals you're

7936
07:15:54,900 --> 07:15:56,280
making sure that they know that there's

7937
07:15:56,280 --> 07:15:58,080
a safety belt that has to be used at all

7938
07:15:58,080 --> 07:16:00,298
times but look you've got your number on

7939
07:16:00,298 --> 07:16:01,680
the back of the van knowing that they're

7940
07:16:01,680 --> 07:16:03,240
going to get knocked out as soon as they

7941
07:16:03,240 --> 07:16:06,000
make a wrong turn somewhere

7942
07:16:06,000 --> 07:16:08,400
you've got them understanding and if

7943
07:16:08,400 --> 07:16:10,860
they get in a traffic accident

7944
07:16:10,860 --> 07:16:13,440
it's like are they getting a slap on the

7945
07:16:13,440 --> 07:16:14,458
wrist

7946
07:16:14,458 --> 07:16:16,740
well that band is getting bumped out and

7947
07:16:16,740 --> 07:16:21,000
giving a new man oh no if they can break

7948
07:16:21,000 --> 07:16:23,940
that band three times and total it

7949
07:16:23,940 --> 07:16:27,240
are they still employed in your company

7950
07:16:27,240 --> 07:16:29,280
I doubt it

7951
07:16:29,280 --> 07:16:32,580
but we give our employees a piece of

7952
07:16:32,580 --> 07:16:33,718
equipment

7953
07:16:33,718 --> 07:16:37,020
and just go knock yourself out

7954
07:16:37,020 --> 07:16:38,940
they get to make a mistake on that

7955
07:16:38,940 --> 07:16:41,400
equipment and jeopardize the security of

7956
07:16:41,400 --> 07:16:43,080
the company like oh okay we're going to

7957
07:16:43,080 --> 07:16:44,878
restage this it's like you gotta don't

7958
07:16:44,878 --> 07:16:47,400
do this next time

7959
07:16:47,400 --> 07:16:50,040
if you're that worried about a sixty

7960
07:16:50,040 --> 07:16:52,200
thousand dollar piece of equipment

7961
07:16:52,200 --> 07:16:54,718
why aren't you worried about a person

7962
07:16:54,718 --> 07:16:57,958
clicking on an email and costing you 350

7963
07:16:57,958 --> 07:16:59,400
million dollars and looking at your

7964
07:16:59,400 --> 07:17:03,260
target it's like why not

7965
07:17:03,718 --> 07:17:07,080
that's costing you 300 150 million

7966
07:17:07,080 --> 07:17:10,860
dollars that's a lot of the things

7967
07:17:10,860 --> 07:17:13,378
like I'm not good at math but that's a

7968
07:17:13,378 --> 07:17:15,500
lot

7969
07:17:16,520 --> 07:17:18,600
yeah I'm not gonna do it it's like yeah

7970
07:17:18,600 --> 07:17:20,340
he's like but that's

7971
07:17:20,340 --> 07:17:22,200
the equipment

7972
07:17:22,200 --> 07:17:24,660
that laptop is an equipment that they're

7973
07:17:24,660 --> 07:17:27,058
responsible for securing that they're

7974
07:17:27,058 --> 07:17:29,040
responsible for taking care of it the

7975
07:17:29,040 --> 07:17:31,200
only problem is not that they don't want

7976
07:17:31,200 --> 07:17:33,718
to do it is that you haven't shown them

7977
07:17:33,718 --> 07:17:35,160
that that's one of their

7978
07:17:35,160 --> 07:17:38,000
responsibilities

7979
07:17:56,478 --> 07:17:59,820
if you start showing them from the first

7980
07:17:59,820 --> 07:18:01,378
day that they're employed that that's

7981
07:18:01,378 --> 07:18:03,478
part of their responsibilities they're

7982
07:18:03,478 --> 07:18:05,700
not gonna like it but they're going to

7983
07:18:05,700 --> 07:18:06,900
do it

7984
07:18:06,900 --> 07:18:09,000
just like they know not the coaching but

7985
07:18:09,000 --> 07:18:11,100
you know certain bad places on the

7986
07:18:11,100 --> 07:18:12,780
internet while they're on the company

7987
07:18:12,780 --> 07:18:15,780
equipment they'll know not to click on

7988
07:18:15,780 --> 07:18:18,240
suspicious links or go to unsuspecting

7989
07:18:18,240 --> 07:18:19,740
websites that they're not familiar with

7990
07:18:19,740 --> 07:18:21,900
because that's also the policy that's

7991
07:18:21,900 --> 07:18:24,840
also enforced because we need to educate

7992
07:18:24,840 --> 07:18:28,740
our employees not on the do's and don'ts

7993
07:18:28,740 --> 07:18:31,260
of spearfishing or surfing

7994
07:18:31,260 --> 07:18:34,378
we need to educate them on the fact that

7995
07:18:34,378 --> 07:18:37,020
one of their roles is that they're a

7996
07:18:37,020 --> 07:18:39,660
member of the security team they are

7997
07:18:39,660 --> 07:18:42,298
part of information security they're not

7998
07:18:42,298 --> 07:18:45,298
above it or beneath it or besides they

7999
07:18:45,298 --> 07:18:47,520
are a part of the team and you better

8000
07:18:47,520 --> 07:18:49,500
actually start treating them like your

8001
07:18:49,500 --> 07:18:51,718
party routine they are not a liability

8002
07:18:51,718 --> 07:18:54,718
they're the best human but here you're

8003
07:18:54,718 --> 07:18:56,280
going to go through another 30-minute

8004
07:18:56,280 --> 07:18:58,680
class on information security on the

8005
07:18:58,680 --> 07:19:00,298
policies and practices and how you can

8006
07:19:00,298 --> 07:19:02,878
be better aware of how these phishing

8007
07:19:02,878 --> 07:19:05,040
attacks happen and how to be more

8008
07:19:05,040 --> 07:19:06,718
cautious with them

8009
07:19:06,718 --> 07:19:09,780
they do it again for the second time

8010
07:19:09,780 --> 07:19:12,000
you're going

8011
07:19:12,000 --> 07:19:15,718
okay we're gonna write this one up

8012
07:19:15,718 --> 07:19:18,900
you're now in a separate group where all

8013
07:19:18,900 --> 07:19:21,240
your emails are being quarantined and

8014
07:19:21,240 --> 07:19:23,160
you have to whitelist all the emails you

8015
07:19:23,160 --> 07:19:26,458
want for the next six months so you can

8016
07:19:26,458 --> 07:19:29,160
understand what kind of emails are

8017
07:19:29,160 --> 07:19:31,020
coming into your environment and which

8018
07:19:31,020 --> 07:19:33,240
ones you need to be clear up

8019
07:19:33,240 --> 07:19:36,540
that sucks yeah so does losing 350

8020
07:19:36,540 --> 07:19:37,978
million dollars

8021
07:19:37,978 --> 07:19:41,820
okay on the third time

8022
07:19:41,820 --> 07:19:44,100
bye

8023
07:19:44,100 --> 07:19:47,160
see you later it's like I'm not going to

8024
07:19:47,160 --> 07:19:49,378
let because I'm not going to let you

8025
07:19:49,378 --> 07:19:52,020
consistently jeopardize my employment

8026
07:19:52,020 --> 07:19:54,000
and all your co-workers appointment

8027
07:19:54,000 --> 07:19:58,218
because you like to click willy-nilly

8028
07:19:58,320 --> 07:20:00,840
and also you need to interact with your

8029
07:20:00,840 --> 07:20:03,718
employees when things aren't on fire

8030
07:20:03,718 --> 07:20:05,878
when I used to work on a game task force

8031
07:20:05,878 --> 07:20:08,100
I met everybody on the worst possible

8032
07:20:08,100 --> 07:20:09,600
day of their life

8033
07:20:09,600 --> 07:20:11,940
something horrible happened to them and

8034
07:20:11,940 --> 07:20:13,080
I show up

8035
07:20:13,080 --> 07:20:15,660

8036
07:20:15,660 --> 07:20:17,940
happen to them it's always the worst

8037
07:20:17,940 --> 07:20:20,940
possible day it's like not much has

8038

they're part of the team and you're

8063

8070
07:21:31,440 --> 07:21:33,120
of the team it's like you need to

8071
07:21:33,120 --> 07:21:35,940
interact and be positive with them

8072
07:21:35,940 --> 07:21:38,359

8074
07:21:54,800 --> 07:21:57,939
[Applause]

8075
07:21:59,820 --> 07:22:02,218
around creating awareness of every

8076
07:22:02,218 --> 07:22:05,180
employee and wait hold on hold that guy

8077
07:22:05,180 --> 07:22:09,180
really loud okay

8078
07:22:09,180 --> 07:22:10,500
um right so

8079
07:22:10,500 --> 07:22:12,478
obviously you're trying to encourage

8080
07:22:12,478 --> 07:22:13,920
that every person has a sense of

8081
07:22:13,920 --> 07:22:15,718
awareness so that when everything feels

8082
07:22:15,718 --> 07:22:17,900
off

8083
07:22:19,340 --> 07:22:21,718
but a lot of the new approaches

8084
07:22:21,718 --> 07:22:24,840
completely up to Stage what things

8085
07:22:24,840 --> 07:22:27,360
should sell us all right companies are

8086
07:22:27,360 --> 07:22:29,218
using in tune they're pushing athletes

8087
07:22:29,218 --> 07:22:31,558
you all of the security things happen

8088
07:22:31,558 --> 07:22:33,780
behind a system that you have no

8089
07:22:33,780 --> 07:22:35,940
awareness of what do you think of that

8090
07:22:35,940 --> 07:22:37,680
is that is that good for us as a bad

8091
07:22:37,680 --> 07:22:39,660
what's the balance I think one of the

8092
07:22:39,660 --> 07:22:42,798
things is we need to learn how to

8093
07:22:42,798 --> 07:22:45,420
not talk

8094
07:22:45,420 --> 07:22:49,680
to users we're very good at explaining

8095
07:22:49,680 --> 07:22:53,160
to people very technical things and a

8096
07:22:53,160 --> 07:22:54,718
way more technical complicated thing

8097
07:22:54,718 --> 07:22:56,580
that is necessary

8098
07:22:56,580 --> 07:22:58,260
it's like you want to get someone

8099
07:22:58,260 --> 07:23:00,540
interested in how they need it why they

8100
07:23:00,540 --> 07:23:01,978
need to be uh secured with their

8101
07:23:01,978 --> 07:23:03,360
vehicles how many

8102
07:23:03,360 --> 07:23:05,760
here don't lock their cars because it's

8103
07:23:05,760 --> 07:23:10,019
such a safe neighborhood right exactly

8104
07:23:12,360 --> 07:23:15,540
and so you explain to them do you keep

8105
07:23:15,540 --> 07:23:17,160
your car unlocked when you go to the

8106
07:23:17,160 --> 07:23:18,298
grocery store because you're only going

8107
07:23:18,298 --> 07:23:21,000
to be there for five minutes no

8108
07:23:21,000 --> 07:23:24,298
so why do not lock your workstation when

8109
07:23:24,298 --> 07:23:26,580
you're going to be gone from it it's

8110
07:23:26,580 --> 07:23:29,458
like do you allow every person that

8111
07:23:29,458 --> 07:23:31,260
wants to stop you on the street and try

8112
07:23:31,260 --> 07:23:33,000
to sell you something or talk to you do

8113
07:23:33,000 --> 07:23:34,680
you engage with every single one of

8114
07:23:34,680 --> 07:23:35,878
those people

8115
07:23:35,878 --> 07:23:39,360
not hardly it's like so why are you

8116
07:23:39,360 --> 07:23:41,878
doing that when they send you emails

8117
07:23:41,878 --> 07:23:44,580
it's like equated the ways that they can

8118
07:23:44,580 --> 07:23:46,860
relate to and they can understand it's

8119
07:23:46,860 --> 07:23:51,420
not their job to understand you it is

8120
07:23:51,420 --> 07:23:55,020
your job to say it in ways that they can

8121
07:23:55,020 --> 07:23:57,058
understand and that they can be useful

8122
07:23:57,058 --> 07:24:00,660
it's like make you talking Tech and

8123
07:24:00,660 --> 07:24:03,020
talking you know really astounding smart

8124
07:24:03,020 --> 07:24:05,040
helps no one

8125
07:24:05,040 --> 07:24:07,920
if they can't get anything from it it's

8126
07:24:07,920 --> 07:24:09,540
like all you did was waste your time

8127
07:24:09,540 --> 07:24:12,058
it's like so we need to be able to

8128
07:24:12,058 --> 07:24:14,100
communicate with them and not just show

8129
07:24:14,100 --> 07:24:16,978
them like why it's technically sound we

8130
07:24:16,978 --> 07:24:19,740
show them hey this is why we're doing

8131
07:24:19,740 --> 07:24:21,180
this stuff because this is just basic

8132
07:24:21,180 --> 07:24:23,160
security you're not going to leave your

8133
07:24:23,160 --> 07:24:25,138
stuff out on the street you're not going

8134
07:24:25,138 --> 07:24:27,058
to leave your stuff unsecured why do you

8135
07:24:27,058 --> 07:24:28,978
do that to the equipment why would you

8136
07:24:28,978 --> 07:24:31,558
do that to your computer it's like so we

8137
07:24:31,558 --> 07:24:33,420
need to show them that way and learn how

8138
07:24:33,420 --> 07:24:35,760
to communicate with them better it's

8139
07:24:35,760 --> 07:24:38,638
like it's not on them uh to learn it

8140
07:24:38,638 --> 07:24:43,100
it's to us to communicate it better

8141
07:24:44,940 --> 07:24:47,760
any other questions yes

8142
07:24:47,760 --> 07:24:49,320
oh and by the way I'm not really

8143
07:24:49,320 --> 07:24:50,580
screaming at you it's like I know they

8144
07:24:50,580 --> 07:24:53,638
said I get very greasy I'm like rude

8145
07:24:53,638 --> 07:24:56,160
trust me I'm screaming at everybody here

8146
07:24:56,160 --> 07:24:58,558
information security it's like it's a

8147
07:24:58,558 --> 07:25:01,860
group group session uh Jason uh just

8148
07:25:01,860 --> 07:25:03,600
thank you for the book uh it's actually

8149
07:25:03,600 --> 07:25:06,120
good to see the the footage off the air

8150
07:25:06,120 --> 07:25:08,040
in the story with everything I see

8151
07:25:08,040 --> 07:25:10,680
together uh it's from your experience uh

8152
07:25:10,680 --> 07:25:12,058
do you think it's a good idea to read

8153
07:25:12,058 --> 07:25:15,298
the device employees uh oh my God yes

8154
07:25:15,298 --> 07:25:17,400
it's like uh that's a whole other talk

8155
07:25:17,400 --> 07:25:19,320
it's like actually what I'm working on

8156
07:25:19,320 --> 07:25:22,500
but uh it's called gamification

8157
07:25:22,500 --> 07:25:26,100
and that is priceless this one thing

8158
07:25:26,100 --> 07:25:27,900
that you can take away right now that

8159
07:25:27,900 --> 07:25:30,240
you should be doing is going to your

8160
07:25:30,240 --> 07:25:34,740
management and saying I want you know 2

8161
07:25:34,740 --> 07:25:38,638
000 Rand it's like or 5 000 Rand every

8162
07:25:38,638 --> 07:25:39,718
quarter

8163
07:25:39,718 --> 07:25:43,260
to give away and a gift card or some

8164
07:25:43,260 --> 07:25:44,760
kind of gift card tonight I wouldn't be

8165
07:25:44,760 --> 07:25:46,978
able to get five thousand dollars or a

8166
07:25:46,978 --> 07:25:49,740
five thousand Grand away every quarter

8167
07:25:49,740 --> 07:25:52,620
and then what you do is you have a

8168
07:25:52,620 --> 07:25:54,660
grapple system

8169
07:25:54,660 --> 07:25:57,360
you found a suspicious email

8170
07:25:57,360 --> 07:25:59,700
you get a ticket to the raffle not like

8171
07:25:59,700 --> 07:26:01,378
a physical but you get like entry into

8172
07:26:01,378 --> 07:26:04,138
the to the raffle it's like hey you

8173
07:26:04,138 --> 07:26:06,298
block someone from walking in because

8174
07:26:06,298 --> 07:26:07,680
they didn't have a badge you're doing

8175
07:26:07,680 --> 07:26:09,718
security and it was reported you just

8176
07:26:09,718 --> 07:26:12,780
got 20 entries right there you reported

8177
07:26:12,780 --> 07:26:15,360
a phishing email that turned out to be

8178
07:26:15,360 --> 07:26:18,298
an actual phishing email for a test look

8179
07:26:18,298 --> 07:26:20,940
you just got too many rapper tickets to

8180
07:26:20,940 --> 07:26:23,638
get inside your cost is always going to

8181
07:26:23,638 --> 07:26:27,298
be the same 5 000 Rand but I guarantee

8182
07:26:27,298 --> 07:26:30,478
you the participation is going to

8183
07:26:30,478 --> 07:26:34,200
increase every quarter because trust me

8184
07:26:34,200 --> 07:26:36,958
there will be people going like yeah I

8185
07:26:36,958 --> 07:26:38,458
don't really care about security I don't

8186
07:26:38,458 --> 07:26:40,040
know 5 000 rent

8187
07:26:40,040 --> 07:26:42,600
there was a lady in the United States

8188
07:26:42,600 --> 07:26:44,700
who reported

8189
07:26:44,700 --> 07:26:48,138
uh suspicious email from a co-worker

8190
07:26:48,138 --> 07:26:51,058
and she was like

8191
07:26:51,058 --> 07:26:54,540
20 minutes later Securities at her desk

8192
07:26:54,540 --> 07:26:57,240
and they're like why did you report this

8193
07:26:57,240 --> 07:26:58,978
why do you think was suspicious she

8194
07:26:58,978 --> 07:27:00,420
thinks she like told me to bust it right

8195
07:27:00,420 --> 07:27:02,160
she's freaking them out I'm like okay

8196
07:27:02,160 --> 07:27:05,760
okay I'm sorry it's like but tomorrow is

8197
07:27:05,760 --> 07:27:07,740
the deadline and it's like I didn't have

8198
07:27:07,740 --> 07:27:09,840
any injuries and it's like and he never

8199
07:27:09,840 --> 07:27:12,000
usually sends me emails it's like and

8200
07:27:12,000 --> 07:27:13,798
it's not supposed to I just never done

8201
07:27:13,798 --> 07:27:16,200
it so I thought maybe this would qualify

8202
07:27:16,200 --> 07:27:18,360
am I in trouble or something

8203
07:27:18,360 --> 07:27:20,760
his machine had been compromised for

8204
07:27:20,760 --> 07:27:22,740
over three weeks they were doing a pivot

8205
07:27:22,740 --> 07:27:24,058
act and trying to improve your

8206
07:27:24,058 --> 07:27:26,760
escalation into the network further and

8207
07:27:26,760 --> 07:27:29,160
she stopped that

8208
07:27:29,160 --> 07:27:31,520
she won the raffle

8209
07:27:31,520 --> 07:27:34,260
I guess you're wondering if like they

8210
07:27:34,260 --> 07:27:36,298
didn't do a drawing that quarter it was

8211
07:27:36,298 --> 07:27:39,000
hers but it's like and it was not

8212
07:27:39,000 --> 07:27:41,280
because she was being security conscious

8213
07:27:41,280 --> 07:27:44,820
but she knew what to look for because

8214
07:27:44,820 --> 07:27:47,580
there was something in it for her

8215
07:27:47,580 --> 07:27:50,340
do a game for your boys have a problem

8216
07:27:50,340 --> 07:27:52,138
where employees aren't actually checking

8217
07:27:52,138 --> 07:27:55,020
badges when they're going in have a game

8218
07:27:55,020 --> 07:27:58,378
called where's Waldo every quarter what

8219
07:27:58,378 --> 07:28:00,840
that means is you grab an employee at

8220
07:28:00,840 --> 07:28:01,978
random

8221
07:28:01,978 --> 07:28:04,920
and you take them in and you tell them

8222
07:28:04,920 --> 07:28:07,378
here's your badge you've got the same

8223
07:28:07,378 --> 07:28:09,840
controls it's got your same name but

8224
07:28:09,840 --> 07:28:12,240
instead of your picture on there it's

8225
07:28:12,240 --> 07:28:13,558
Waldo

8226
07:28:13,558 --> 07:28:16,080
and then they have to use it and just

8227
07:28:16,080 --> 07:28:18,540
stay cool and just use it and whoever

8228
07:28:18,540 --> 07:28:20,218
stops them

8229
07:28:20,218 --> 07:28:24,298
and spots Waldo gets money

8230
07:28:24,298 --> 07:28:27,420
and if it goes a whole quarter without

8231
07:28:27,420 --> 07:28:30,240
getting caught they get the money so

8232
07:28:30,240 --> 07:28:31,500
that way you don't have them collusion

8233
07:28:31,500 --> 07:28:33,120
with employees trying to get how you do

8234
07:28:33,120 --> 07:28:34,680
it it's like there's Lily's social

8235
07:28:34,680 --> 07:28:37,200
engineering your employees to be better

8236
07:28:37,200 --> 07:28:40,798
at protecting against social engineering

8237
07:28:40,798 --> 07:28:42,240
it's like

8238
07:28:42,240 --> 07:28:44,218
trust me it works because I said yeah

8239
07:28:44,218 --> 07:28:45,780
that's what that's about so gamification

8240
07:28:45,780 --> 07:28:48,180
is a perfect thing to do it's like

8241
07:28:48,180 --> 07:28:50,040
making a positive experience instead of

8242
07:28:50,040 --> 07:28:53,280
just like a quarterly you know multiple

8243
07:28:53,280 --> 07:28:55,620
choice question it's like that is boring

8244
07:28:55,620 --> 07:28:57,660
AF and then you can usually back out of

8245
07:28:57,660 --> 07:28:59,580
and like take the quiz again like oh I

8246
07:28:59,580 --> 07:29:02,360
can ask yay

8247
07:29:03,360 --> 07:29:05,218
you have questions everybody wants to

8248
07:29:05,218 --> 07:29:06,540
get up out of here and I totally agree

8249
07:29:06,540 --> 07:29:08,458
uh one more person and then I'm gonna

8250
07:29:08,458 --> 07:29:10,798
out of the word oh my God I am like

8251
07:29:10,798 --> 07:29:13,740
extremely late I apologize and I I

8252
07:29:13,740 --> 07:29:15,180
always laid on this because I just talk

8253
07:29:15,180 --> 07:29:17,340
too much but last one and the dolphin go

8254
07:29:17,340 --> 07:29:18,840
get prizes and drinks and stuff because

8255
07:29:18,840 --> 07:29:20,160
I'm the mother that's keeping you from

8256
07:29:20,160 --> 07:29:22,558
them uh in your tests have you ever used

8257
07:29:22,558 --> 07:29:24,540
a letter to get into an area you're not

8258
07:29:24,540 --> 07:29:27,298
supposed to uh have I ever used a lot um

8259
07:29:27,298 --> 07:29:28,860
in that one picture which was really

8260
07:29:28,860 --> 07:29:33,798
cool is I actually used the uh

8261
07:29:33,798 --> 07:29:36,478
there we go we'll be there I use the

8262
07:29:36,478 --> 07:29:40,558
anti-latter uh cage around the ladder to

8263
07:29:40,558 --> 07:29:43,440
climb up on the building I found a

8264
07:29:43,440 --> 07:29:45,718
pallet right by the dumpster a very

8265
07:29:45,718 --> 07:29:47,700
familiar with dumpsters uh and it's like

8266
07:29:47,700 --> 07:29:50,218
and if I dragged it over use that as the

8267
07:29:50,218 --> 07:29:51,298
first part of the ladder and then I

8268
07:29:51,298 --> 07:29:54,058
jumped up onto the outer ring of the

8269
07:29:54,058 --> 07:29:56,400
anti-climbing ladder device name and

8270
07:29:56,400 --> 07:29:58,320
then I just used that and the brackets

8271
07:29:58,320 --> 07:30:01,260
that was into the wall as my ladder to

8272
07:30:01,260 --> 07:30:04,500
climb all the way up money well spent uh

8273
07:30:04,500 --> 07:30:07,260
so uh I've never really used an actual

8274
07:30:07,260 --> 07:30:09,478
ladder ladder that I brought with me

8275
07:30:09,478 --> 07:30:11,100
because I'm cheap and it's like they're

8276
07:30:11,100 --> 07:30:12,958
heavy and I'm probably still the one

8277
07:30:12,958 --> 07:30:16,320
that's on the side so look up in 2017

8278
07:30:16,320 --> 07:30:20,458
Super Bowl three teams with a ladder and

8279
07:30:20,458 --> 07:30:23,280
you'll see three teenagers five thousand

8280
07:30:23,280 --> 07:30:25,320
uh Law Enforcement Officers Secret

8281
07:30:25,320 --> 07:30:27,660
Service National Guard at the Super Bowl

8282
07:30:27,660 --> 07:30:29,820
in Houston because the vice president

8283
07:30:29,820 --> 07:30:32,820
was in attendance and three teenagers

8284
07:30:32,820 --> 07:30:35,580
found a hole in the Lincoln offense got

8285
07:30:35,580 --> 07:30:38,040
in found the ladder and they all had the

8286
07:30:38,040 --> 07:30:40,200
brilliant idea like let's all turn the

8287
07:30:40,200 --> 07:30:42,360
ladder together and see where they got

8288
07:30:42,360 --> 07:30:43,740
everywhere

8289
07:30:43,740 --> 07:30:46,138
they got into like on on the near the

8290
07:30:46,138 --> 07:30:49,020
field they got into the little uh bunker

8291
07:30:49,020 --> 07:30:50,458
I don't do sports ball in the bunker

8292
07:30:50,458 --> 07:30:52,440
area where the players go it's like

8293
07:30:52,440 --> 07:30:54,718
locker room it's like they kind of into

8294
07:30:54,718 --> 07:30:57,180
the stands they got the guy Ferrari so

8295
07:30:57,180 --> 07:30:58,860
you get punishment I guess it's like

8296
07:30:58,860 --> 07:31:01,200
they got to make all the stuff and all

8297
07:31:01,200 --> 07:31:02,700
because they were holding it doesn't

8298
07:31:02,700 --> 07:31:05,298
matter and they YouTube it

8299
07:31:05,298 --> 07:31:08,100
so you can actually watch how they do it

8300
07:31:08,100 --> 07:31:10,798
so don't tell me this takes skill or

8301
07:31:10,798 --> 07:31:12,840
this takes some kind of like you know

8302
07:31:12,840 --> 07:31:15,360
gay I hate gatekeeping we're hackers at

8303
07:31:15,360 --> 07:31:17,700
the gate jump defense go under the fence

8304
07:31:17,700 --> 07:31:19,920
go around I'm not the one telling you

8305
07:31:19,920 --> 07:31:22,558
how to do it just do it so that's how

8306
07:31:22,558 --> 07:31:24,780
you gotta realize it's not that hard

8307
07:31:24,780 --> 07:31:26,760
because you're going against human

8308
07:31:26,760 --> 07:31:29,520
nature and human nature is easy to

8309
07:31:29,520 --> 07:31:32,340
manipulate once you realize what the

8310
07:31:32,340 --> 07:31:34,260
rules are

8311
07:31:34,260 --> 07:31:37,620
okay now I'm done bye thank you

8312
07:31:37,620 --> 07:31:39,739
thank you

8313
07:31:43,440 --> 07:31:45,540
[Applause]

8314
07:31:45,540 --> 07:31:48,920

8315
07:31:48,958 --> 07:31:53,120
okay thank you very much
