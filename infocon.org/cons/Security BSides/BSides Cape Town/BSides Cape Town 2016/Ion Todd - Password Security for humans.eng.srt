1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,048
I i wanted to do talk about password

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,690
security in a in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:13,599
hopefully so you can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in a way</font>

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will hopefully be aimed aimed at</font>

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,220
humans rather than than security people

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,590
because often we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these</font>

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,418
recommendations which technically makes

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:28,090
sense but just aren't feasible for users

9
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:29,410
so the what spawned this talk was a

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,110
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was having with one of</font>

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,510
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most senior guys at my at my</font>

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,429
company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was saying with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regards</font>

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,589
to giving giving recommendations like

14
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:40,719
don't be a typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec noob and just</font>

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,730
say what is definitely best practice if

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,660
it's not going to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the client</font>

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,910
because you just sort of wasting your

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,998
time so yeah that's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,519
behind this talk see I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting out</font>

20
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:53,649
as I said my name's iron I'm an infosec

21
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,620
consultant at<font color="#E5E5E5"> mwr I've been there about</font>

22
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,909
a year now I like hacking things and I'm

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,409
particularly interested in password

24
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">cracking and passwords in general so</font>

25
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,250
just a quick agenda we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look</font>

26
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,530
at attacking passwords how to protect

27
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,950
them what threats they are two general

28
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">users how to store and manage passwords</font>

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,100
and then right at the end just sort of

30
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,030
some research<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done in to pass</font>

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,710
phrase cracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so just before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,530
dive into it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of take a</font>

33
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,658
look at these passwords and try and try

34
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,280
and order them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just from</font>

35
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,890
least secure to most secure almost good

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,630
security secur just give you a couple of

37
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:37,479
seconds just to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get your head</font>

38
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,770
around us cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to come</font>

39
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,590
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide later we're going to</font>

40
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of background I</font>

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,009
guess so there's there's two types of I

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,259
guess primary attacks for going off to

43
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,509
passwords the first is online attacks so

44
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:55,600
a notable example of this is the I the

45
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:59,710
iCloud leak I'm sure most of you saw

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,750
that but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not some some guys got hold</font>

47
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,270
of private accounts of primarily

48
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:09,190
celebrities by two main attack vectors

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,900
primarily fishing but also exploiting an

50
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,079
API issue which didn't rate limits

51
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,740
guessing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an iCloud accounts so what</font>

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,030
they could do is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could just</font>

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuously</font>

54
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,650
guess passwords until they eventually

55
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:26,049
got in<font color="#E5E5E5"> so obviously the issue with this</font>

56
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it's slow and easily detected like</font>

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,980
you're you're you're limited by your

58
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">network connection you've gotta you</font>

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,340
gotta deal with TCP HTTP all that kind

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,600
of stuff just to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password</font>

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,910
across and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's got to get</font>

62
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,109
evaluated server side and obviously

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,579
usernames are required if you're going

64
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">off to a certain user you need the</font>

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,660
actual user name if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

66
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,500
off to any user you need a big list of

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,750
usernames<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and yeah so then the other</font>

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,790
way would be offline password attacks so

69
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is more what I'm interested</font>

70
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,820
in so one of the advantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,340
advantages of it is it's a lot faster

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,049
because you have the hashed passwords on

73
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,450
your database sorry on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard drive</font>

74
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,170
and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be you'd get a</font>

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,640
probably a forums database or some large

76
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,018
websites database and you would then

77
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,208
throw it into something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like John wash</font>

78
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">cat in order to try and recover and</font>

79
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,890
mahalo to passwords so a notable example

80
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,630
of this is linux mint<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure I'm</font>

81
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,570
not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Strauss's here I see he runs</font>

82
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:26,980
that on his desktop so i may or may not

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:29,500
have his passwords somewhere um yeah so

84
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,798
for those of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know i think they</font>

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,950
were running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wordpress site therefore</font>

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,660
we got hacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB dumped and the the iso</font>

87
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:43,600
was actually back toward for a day or so

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:45,310
and not so long ago um see I'm a hash

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,769
cat fanboy I don't use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John i</font>

90
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,450
recently found out you can do quite cool

91
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,859
things in John but yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

92
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,119
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at all so I'm just gonna</font>

93
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,820
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some basic hash cat attacks</font>

94
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,840
one can do so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most obvious example</font>

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,019
is dictionary attacks where you

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,230
essentially just take words and pass

97
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,430
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see what happens so ways you</font>

98
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,858
can build up these dictionaries are

99
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,720
plaintext password dumps so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rocky is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

100
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,209
big one I was a form damn many many

101
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,799
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago now but just any plane with</font>

102
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,930
plaintext passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get your</font>

103
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,900
hands on are usually going to be used

104
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,668
again things you've previously cracked

105
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,459
yourself just sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hash</font>

106
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">kappahd file keyboard patterns are</font>

107
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,880
something which uses actually used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

108
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,280
some reason so sort of if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,360
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qas dead</font>

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,650
SW so just up and down or left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,570
these there's large dictionaries for

112
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,039
that kind of stuff or so your numpad 7

113
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">53</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc and then you can do more exciting</font>

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can scrape websites get</font>

115
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,430
lyrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> from songs books wikipedia may be</font>

116
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,560
scraped like the b-sides website for

117
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,730
example so if you were to scrape<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">research website you probably get words</font>

119
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,510
like kept on besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> Table Mountain I PA</font>

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,180
pale ale just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cape town things</font>

121
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,789
so then another type of attack is rule

122
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,590
rule based attacks so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea here</font>

123
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,800
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of try and mimic how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

124
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,619
how users create passwords so maybe I

125
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,400
would upend an<font color="#E5E5E5"> S to a password or a one</font>

126
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">two three maybe I'm maybe I'm elite</font>

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,409
hacker hacks or so i replace my SS with

128
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,780
percentage sorry with dollar signs and

129
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of stuff or even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just reverse</font>

130
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,309
words just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

131
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,970
obviously combo rules together to create

132
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,130
more interesting passwords um and then

133
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,450
you get brute force attacks so not a not

134
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,950
a lot involved there you just sort of

135
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,500
gets all the combinations so for example

136
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,990
from A to Z and something else you can

137
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is you can actually brute force on a</font>

138
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,770
word list so you'll started secure

139
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,180
password and you can brute force past

140
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,599
that which actually gives you some

141
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool and some really cool</font>

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,360
advantages I'll show you show you one a

143
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,070
little bit later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a Combinator</font>

144
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,780
attack so that's literally just combine

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,700
two dictionaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we saw what a</font>

146
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,070
dictionary attack was now so we got

147
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,580
dictionary one defeat too much I've got

148
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,490
a laser laser<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointer nope see how we</font>

149
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,020
take sort of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> our previous dictionary</font>

150
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,700
one and we append it to quite simple

151
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,549
words and we are things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cape Town</font>

152
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,820
boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter Martin love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I pipl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah hello</font>

153
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,520
of cetera you guys can all get so the

154
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can die you can</font>

155
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,120
sort of crack longer passwords and this

156
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,490
is this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people often</font>

157
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:30,479
do um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so going back now we know how</font>

158
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,039
people like to attack passwords so just

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,530
what are good ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend the two</font>

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,270
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at so obviously</font>

161
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,099
for for online attacks a strong password

162
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy is really important try and</font>

163
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,590
increase the number of guesses

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,210
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since they're</font>

165
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,919
limited by the speed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

166
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,400
connection and server-side processing

167
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,560
and all that then obviously I can't

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,378
lockouts quite good too so if I guess

169
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">three incorrect login attempts maybe</font>

170
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,099
make me send an email to myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> or wait</font>

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,020
15 minutes exponentially back that off

172
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:04,719
over time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1530 and I or whatever and</font>

173
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,849
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logging and monitoring is is a</font>

174
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,009
really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to pick this up so say</font>

175
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,438
for example if either a user tried to

176
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">log in 10,000 times recently or all of</font>

177
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,870
my users tried password<font color="#CCCCCC"> one recently</font>

178
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,020
that that would probably be an indicator

179
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,460
of something bad happening and then for

180
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,900
offline attacks so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

181
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,239
different obviously we're not in front

182
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,818
in control of the server anymore they've

183
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,889
got all of our hashes and sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

184
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,080
their machine so they're not no longer

185
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,719
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> by our controls so what we can</font>

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is we can ensure that we're storing</font>

187
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,789
the password securely or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah securely I</font>

188
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,949
guess so once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong password</font>

189
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,090
policies important trying to increase

190
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,360
the guesses that they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform</font>

191
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then salted passwords and iterative</font>

192
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,300
hashing algorithms are really good so

193
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,409
we'll go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what that is in a sec</font>

194
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,569
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some water</font>

195
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:57,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">because my mouth's quite dry cool so</font>

196
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,500
what exactly is password salting

197
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,889
essentially you just add a unique value

198
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,250
to each password the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is to</font>

199
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,589
prevent look-up tables so back when md5

200
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,849
and sha-1 really big things people

201
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,650
created large look-up tables for these

202
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,779
they're called rainbow tables that's why

203
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,799
I included the little pride symbol there

204
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:20,740
I see ya just the the general idea is if

205
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120
I've if I've got password one say it's a

206
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,800
three of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my users have password one</font>

207
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,810
these will all have two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

208
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">if if different salts are applied which</font>

209
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,339
means that they can't they can't be

210
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked up and it'll slow down the</font>

211
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,380
guessing a lot um and then a sort of

212
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,349
final issue which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think people don't</font>

213
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of very often so the salted value</font>

214
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,279
needs to be calculated<font color="#CCCCCC"> for each guess</font>

215
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,260
which obviously makes sense but um the

216
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:48,220
effect this has on on the amount of

217
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:51,579
guesses is is more than more than people

218
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,839
sometimes think so the slides actually

219
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,189
by similar to the previous slide I

220
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,170
couldn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good way to convey this</font>

221
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:02,470
but um sorry what<font color="#CCCCCC"> am I trying to say</font>

222
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,209
okay yes so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

223
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,149
password salt and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look it up</font>

224
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:09,819
in my my list of hash files so I I work

225
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and I look it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

226
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:13,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try pass through with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a neck salt</font>

227
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,810
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that again so essentially</font>

228
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this means is that for every for</font>

229
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,390
every hash that I'm I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying against I</font>

230
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,399
then like this multiplies each each

231
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,990
guess are making sorry yeah I've got a

232
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,490
vertical cater for each guesser making

233
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,260
so this essentially is sort of like

234
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,329
blows up the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guesses one needs</font>

235
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make for each each password they're</font>

236
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:37,209
comparing which obviously slows things

237
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:39,430
down quite a lot another way to slow

238
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:42,010
things down is iterative hashing

239
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,079
algorithms so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why not</font>

240
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,339
md5 i'm sure you guys all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

241
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,910
empty fibers will have seen empty five

242
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:51,339
at some point so the md in<font color="#E5E5E5"> md5 stands</font>

243
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">for message digest as far as i know and</font>

244
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,920
this was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> for checking the</font>

245
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,189
integrity of things of files to see if

246
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,800
they'd been an until intentionally or

247
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,990
unintentionally modified during transit

248
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,750
so these these algorithms are made for

249
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,850
speed that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

250
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">calculated fast on on for example large</font>

251
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,350
files in order to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> their integrity</font>

252
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,610
which is at odds with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's what we</font>

253
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,350
want from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password hashing algorithm</font>

254
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:22,449
so because devs are often charge of this

255
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,250
we thought how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make things slower</font>

256
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,260
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do it over and over again</font>

257
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,420
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much where a direita</font>

258
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,300
fashioning algorithms came from so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

259
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,560
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash you work it out once and</font>

260
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,790
then you just go into a loop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

261
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,229
just keep working it out based on the

262
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:40,260
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> value so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zeroth value</font>

263
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,370
determines the first value etc etc etc

264
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">and at the end you just return out the</font>

265
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,800
hash um so obviously if i'm doing

266
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,560
something two thousand times per per

267
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,589
guest it slows things down considerably

268
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,018
but more importantly what this does is

269
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,250
so GPUs are really good at password

270
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,779
cracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the fact that</font>

271
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,250
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got multiple calls which can</font>

272
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:04,870
then take advantage of parallel

273
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:07,690
processing what what it rid of hashing

274
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,600
do is they prevent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gpus from</font>

275
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,839
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take advantage of their</font>

276
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,450
their parallel abilities so yeah GPUs

277
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,560
really good at maths vector stuff and

278
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,480
and parallelism whereas if I'm waiting

279
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,939
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really I</font>

280
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,390
can't really do this so what this ends

281
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,490
up meaning is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs are often faster</font>

282
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:35,710
on uncertain hash hashing algorithms

283
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:37,270
like this then GPS which is yeah which

284
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:43,750
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ruins the idea of a faster</font>

285
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:45,970
cracking rig so moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to moving on</font>

286
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,950
to why why secure password policies so

287
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,870
the the idea is we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to force users</font>

288
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,779
to have passed which which contain as

289
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,760
much entropy as possible we know that

290
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,130
pass passwords are going to be chosen

291
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,040
based on the absolute minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

292
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,439
user has to put in so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if</font>

293
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,849
I've got a lowercase uppercase digits

294
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,400
and maybe a special i'm going to choose

295
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,560
maybe password one with a ! with

296
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,400
something similar maybe my name

297
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,500
capitalized yeah so that's that's the

298
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,329
idea um I generally hate entropy

299
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,029
calculations but i'll do a really basic

300
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,160
one here so essentially the idea is

301
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,790
character set we've got lowercase

302
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,020
uppercase digits that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 62 characters</font>

303
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,719
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the worst case number</font>

304
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,640
of guesses for a an eight digit password

305
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,020
is 62<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the eighth so character set</font>

306
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,720
times characters at times characters at

307
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:39,520
them characters at eight times um so

308
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,290
that's the general idea and yeah

309
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,270
essentially we want to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

310
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,360
entropy so we say things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> digit</font>

311
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,220
specials as much as possible and what

312
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,670
that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve is essentially</font>

313
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,740
this so all this graph shows us just you

314
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,920
can pretty much ignore the days of the

315
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,740
left so<font color="#E5E5E5"> X X is number of characters for</font>

316
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,060
those you can see and why is time and as

317
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,380
we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of eight nine</font>

318
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,819
ten the the amount of time increases

319
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,140
exponentially which starts to make these

320
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:14,320
types of things infeasible so yeah

321
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,439
that's that's the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original approach</font>

322
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,620
or the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way it's historically</font>

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,330
been done

324
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,630
but we're starting to see a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

325
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,740
shift recently so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe shall I</font>

326
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,530
think that's his name the guy from

327
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,090
Stan's post he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> chatting about about</font>

328
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,660
geo political stuff earlier mentioned

329
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,940
nest so nest is the American who I knew

330
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,290
this earlier something about standards

331
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,550
what is necessary again national<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

332
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">guy so yeah national institute of</font>

333
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,290
standards and technology and they're

334
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,790
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for creating a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

335
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,550
types of standards i think they also do

336
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,400
the the Shah competition to create the

337
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,920
new the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new char algorithm and they've</font>

338
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,390
recently come up with some new password

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,189
some password requirements which people

340
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,970
will have to abide by in order to take

341
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:05,600
advantage of the fifteen percent fifteen

342
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,580
percent konawa do so much 15 sorry tax

343
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate yes exactly the tax break for for</font>

344
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,480
complying with<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST so um what they've</font>

345
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,189
said is some some basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

346
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,580
minimum of eight characters we all know

347
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,260
eight characters is borderline but quite

348
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,870
a big thing is what they've also said is

349
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,760
maximum of 64 characters so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolute</font>

350
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,710
minimum maximum that's someone who

351
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,240
complies with Miss can set is 64 which

352
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,090
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to set</font>

353
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,190
a 64 character password at least on a

354
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,940
nest compliant website which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite</font>

355
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,240
big for for password manager users and

356
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,530
maybe people who like to type sentences

357
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,090
no password expiry so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

358
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,740
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommending for a while but</font>

359
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it still seems to creep in every now and</font>

360
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,880
then resetting your password every three

361
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,020
months doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> add security it does</font>

362
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,020
mitigate or like a diminished exposure

363
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,699
so if your password<font color="#CCCCCC"> does get breached</font>

364
00:14:53,020 --> 00:15:00,439
you're only the attacker only hazard for

365
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,570
X amount of time but what often happens

366
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,720
with password expiry is the fact that

367
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,010
you'll just append one to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> number or</font>

368
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,080
change your special character or

369
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,550
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it often doesn't</font>

370
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:16,430
add the intended security and also just

371
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,420
disallow known bad passwords so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

372
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite common</font>

373
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,199
in password<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies at least for good</font>

374
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,579
websites where you'll try and set your

375
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,800
password the password and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say sorry</font>

376
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,630
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this blacklist and password</font>

377
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,870
isn't that blacklist so you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

378
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,060
able to set that password you can use

379
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">old breaches and stuff too quick</font>

380
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,900
it is ok so just now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've we've</font>

381
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,550
got this knowledge we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going back</font>

382
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the less we looked at the beginning</font>

383
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,380
so the gist of it is all of these

384
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are bad sorry did I go louder</font>

385
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,460
there so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is just</font>

386
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,110
dictionary plus a rule the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

387
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,090
a Polish word which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a different</font>

388
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,670
kind of dictionary we've got a keyboard

389
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,650
walk which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused yeah ma can try and</font>

390
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">pronounce that we've got mountain love</font>

391
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,640
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a really common Cape</font>

392
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ternion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one correct horse batteries</font>

393
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,720
staple yeah I think we've all seen the

394
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,340
comic I didn't feel the need to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

395
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,300
up sometimes your words just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hypnotize</font>

396
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:15,320
me is a biggie song and educate yourself

397
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,260
if you don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is and then</font>

398
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> earth security strategic strategy</font>

399
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,520
strategic at is actually just a scrape

400
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,050
from the b-sides website an actual

401
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">scrape from the research website um</font>

402
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:31,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually just a typer on</font>

403
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,690
the website yeah so whilst some of these

404
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,630
might look better than others they're

405
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're all not much really great and if</font>

406
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,350
we if we take a good approach to

407
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,290
cracking these passwords so then moving

408
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,080
on to the personal space um what do I as

409
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,569
a user of passwords so someone who

410
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,970
interacts with with technology have to

411
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,980
do in order to keep myself secure so I

412
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,440
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all know we've seen some quite</font>

413
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,600
big high-profile breaches recently so

414
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Dropbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lincoln you guys can read all</font>

415
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,240
the logos that on there um these are

416
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,620
websites we typically trust and their

417
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,760
databases are getting dumped and ending

418
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,819
up in the hands of essentially bad guys

419
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,129
and and also on that so Ashley Madison

420
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,689
adult friend finder for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who don't</font>

421
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,680
know these are sort of a fair websites

422
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:20,330
or like cheat on your partner websites

423
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,220
where you're not awfully worried about

424
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,770
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password not being correctly hash</font>

425
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,350
you more worried about your wife leaving

426
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,690
and taking everything which which is

427
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be the outcome of that so yeah</font>

428
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,150
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try I'm not going to</font>

429
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,160
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any recommendations to protect</font>

430
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:40,080
you against<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't be a dick</font>

431
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,050
but but yeah I'm for general password

432
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,720
security let's see what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so</font>

433
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,250
yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the the problem the reason</font>

434
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,050
people actually get affected is because

435
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,900
of password reuse so what will happen is

436
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,970
I'm a bad guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I breach your database I</font>

437
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,740
then sell it to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bad guys who</font>

438
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,290
will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crack the passwords and</font>

439
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,260
then either sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on or try and try</font>

440
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,649
and abused other social media or

441
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,920
whatever account using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same password</font>

442
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:11,910
um and we know that password reuse is

443
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,910
bad and hey man I do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure most of</font>

444
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,700
you guys do it but how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we stop it so</font>

445
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,350
the obvious the obvious thing that like

446
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,150
an infosec noob for example would say is

447
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,340
generate random unique password and they

448
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be so long and all that but how can</font>

449
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,220
we reasonably do that as as users who

450
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,710
have other concerns in our life and so I

451
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,580
thought maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> password managers um I'm</font>

452
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,800
not going to get into a debate about

453
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,570
which one's the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key pass but</font>

454
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,820
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> people start wars about this</font>

455
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,899
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm really not going to</font>

456
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,389
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and these are these are</font>

457
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,580
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> really popular ones so take a look</font>

458
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,840
at whatever you want so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of a</font>

459
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,480
positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager story that's slightly</font>

460
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,889
misaligned so that fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is that</font>

461
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got one really big secure</font>

462
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,520
password in order to unlock all your

463
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,350
other passwords you don't have to

464
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,770
remember anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than your your</font>

465
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,449
one secure password um but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

466
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,610
still means is that you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> one at</font>

467
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,260
least one secure passage which a lot of

468
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,560
people don't have so um just in terms of

469
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,240
usability of key pass here's here's the

470
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,790
kinds of things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do so generating</font>

471
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,130
password is is incredibly simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

472
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,330
took a new profile type in the website

473
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want it to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can</font>

474
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,070
select what you want so say this is

475
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,139
something i do if i see that it's a bad

476
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,840
website i'll leave out wide spaces and

477
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,250
minus just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it isn't being</font>

478
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,100
escape properly ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> messes with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

479
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,740
website but yeah you can choose you can

480
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,570
toggle the<font color="#E5E5E5"> check box to make your length</font>

481
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,300
increase and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the past if you</font>

482
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,310
don't like it generate a new one this

483
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,450
isn't the password i'm using by by the

484
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,200
way so

485
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,970
yeah and then just in terms of usability

486
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,409
so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> typed in a password other</font>

487
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,169
than my keepass password in quite a

488
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:56,850
while there's there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool things</font>

489
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,760
like control be for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username control</font>

490
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,949
C for the for the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font>

491
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,649
magic one control V so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

492
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,750
point it at a at a login page and hit

493
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:08,729
control V and it'll sort of lucky and

494
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,309
automatically and do some some

495
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:15,090
misdirection so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you're</font>

496
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:16,408
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> key logged it'll be harder to for</font>

497
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,908
the attack to get your password set sort

498
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:26,130
of back spaces a bitten types random

499
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:29,669
characters and all that yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so um</font>

500
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,080
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> often that will be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the HTML</font>

501
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,630
element where you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> set pasting</font>

502
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,610
is disabled um and then you can just

503
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,649
toggle it back on you just take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out</font>

504
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,209
of the HTML element<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but there are</font>

505
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,949
times when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to actually type</font>

506
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,250
it in manually and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will do</font>

507
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,480
it so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the one of the</font>

508
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,250
password when you're when you're

509
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,230
creating a new password like the either

510
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,539
the confirm or the previous one like the

511
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,659
first one will allow posting but the

512
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,580
other one won't see ya if that's the

513
00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually a much if I've got</font>

514
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,730
it here or cut off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top but you can</font>

515
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,469
there's like a tab at the top which lets

516
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,870
you create different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passwords</font>

517
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,190
so yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pull open my</font>

518
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep us right now but I you can choose</font>

519
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,580
passwords that are for example

520
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,699
pronounceable which are easier to type

521
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,379
and and all that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and yeah</font>

522
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,519
you can also play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the character set</font>

523
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,250
a bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just maybe just increase the</font>

524
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:29,399
length and to maintain entropy but also

525
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,990
type ability um yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sorry that's a</font>

526
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,639
bit small so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is one of the issues</font>

527
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,649
which I'll discuss on the side so

528
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:36,059
obviously personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager is really</font>

529
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:38,279
cool what I can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique passwords</font>

530
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,470
and I don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember many</font>

531
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,730
passwords just just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one maybe my</font>

532
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,679
gmail password which is I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type</font>

533
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,690
on my phone every now and then a type of

534
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,220
stuff and changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords is really</font>

535
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,139
easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just click regenerate button</font>

536
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,730
and obviously copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste it into the</font>

537
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:52,979
change password field and then you're

538
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,809
good but but they're they're quite a lot

539
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cons so the specialized software</font>

540
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">people see this is quite a big barrier</font>

541
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,590
to entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure why it's actually</font>

542
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,060
really easy and also you need at least

543
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,620
one secure password as I said many

544
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,510
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have even one secure</font>

545
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,860
password so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to find</font>

546
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,680
a way to generate that we'll chat about

547
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,139
that in the following slides um and then

548
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,130
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really big issue or the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two are</font>

549
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,380
really big issues so syncing between

550
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,250
devices which means for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example on my</font>

551
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,830
work pc and my home pc i want maybe my

552
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,480
med bitbucket<font color="#CCCCCC"> heroku that kind of stuff</font>

553
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to kill passwords on those but i</font>

554
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,340
also want those sinks between between

555
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">those two computers and then manually</font>

556
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,419
entering passwords so often you'll

557
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,550
encounter things like having to type

558
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,350
passwords on your phone primarily maybe

559
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,379
into your your new<font color="#E5E5E5"> Smart Case ball you</font>

560
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,959
bought I know I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew Mac has like</font>

561
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,050
lots of IOT devices in his home

562
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,200
which which he has two connectors his

563
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,669
network and also there's a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

564
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,320
of failure so that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there</font>

565
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been issues with with bastard</font>

566
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,600
managers in the past um but but I don't

567
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:00,440
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a huge issue everything has</font>

568
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,719
has 0 days um but just on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so most</font>

569
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,130
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues have been in pastured</font>

570
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,600
managers in the browser please do not

571
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">store your passwords in the browser I</font>

572
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,709
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know way too much about or</font>

573
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,110
hopefully everyone's at least heard that

574
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,180
browser exploits are fairly common and

575
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:20,659
that sounds like a bad idea for example

576
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oday like recently cool so as I</font>

577
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,210
said in previous slide we actually need

578
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out how to generate at least</font>

579
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,290
one secure password so let's look at

580
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hate entropy</font>

581
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,639
calculations so I've I've fudged the

582
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,780
numbers a bit just because I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a</font>

583
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,460
number that long and I don't like ease

584
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,360
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is what's the</font>

585
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,920
difference between password in a

586
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,399
passphrase you're using them pretty

587
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,980
interchangeably up till now um but yeah

588
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,780
how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the difference so it's</font>

589
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,910
quite open the definition I don't think

590
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,090
it's been strictly defined but my the

591
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,520
way I define it is multiple words for

592
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,350
example a sentence not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily a</font>

593
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,879
sentence that makes sense but just

594
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple words put together preferably</font>

595
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">with spaces but not necessarily yeah so</font>

596
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,169
that's how I would define us and then

597
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,000
what makes a good pass phrase so how do

598
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,100
i how do i generate a pass phrase that

599
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,180
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than a password and and why</font>

600
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,370
are these better than passwords

601
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,480
so yeah just taking a look at entropy so

602
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,550
we say we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lowercase plus</font>

603
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">uppercase to the power of eight that's</font>

604
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,720
not an awful lot you can do the math

605
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,669
yourself if you don't believe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but</font>

606
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,070
then I then I generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> an a similar</font>

607
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,660
passphrase which is a eight words long

608
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,080
which is Cape Town is great this time of

609
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:32,270
year and if I were to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it using</font>

610
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,429
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same the same entropy requirements i</font>

611
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,170
would say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example lowercase</font>

612
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,990
uppercase spaces to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power 44 which</font>

613
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,340
is an unbelievably large number that's

614
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,290
infeasible this posture will never be

615
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,850
cracked I can use this forever etc um

616
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,639
but that's not true this is why I don't

617
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">like entropy calculations because the</font>

618
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,760
way to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is words in</font>

619
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,630
the English language to the power of

620
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight because for the most part you will</font>

621
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,070
include English words in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

622
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,439
passphrase not necessarily you can

623
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,270
probably fight me about that later but I

624
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,710
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more reasonable way of</font>

625
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,810
looking at it which then essentially

626
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,220
just makes it the words in the English

627
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:14,090
language are your character set which is

628
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,770
obviously more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 26 or 50 52 to the</font>

629
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,320
power of 8 which is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

630
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:23,900
considerably large but significantly

631
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,540
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> then lots um so ways to</font>

632
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,130
generate these these passwords are going

633
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,720
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at three different types so the</font>

634
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">first is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dice where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shift has anyone</font>

635
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,030
heard of lice web for general nod<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

636
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,270
like two people so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> swear works</font>

637
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:41,389
is there are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dictionaries and</font>

638
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:44,210
they sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of map</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to word so they're</font>

639
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,460
indexed by values which are all

640
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,000
essentially the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a dice so like</font>

641
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,300
a d6 so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it works is you roll 5</font>

642
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,040
die dies I don't know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get</font>

643
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,360
the order they get the index for your

644
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,129
first word and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeat this</font>

645
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:03,070
process over and over to create as many

646
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:07,100
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many words as you deem fit so yeah</font>

647
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,689
hopefully that makes sense so what are

648
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issues with I swear it sounds like a</font>

649
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,120
great deal obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get quite a lot</font>

650
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of randomness I'm literally just rolling</font>

651
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,620
a dice to create my password no one's in

652
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,080
control of that if I'm if I'm very

653
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,840
paranoid no one's given me this password

654
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,418
I've done it myself and yeah hopefully

655
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,918
my die isn't it just

656
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,779
but there's yeah as I said there's quite

657
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,870
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of content so the dice where</font>

658
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,820
dictionary is at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> until recently</font>

659
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,889
have included many really weird words so

660
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,980
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just examples of words so</font>

661
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:42,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Derek it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mondo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Seneca the character ?</font>

662
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,789
etc I guess jars word I don't know why I

663
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,679
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in there um but then the issue</font>

664
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:50,419
like this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of filters down to the</font>

665
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,220
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so if I've got words that I</font>

666
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,320
don't understand or can't use readily um

667
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,139
it's a lot harder to remember passphrase

668
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,360
that contains them so cleft cancer sino

669
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:02,090
it whatever um that passphrase over

670
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,408
there is not one I created in order to

671
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,178
prove a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is literally the</font>

672
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:07,940
example they give on their website as a

673
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,470
sample passphrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that just makes no</font>

674
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me i'm i think i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

675
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,929
struggle to to memorize that granted not

676
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,639
as hard as as a completely random

677
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,929
password but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly what I'm</font>

678
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:23,449
looking for in a passphrase so

679
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:27,110
fortunately for us there's a great

680
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,600
startup called P Rio and they do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

681
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,370
they do so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do instant</font>

682
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,139
messaging something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

683
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,590
they're selling point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that is super</font>

684
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:38,449
secure and they do some complicated key

685
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,299
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> root derivations schemes and all that</font>

686
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,669
and they recently actually did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour</font>

687
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass phrases for humans I thought</font>

688
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had stolen both their title and their</font>

689
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,760

690
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">fortunately I hadn't but they did some</font>

691
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,080
really cool work into generating word

692
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,809
lists forward I swear type password

693
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,080
generation but wordless that make more

694
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:01,490
sense so they what they did they did

695
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,240
squad research into this actually so

696
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:08,090
they they took they figured out how many

697
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,889
words the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom percentile of</font>

698
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:13,370
people know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i think i was about</font>

699
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:15,049
15,000 in English that is and they aimed

700
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,268
it to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was about the 15th</font>

701
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,309
percentile so sort of 15 percentile app

702
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:21,049
is quite a large amount of people

703
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:24,110
especially if you consider a bell curve

704
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,690
so they target<font color="#CCCCCC"> their the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

705
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:28,760
complexity of their words towards that

706
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:33,860
they then do things like remove words

707
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,269
which could be considered yeah which

708
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,740
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be offended by its twenty</font>

709
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:39,350
sixteen people get offended a lot so

710
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,760
they removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those words um and then</font>

711
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,889
they they came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this this call</font>

712
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,539
set of words which hopefully make a lot

713
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,070
more sense than I swear<font color="#E5E5E5"> words so here's</font>

714
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,990
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example decent shell dripping</font>

715
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,389
handy industry granted this makes no

716
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,299
sense but I know all of those words i

717
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:55,279
can probably spell them and if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

718
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,320
remember them individually i can i can

719
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,940
probably recreate my passphrase so

720
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,110
they've actually got this really cool

721
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,490
site where you can select your<font color="#E5E5E5"> language</font>

722
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:05,029
and select your length and just keep

723
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,289
generating and um sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said there</font>

724
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,779
for quite a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to get</font>

725
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:12,950
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> past razors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah they're really</font>

726
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">great and definitely check them out so</font>

727
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,690
the pros of the frozen period are there

728
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:20,870
the past races are definitely easier to

729
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,909
remember but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily easy and</font>

730
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,529
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard word so they put a lot</font>

731
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,269
of effort into making sure that everyone

732
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,179
can most people can understand the words

733
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,529
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used the cons are they're</font>

734
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,029
generating the passphrase for you so you

735
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:33,019
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of control over exact</font>

736
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:36,139
what you're getting obviously you can

737
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:37,340
keep clicking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the button but um some</font>

738
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:40,789
people prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control over what</font>

739
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:43,539
their choosing and the the pass phrases

740
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,549
are at best abstract and nonsensical

741
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:50,000
they just yeah they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just aren't on</font>

742
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:52,250
something which users can can remember

743
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,720
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so yeah they lack meaning to the</font>

744
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:59,330
user so this is I see the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide is</font>

745
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,980
actually not what I thought it was um so

746
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep talking over now</font>

747
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:08,750
so so what I did is um at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

748
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,879
of the year I joined a security company

749
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,559
knowing not a lot about security and I

750
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:14,090
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose some some secure passwords</font>

751
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,370
after you get like Lux encryption

752
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:20,209
password so encryption on your hard

753
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,518
drive keepass and my my sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted</font>

754
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,200
self password and had to generate these

755
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,179
in quite a short amount of time so

756
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,669
here's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did because I'm I'm a</font>

757
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,779
flippin noob or learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fight I</font>

758
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:34,909
want and so essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is I</font>

759
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,580
base these on natural language um so

760
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:39,169
books poems movies etc you take

761
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,629
something at least at least marginally

762
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:45,810
related to that and then screw with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

763
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:48,030
so that hopefully someone like me can't

764
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's crack it again so I did this I</font>

765
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,790
came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these passwords i still use</font>

766
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,500
them and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i decided hey what can I</font>

767
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,149
actually crack them like could someone

768
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">like me reasonably cracked my passwords</font>

769
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,310
so what I did is I did some research

770
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this um the the first the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

771
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,120
thing I did is I tried in grams so is

772
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,880
everyone familiar with in grams or

773
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,889
actually so what Anna gram is is you you

774
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,030
take sentence and you just chunk it so n

775
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,130
is like like in and maths so it can

776
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,550
change so you guess by grams trigrams

777
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">four grams five grams etc and so these</font>

778
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,240
are trigrams of the sentence I love the

779
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,440
smell<font color="#CCCCCC"> of napalm in the morning which</font>

780
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,190
apparently I'm too young<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font>

781
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,360
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ thanks for us see</font>

782
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,710
essentially you just sort of trunk the

783
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,780
chunks of sentence and see what happens

784
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,400
obviously trigrams on super useful for

785
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:39,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">pass phrases but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as it gets longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

786
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:43,980
you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get some good hits um so</font>

787
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:47,040
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some actual engrams</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got many</font>

788
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,900
of these are based on religion so I'm

789
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,550
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what that says I guess it's</font>

790
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,580
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember Bible verses especially</font>

791
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:56,100
if it's something you grew up with so

792
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,419
yeah they're also quite dark so dark the

793
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,560
kind of man there's no fate but what

794
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,630
make that's actually a terminated

795
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:06,149
reference great great one that um and

796
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,160
then I took a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Markov chains so I</font>

797
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,620
did some work with Markov chains at

798
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">University I'm sure most of you have</font>

799
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,000
encountered<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in maths at some point</font>

800
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,320
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of a Markov chain is when</font>

801
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,240
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to butcher this but</font>

802
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,950
essentially it's just a state with

803
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,280
percentages in order to transfer to the

804
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,810
new state so for example at state<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've</font>

805
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">got thirty-three percent chance to</font>

806
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,950
transfer to state<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't and I've got</font>

807
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,200
sixty-six percent chance to try and

808
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,270
stick to go to like so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

809
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,930
can build a sentence of of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Markov chains</font>

810
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:39,389
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like butter etc you can all</font>

811
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,920
read that um so Markov chains actually

812
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,580
come up in traditional password cracking

813
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:48,540
quite a lot as well aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can create</font>

814
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,860
words based on the dictionary so if i

815
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,710
crack enough polish passwords for

816
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,040
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out that I don't</font>

817
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:58,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> valves valves aren't great lots of</font>

818
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,509
consonants usually appear together and I

819
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,549
can

820
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,709
crack pradesh passwords based just<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

821
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:06,699
of learning from the from the data set

822
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:08,079
um see how what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is I sorry I</font>

823
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,940
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> skipped this man i wish i</font>

824
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,678
didn't leave that slide so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

825
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,559
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engrams a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Markov</font>

826
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,399
chains and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the later one is I went and I</font>

827
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,349
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went and I I didn't listen to many</font>

828
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,908
people's terms of service so I just

829
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,269
scraped as much data as I could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

830
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:28,449
dead little hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my scrapbook songs</font>

831
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:30,159
like everything and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's quite an</font>

832
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:33,399
issue right now because I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

833
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">share this what I've done but like I</font>

834
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,619
think there's quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trouble if</font>

835
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:40,329
I do I definitely read some terms of

836
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:44,109
service which I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking in the</font>

837
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:49,418
process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but I had fun and and</font>

838
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:51,639
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that matters so um yes so the</font>

839
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:53,799
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you take quite a lot of big text</font>

840
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,269
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can then train a markov</font>

841
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,839
chain once I've scraped all of eminem

842
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:01,690
songs or biggie songs to do for example

843
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,399
rap like biggie and the layer the larger

844
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,419
your data set is the the better it'll

845
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:09,960
get obviously it's no lyrical genius so

846
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:12,309
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some markov chains</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got i</font>

847
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,659
think so<font color="#E5E5E5"> markov chains are interesting</font>

848
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:15,869
because i managed to get my ex's

849
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,269
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boss's password both on the</font>

850
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:21,429
on the same type of type of attack which

851
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:25,178
i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great i'm not sure</font>

852
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:29,829
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one came from um and then I</font>

853
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:31,389
did some sentence analysis so my

854
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:33,490
sentence analysis were the great idea

855
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,200
didn't turn out so well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

856
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,459
behind it was find out where sentences

857
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,699
look like so with regards to figures of

858
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,409
speech so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna pause a whole lot of</font>

859
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">sentences that I see in text and i'm</font>

860
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to create sort of skeleton</font>

861
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:46,480
sentences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> consist of the figures of</font>

862
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,139
speech so a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious example would</font>

863
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,859
be noun verb noun so I n kicks ball or

864
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,919
whatever and I can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

865
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,569
substitute in different nouns into into

866
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,140
that sentence in order to try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

867
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:03,910
more reasonable result so yeah that was

868
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea sounded great at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time did</font>

869
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:10,200
not work out very well so yeah just an

870
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,730
example of what that would look like

871
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,649
this obviously shows one of it the

872
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,540
issues with with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> training set is I</font>

873
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,349
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about NLT k which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

874
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,490
natural language toolkit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python and</font>

875
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,530
so for example these aren't all the same

876
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,689
figures of speech i obviously didn't

877
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,750
train my data correctly but yeah that's

878
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea so our town thought hits new</font>

879
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:35,320
here that was the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it um and</font>

880
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,050
then some some sentence analysis based

881
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,150
past<font color="#CCCCCC"> races</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you'll never guess this</font>

882
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,369
password I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I</font>

883
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,440
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hug that guy man I feel</font>

884
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad and Romeo and Juliet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

885
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,160
each other that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great one and so</font>

886
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,130
this I'm lying a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit this was</font>

887
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a like this part was a brute</font>

888
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:57,460
force although it could have also been

889
00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:00,609
from a Combinator attack so yeah that

890
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,810
was what I did I had some fun but I

891
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:07,299
didn't get really good results and

892
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:09,430
that's pretty much it so um all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

893
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,920
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away from this is when</font>

894
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,240
generating passphrases if you're going

895
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and be a dumbass and</font>

896
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,890
choose natural language based

897
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,839
passphrases try to just yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

898
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider these things so plus razors are</font>

899
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,279
vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks

900
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,009
as normal passwords dictionary attacks I

901
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,950
think I've beat that to death rule-based

902
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,510
attacks i can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of things</font>

903
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,689
especially with really really

904
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:37,180
complicated rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can often just with</font>

905
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,710
like a random large set of rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

906
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,660
often reverse what one did in a what one

907
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,240
changed in in a passphrase that make

908
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,270
sense in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it far enough away</font>

909
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,129
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original sentence markov chains</font>

910
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,560
work pretty well since instruction

911
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,240
alisis doesn't work very well but yeah

912
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,500
these are the types of attacks i think a

913
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,080
reasonable person would apply to pass

914
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,089
phrases at least at the moment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I</font>

915
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,529
just bear that in mind I I should

916
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably go and change some of my past</font>

917
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:08,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">races throwing that in mind I have the</font>

918
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,030
same slide again and yeah so future work

919
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,500
and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is I want to</font>

920
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:16,720
figure out how licenses work so i can

921
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,880
actually um not get arrested if if I

922
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,220
ever want to release this so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

923
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,890
my understanding please break me if I'm

924
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,950
wrong

925
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:28,040
with songs is that the artists owned the

926
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,290
lyrics so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea how lyrics</font>

927
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,509
websites are allowed to exist but the

928
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,550
artists owns all the lyrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the</font>

929
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,690
songs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they make and if you have</font>

930
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,720
that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in breach of</font>

931
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,330
whatever that means um then I want to

932
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,890
figure out how in ltk works so I've no

933
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,110
idea how it works I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fun</font>

934
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing with it my honors project was</font>

935
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,660
actually in natural language programming

936
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,160
or processing but I still couldn't

937
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,960
figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so yeah I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play</font>

938
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,819
without a bit and then automated

939
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,400
passphrase attacks so once I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

940
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,080
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better tool to work with I'd</font>

941
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,970
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bring it to the level where</font>

942
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,810
password attacks currently are we sort

943
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,950
of run password sh and then go do

944
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,170
something else for two weeks while it

945
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:12,080
sort of runs and iteratively cracks all

946
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,770
the passwords so yeah that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

947
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,360
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm just in time yeah so my</font>

948
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter's i'm tired i have like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardly</font>

949
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,410
any followers please follow me it makes

950
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">me feel so happy</font>
