1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,260
yes today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to speak to you</font>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,770
about how to proxy in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> C comes so</font>

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,960
first off a bit about me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I studied</font>

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer engineering attacks so that</font>

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,949
focuses on hardware and software side

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,960
and really enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then did an</font>

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,390
internship at Emily are enjoyed that

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,510
even more and now currently security

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,539
consultant at<font color="#CCCCCC"> mwr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infant security also</font>

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:32,989
on the mobile team so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i enjoy android is</font>

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:36,630
and all the new stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's coming out</font>

12
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:40,949
lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> did some xamarin it's really</font>

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,840
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak about the 4 w's of today so</font>

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,800
firstly the overview that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you just a brief overview of NFC</font>

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,620
and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> wired why did what I did</font>

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">and just a brief</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into interview before</font>

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,319
that and then why it was necessary why I

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,149
at adidas research and what was created

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,429
what's burnt out of this research and

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:12,030
the improvements that still needs to be

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">done to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so yeah during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my talk I</font>

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,530
quite enjoy questions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to</font>

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,510
just feel free throw them we can do them

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:26,030
so i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you have seen this</font>

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:29,159
symbol before it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newer contactless</font>

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,350
payment symbol so basically you just go

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
you take a card and you tap for

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,580
something and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay for it</font>

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,740
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> without even entering a bit</font>

32
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,770
so we can see that this is a very

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,179
convenience driven by medium limitation

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,340
so I convene it in fact that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,600
read an article that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK they are</font>

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,460
actually petitioning contactless

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,570
payments due to the fact that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,570
can't keep track of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font>

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're spending now we can also see</font>

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's quite a relatively new</font>

41
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,920
standard even though the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

42
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,949
actual contact is payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> was done in</font>

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,320
1997 the official communication protocol

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,770
was only ratified in 2008 so that's

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,750
fairly new in protocol standards and we

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,150
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a new physical</font>

47
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication medium for an already</font>

48
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,850
existing communication protocol called

49
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:19,530
EMB

50
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,000
so so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> MV when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends</font>

51
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,830
and family<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are non technical that I</font>

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,570
did a bit of research into MV and

53
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,480
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> surrounds it they like</font>

54
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an electromagnetic something</font>

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,549
I don't know so what it actually is it

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,710
stands<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Europe a most garden visa so</font>

57
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,550
these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies came together in</font>

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:41,250
1994 and they saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was really</font>

59
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,190
no standard way of doing anything in the

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">card payments industry so they came</font>

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,250
together they standardized this

62
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,870
standardized this theory to

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,630
communication protocols they started

64
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,060
implementing security in this and yeah

65
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,329
all made the worlds of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card payment</font>

66
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,980
industry just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better place so later</font>

67
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,110
on we saw some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other well known issues</font>

68
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,239
joining the fray they also started

69
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,610
implementing MV and the products they

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,070
wanted to give their clients this the

71
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,860
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security that EMV provided</font>

72
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:14,280
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> today we see like over 23 got</font>

73
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,490
issues that are part of EMV so MV is

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,010
quite a large project spectrum most of

75
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,630
us know it no of it from the past

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,109
devices where you use it every day in

77
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,200
our bank cards in the ATMs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,390
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also is used in their</font>

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,579
mobile counterparts the mobile pods

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,519
devices and also the newer contact

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,230
response devices so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a couple</font>

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of non-payments places where it's</font>

83
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,540
actually also visible so your<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIM cards</font>

84
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,460
that you use actually also use MV so

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,920
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIM cards you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your cell</font>

86
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,200
phones and also the smart cards that you

87
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,730
use for your digital TV stuff also

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually uses EMV as communication so</font>

89
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,060
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> MV actually we can most of us</font>

90
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,250
know we are developers we know what a

91
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,530
communication protocol is but for just

92
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,060
if there is somebody it's just a system

93
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,700
of rules that allow two entities to

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,430
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other so we can</font>

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,619
basically compare it to Morse code so to

96
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,358
communicate with Morse code you can use

97
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,519
any medium so smoke sound you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can shine</font>

98
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,890
light at each other it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,419
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sent just that the message</font>

100
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent and the format that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dashes</font>

101
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,859
and the dots came through so just like

102
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,139
most MV doesn't rely on

103
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,629
type of medium it's being sent over so

104
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,000
the contactless research that I did is

105
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,979
in essence just the same MV messages the

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,159
same protocol just over different

107
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,919
physical medium so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font>

108
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:48,090
that some of the vulnerabilities that

109
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:50,389
were found in the actual icc part of the

110
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,310
transactions the actual chip and pin is

111
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,870
might also be present in the contactless

112
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:01,860
counterpart so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really see that MV</font>

113
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:06,539
was designed for security in mind as the

114
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,159
protocol is very secure and it is

115
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most complex solution that</font>

116
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,449
has been found yet in the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

117
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">payment card industry so if you just</font>

118
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,580
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that roughly in the 1950s he</font>

119
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:19,710
were issued<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a plastic card with</font>

120
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,120
just the number on it so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

121
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,739
you wouldn't be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,439
because nobody can make their own

123
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,180
plastic cards right so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

124
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,819
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own stuff produced fraud</font>

125
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,190
they then like started obfuscating the

126
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:36,180
data on mag stripes so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac stripes</font>

127
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,639
people also thought this was thoroughly

128
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">Grail because nobody really knows how it</font>

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,250
even works so yeah eventually people

130
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">started figuring out that just by</font>

131
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,699
hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part an old tape recorder you</font>

132
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,610
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like read and write you and</font>

133
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">match it up later so that that was also</font>

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,629
null and void so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> later on went to</font>

135
00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:00,628
micro processors on the chips which then

136
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:02,430
MV then took over<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1994 so we can see</font>

137
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,830
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> envy requires an active component</font>

138
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,830
so that is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that little chip is on</font>

139
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,560
the CAC card it's actually a little

140
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,469
small computer using<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV as the</font>

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,729
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol and it's got</font>

142
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:17,279
different applications on it

143
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:21,029
applications like either your dstv

144
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,729
decoder or your say you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a card</font>

145
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit card or</font>

146
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:29,159
your debit card application so the thing

147
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes this chip and pin actually</font>

148
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,099
secure is the fact that its source

149
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,699
transaction data internally in an

150
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:37,380
encrypted format and it also generates a

151
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,750
unique cryptogram with every transaction

152
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,219
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just adds a bit of randomness to</font>

153
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">every transaction that you doing</font>

154
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:50,759
so moving on when thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> X the</font>

155
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,649
actual MV chips and to attack it these

156
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,449
two ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack it so you can either</font>

157
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:58,080
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on Audrey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layup or you can take</font>

158
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:01,439
it on a software layer so tech MV MV

159
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,020
chip on our dry layer would involve you

160
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,999
to physically decap the chip so this is

161
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">some form</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse engineering we rip</font>

162
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,629
apart the trip and hope you don't hit

163
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:12,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tampering like anti-tampering stuff</font>

164
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,789
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very specialized process</font>

165
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,459
and if you want to do it properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

166
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,279
sometimes he like even require like very

167
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,360
hectic microscopes and stuff to do it so

168
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,889
it requires you to know what you're

169
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,749
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very few people in the world</font>

170
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,569
will actually know how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

171
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:31,139
so direct attacks on this is very costly

172
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">an order to implement so it didn't</font>

173
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">really seem like a feasible attack</font>

174
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,979
posture in the beginning flow it's much

175
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,759
easier to attack MV on the software

176
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,849
layer so as any code is implemented bugs

177
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,579
might arise errors might arise so in

178
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,558
essence the human implementation might

179
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,439
make something insecure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

180
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:56,039
designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be secure so if you think of</font>

181
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,959
a web app as<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EMV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be seen</font>

182
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,119
as the deal is encrypted that is used in

183
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the server can be seen as either</font>

184
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:06,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past device or the DTV decoder or</font>

185
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,969
the ATM or whatever the device is an

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,509
application well can be compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

187
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:14,129
web app so when a website is exploited

188
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,819
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that attackers go</font>

189
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,649
and try and attack the deal is yeah you

190
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,499
sometimes do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not very very</font>

191
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,929
common so the attack is usually go for

192
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:27,209
the low-hanging fruit like attacking the

193
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:30,779
actual application itself so see you

194
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:35,399
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exercise sequel injection all</font>

195
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:37,948
that so that's what we also decided to

196
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,259
do so we could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that researchers</font>

197
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:44,639
actually started focusing on this as

198
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,800
well so in 2010 researchers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cambridge</font>

199
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,309
found a vulnerability that actually

200
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,529
allowed them to complete transactions

201
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:55,689
without authentication so without

202
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,870
entering weapon they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,090
just send back up in accepted command

204
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,320
and the terminal would accept it and

205
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:05,020
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would get the goods or</font>

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,570
money so our research as well found

207
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,819
system level floors in bars devices and

208
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,570
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass devices I'll speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

209
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,760
about that but later in 2014 researchers

210
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,380
at Cambridge again found a pre player

211
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tech which was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the poor</font>

212
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,480
implementation of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> random cryptogram</font>

213
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,460
that was said the same poor infant in

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,970
fact that the randomness was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

215
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:32,200
counter so yeah and then in 2016 this

216
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,270
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON presented that the</font>

217
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,250
actual pulse devices were communicating

218
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,470
with the back in through an unencrypted

219
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,560
channel which is actually quite bad if

220
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,200
you were to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to intercept that so</font>

221
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,439
we also started focusing our research on

222
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,880
that and at em<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our labs we have like</font>

223
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,030
a nice research platform where you

224
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,660
publish<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and you're as part</font>

225
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:59,069
of that we decided also to start licking

226
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,870
at pulse devices and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

227
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,390
by looking at the poster<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine'll in</font>

228
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,310
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that it it has a</font>

229
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,840
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> application running on it so</font>

230
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,800
that's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> issued by the bank or the</font>

231
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,620
retailer it has OS on it just normal so

232
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,459
it's usually it's an ARM arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 or I</font>

233
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,530
think new ones or even arm 11 so that's

234
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,890
just usually a unix-based operating

235
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,720
system so and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the env</font>

236
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,189
kernel that handles the communications

237
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,410
and handle some of the security

238
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocols and then you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

239
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,640
physical medium which you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it as</font>

240
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">an entry point so that's either contact</font>

241
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:41,380
contactless as the EMV but they normal

242
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,720
pulse devices also as USB or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

243
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,720
or depending on what terminal you're

244
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,640
using and what technology is available

245
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,770
so by actually attacking some things

246
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:57,339
through EMV you would physically need to

247
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:02,819
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send something sin that the</font>

248
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,820
pulse device commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes</font>

249
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:20,160
okay yes so yes to actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

250
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,960
send the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> commands you would need</font>

251
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to program something in that</font>

252
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,670
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send the MV command so</font>

253
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:29,430
for that we use the Java card so that's

254
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,459
basically just a reprogrammable chip

255
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,910
card which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use to debug or write</font>

256
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,830
your own applications on so the testing

257
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,560
process involved us actually taking the

258
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,660
card putting it in the device recording

259
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,099
some data altering the data take it out

260
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,069
putting like reading it back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

261
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,810
computer greeting the data altering the

262
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,250
data analyzing the data take it out put

263
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,750
it back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> polish machine take it</font>

264
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,920
out put it in computer take it out put

265
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,210
it in the post machine take it out put

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,699
in the computer so yeah that was a it it

267
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:03,200
worked in the end so we got results from

268
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,460
that so we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things you crash and</font>

269
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,110
eventually got a memory corruption

270
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,440
vulnerability that<font color="#E5E5E5"> later system level</font>

271
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,280
access and then with this system level

272
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,110
axis we actually being there is that we

273
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,209
are we wrote a game for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pause device</font>

274
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,589
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put your card in and then the it</font>

275
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,390
would do the memory corruption

276
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,930
vulnerability and then it would actually

277
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:30,810
program a game in this this one was on a

278
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,209
normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> chip and pin it was a normal</font>

279
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,199
pulse device and it was called<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin pad</font>

280
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,330
racer yeah it was presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a</font>

281
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,000
researcher from us at if Conan I think

282
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:46,890
2012 also the as you see the infection

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,520
in retrieval cards we will also<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

284
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to infect the devices with malware that</font>

285
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,770
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like in the morning would</font>

286
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,630
go you insert<font color="#CCCCCC"> your card he would gather</font>

287
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,579
and harvest all the pins and all that

288
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">max trap data and all the chip data at</font>

289
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,680
ND we take another<font color="#E5E5E5"> card you would</font>

290
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,949
retrieve it and then I press the EF a

291
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,469
lot of pins and core data so this the

292
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,330
second one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you is</font>

293
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,899
something that we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile post</font>

294
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,670
devices these are much newer

295
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,890
yet we found a similar memory corruption

296
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,229
vulnerability and we're able to exploit

297
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,670
it here you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flappy bird flown</font>

298
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:31,890
called chip eben that we wrote yeah it's

299
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:34,920
a was good<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun so that got me</font>

300
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:37,709
wondering to actually if these

301
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,370
vulnerabilities are available on all the

302
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:44,359
interfaces it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be available</font>

303
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,329
on the contact list interface as well so

304
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,570
moving over to the contactors interface

305
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:52,529
first off something that I checked was

306
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,709
actually looking at the cards that

307
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:59,730
enough see that the NFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> cords the data</font>

308
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,339
that it actually has on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when Toronto</font>

309
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">offers got a random batch of cards</font>

310
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:09,720
everything everybody that had NFC card

311
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:12,089
so what I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that some of the</font>

312
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,769
cards actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> displayed ample amounts</font>

313
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,079
of data and other ones were actually

314
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite secure so this led me to believe</font>

315
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an implementation</font>

316
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,300
fault not something it seems to be

317
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">changeable so on some chords yeah that's</font>

318
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually my card so just by tap you can</font>

319
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,240
see my<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss through new transactions you</font>

320
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,790
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see my track to equivalent matchup</font>

321
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,760
data if you can see my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name you can see</font>

322
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,050
the application data from the issuer you

323
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,339
can see the cryptogram is going to be

324
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:51,149
used so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ja quite severe and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

325
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:53,670
by brushing up against me so something

326
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,070
that we saw was that all of the devices

327
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we tasted were actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pci</font>

328
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,589
compliant so here what is beauty

329
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,300
compliance actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its cost the</font>

330
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:04,800
assessments that basically just tells

331
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,959
you if it device is functioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it</font>

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,899
should be in a certain range of criteria

333
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,849
so what it actually does not do is it

334
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,329
does not look at how the device handles

335
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,820
unintended input so all of the devices

336
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we actually found all the</font>

337
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,770
vulnerabilities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> were PCI compliant</font>

338
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:27,850
they had bizarre seeker<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and they</font>

339
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:31,750
were so yeah it doesn't really seems

340
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,089
really mean that much currently so yeah

341
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,660
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future it might mean more but</font>

342
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,279
currently it doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much so</font>

343
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,959
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to actually taste these</font>

344
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,310
vulnerabilities we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start phasing</font>

345
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,250
it so fast dazing the protocol and first

346
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,750
tasting the devices so first tasting is

347
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,730
basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of supplying the</font>

348
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,860
application with large amounts of semi

349
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,009
random data that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not normally</font>

350
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,889
expect so in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> test the large</font>

351
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:03,190
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I explained the</font>

352
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,540
process previously so we retired of

353
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,060
actually removing the cards entering

354
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,000
removing entering so we actually build a

355
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,800
research platform for the contact stuff

356
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,529
so this was our research platform

357
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,959
designed by one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers so this</font>

358
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,230
allowed us to just sniff an altar and

359
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,790
fuzz the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mainly</font>

360
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,680
automatically insert and actually take

361
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,300
out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> card for us so we could just</font>

362
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,029
program a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of test cases that we</font>

363
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted and leave it to do its magic come</font>

364
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:34,899
back off the coffee or lunch and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

365
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,329
would have a crash or similar results so

366
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,699
having looked at how the previous device

367
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,209
works I really saw it was necessary that

368
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">we keep up with the technology and</font>

369
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:48,790
actually still look at this new attack

370
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,019
surface that the newer post devices

371
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:57,130
prevent gives us so it's quite fairly

372
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,959
unknown it is still the communication

373
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:04,179
protocols solve it it's altered very

374
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,889
regularly so we can see that not a lot

375
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,600
of knowledge has gone into this so then

376
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:13,539
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started extending my research on to</font>

377
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:18,849
this so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android so I decided to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

378
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:20,679
at the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> contactless so all of you</font>

379
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,109
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the contactless uses NFC as</font>

380
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:27,030
the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate so i</font>

381
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:32,320
looked at either hardware or software

382
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:34,600
attack vectors and I really wasn't keen

383
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,080
to do six months of Audrey research on

384
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,959
this I just quickly built an app over

385
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,770
the weekend because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we add the full NFC</font>

386
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,460
stack or ad

387
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">err in android so like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we're all</font>

388
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,450
I wanted to do software<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than a</font>

389
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,210
hard way at it's easier to redistribute

390
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,480
as well and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android actually provides</font>

391
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">us extra functionality as well and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,480
ready available<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean anybody anybody</font>

393
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,550
in this room I guess we'd actually have

394
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,160
an energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> reader</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

395
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the phone device and we'd be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

396
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh like look at core data if they really</font>

397
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,630
wanted to so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really reduced my</font>

398
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,060
research time not having to delve into

399
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:21,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the actual hardware side of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

400
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,169
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Android provides a full</font>

401
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,120
stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of energy for us so it's a full</font>

402
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,130
plethora of energy modes that it

403
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,219
actually works with and in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

404
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,400
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device to rule them all</font>

405
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,980
so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that can maybe that</font>

406
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,900
can kiss the cards can this device and

407
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,710
can taste and calm proxy communications

408
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:45,660
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a debate effectively do our</font>

409
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,370
research I developed this contacted by a

410
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,740
contactless research platform to be able

411
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,649
to intercept communications between the

412
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:59,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the both of us due to the fact</font>

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:02,650
that going to Audrey<font color="#E5E5E5"> route or actually</font>

going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the M the M side of those</font>

415
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed a bit difficult and</font>

416
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,330
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would actually waste time</font>

417
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,990
rather than add any wealth to this

418
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,330
research so you're rather wanted to

419
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,680
intercept it via android communication

420
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:23,679
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android platform so to</font>

421
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,900
intercept NFC this this platform would

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,060
allow it<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercept communications</font>

423
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,620
between a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gardener device so meaning you</font>

424
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,500
can emulate the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do whatever</font>

425
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and then send files</font>

426
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,850
data to the card this would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

427
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,530
you to faz device as if you work hard so

428
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,810
fuzzing the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual device itself and</font>

429
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,090
looking at different entry points and it

430
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,889
also like I said allow it to intercept

431
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,720
the communications between an actual

432
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,020
transaction stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going on just</font>

433
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on between</font>

434
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two devices</font>

435
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,230
so just to give you an example of a

436
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,570
normal NFC transaction firstly the

437
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android device we just select</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the PPS II</font>

438
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is basically just telling the card</font>

439
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,600
that hey I'm here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate</font>

440
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,380
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the card within respond with</font>

441
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,850
the application identifier the a ID this

442
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,710
contained the all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications</font>

443
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were currently on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cord so</font>

444
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,580
meaning either the credit card

445
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,280
application or the debit card

446
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,250
application the device within select

447
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,360
application and send the response back

448
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cartridge then respond with</font>

449
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,459
something called the pedal which is the

450
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,520
processing options thought a list and

451
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:42,330
also the gate purchasing options

452
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,160
information this allowed the the device

453
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to understand what is further in the</font>

454
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:52,560
cord so the device then initiates an

455
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,060
application process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the cord</font>

456
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">responds with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the goodies which would be</font>

457
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:00,450
the the unwanted stuff so the tractor

458
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,850
data or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information or the</font>

459
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,210
transaction information and it also

460
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,040
sends the actual file system of the cord

461
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">through which is the application file</font>

462
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,510
location locator so then you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

463
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,150
start requesting increase out of the

464
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,980
application file locator and then it

465
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,080
would give you in even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information</font>

466
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,370
on the card so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would respond and then</font>

467
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,360
you can just basically you until you're

468
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:26,939
done so yeah that's basically what is

469
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:33,179
that so looking at that previous stuff

470
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:35,460
we did that can be done in about 50

471
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,790
lines of code getting all of this

472
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,390
information so basically just receiving

473
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:44,460
an intent from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android application</font>

474
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,690
that an NFC device has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> detected and</font>

475
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,150
then just responding with all the

476
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:53,700
correct information would give you all

477
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:55,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this quite I wouldn't say I wouldn't</font>

478
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,510
want my<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to be floating around which</font>

479
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:03,720
is currently is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific data so</font>

480
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:05,370
yeah it is quite bad so to to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

481
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,150
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the improvements that I could</font>

482
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,820
make some of the stuff that I've noticed

483
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,600
envy is quite sensitive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing i'm</font>

484
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,850
currently busy busy implementing

485
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,679
research done by a security researcher

486
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:24,870
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwc in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> netherlands he really he</font>

487
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,230
looked at the actual proxy side of this

488
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">before where he actually catches the</font>

489
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,570
data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one device so that it</font>

490
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,260
doesn't have to request the device the

491
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:40,850
request makes him any requests for the

492
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,930
the core data from the two devices so

493
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:46,169
another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually wanted to</font>

494
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">do was having having used but before I</font>

495
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what is what I would like in</font>

496
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,310
something that that intercepts and

497
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,439
gadgets information so i would try to

498
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it modular so</font>

499
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,760
Admiral arity and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can</font>

500
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,220
actually add their own code their own

501
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,840
logic and enforces through the data and

502
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,270
whatever they want to do to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fast</font>

503
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,490
better and then also just some general

504
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:10,379
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvements so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw that</font>

505
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,870
it lost performance at certain stages

506
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,270
during the transaction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

507
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,810
basically improving that something that

508
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">also didn't mention was that the actual</font>

509
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:25,409
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android devices I found that the best</font>

510
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">way for them to communicate was over</font>

511
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:32,340
Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH appear so this was easy to</font>

512
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,860
implement it like I said Android gives

513
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,919
us options to do this and it's quite

514
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,020
fast and it's not fast enough for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

515
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,420
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV timings but like I said just</font>

516
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:47,040
implement local cache and I'm going to

517
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and sort that out so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> summary we</font>

518
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,659
can see that there's various NFC

519
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,260
standards that exist we can see that

520
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,020
they are various implementations of EMV

521
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,120
and NFC and these various

522
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,030
implementations of where this can

523
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually be used another use case that I</font>

524
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:10,680
thought of was maybe actually using

525
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:13,320
those two files God readers for access

526
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,930
control and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seeing if I can't</font>

527
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,550
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like the cool CSI plug of</font>

528
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,050
a box going that like runs a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

529
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,529
numbers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually just opens</font>

530
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,500
the door for me

531
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:26,720
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and the last point that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

532
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,049
saw was that Android actually proves a

533
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,630
viable method to proxy new sea calms and

534
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:34,629
yeah that's that's what I got to

535
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,210
[Applause]
