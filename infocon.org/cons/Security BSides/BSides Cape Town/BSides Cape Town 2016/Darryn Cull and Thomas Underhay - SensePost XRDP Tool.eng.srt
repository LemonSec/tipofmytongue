00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:13,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello people so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our tool</font>

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,000
it's called xrdp and its main focus is

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:20,570
on exploiting unauthenticated x11

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,970
sessions so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,539
colleague Darren we both work at<font color="#CCCCCC"> st.</font>

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">spells as security analysts and just a</font>

8
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,390
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about myself so before I was</font>

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,309
doing the security stuff I was a civil

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,070
engineer one day I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in a</font>

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,919
meeting looking around me seeing all

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,559
these old people and I decided well

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,140
that's not me I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a rock star</font>

14
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:53,059
so then I joined st. first okay so

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,920
Darren everyone i joined<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun Space</font>

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">Shuttle diversity studied computer</font>

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,879
science I was originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> planning to</font>

18
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:04,878
become a coder but then I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:10,070
and so much more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I joined</font>

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,930
sensitized as well ok cool so xrdp added

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,770
this thought so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning of this</font>

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,689
year we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> since post-training about</font>

23
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,570
after three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months we got the</font>

24
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:22,460
time to do some research since we were

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,839
both new to the field we didn't really

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what to do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we asked the analyst</font>

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,659
some ideas and the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy Dane is the</font>

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,130
most of all today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they and make some</font>

29
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:41,560
noise you didn't hear anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,390
Dane told us he had this problem on

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,350
assessments<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok basically he got this</font>

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,689
vulnerability and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't really feel</font>

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,179
that exploiting this manually was really

34
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,250
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him so we decided to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take on</font>

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this problem we were really excited</font>

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,719
about this so we got started<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

37
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing if you you might know what X</font>

38
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,548
is but for those who don't I'll simply

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,190
give you a short description basically

40
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,720
if you are using a unique selinux type

41
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,400
of system then you are making use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,730
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is currently in</font>

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11th version so it's called x11</font>

44
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,328
mainly you might note by that name and

45
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it just plays a central role</font>

46
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:32,959
in displaying graphics on your screen it

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,299
originated from MIT we're back in the

48
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">days computers were really expensive so</font>

49
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,310
they had this one main computer and they

50
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,090
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to for students just to</font>

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,890
connect to this computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just share</font>

52
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,659
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources for instance if they want</font>

53
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write a report I can connect to this</font>

54
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,269
machine have like it takes editor

55
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,200
whatever display on data screen and they

56
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:01,099
could do their work ok so looking at the

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,839
basic architecture they on the top left

58
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,548
you can see there's keyboard and mouse

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,280
so that's basically your inputs and the

60
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,810
top right that's the screen that's where

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,030
X will display the windows and here

62
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,579
looking if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

63
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,069
dotted line that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically your local</font>

64
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:22,819
machine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go below the dotted line</font>

65
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:26,238
that can be some remote client<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so X</font>

66
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,879
is basically a mediator between the user

67
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,160
and clients for example a browser on

68
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,638
your machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be X term on a remote</font>

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,040
machine anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

70
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,949
imagine when there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users using</font>

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,090
one resource authentication let's play

72
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:46,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">role somewhere ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

73
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,609
imagine we have our remote server there

74
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:52,668
for the resources on the first method of

75
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:54,799
the authentication is just by host so

76
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,919
the administrator you can type in a

77
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,680
command he says exhales plus and give it

78
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,430
a IP so if you connect from that IP you

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,840
can authenticate ok the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> method is a</font>

80
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:11,359
cookie MIT generated MIT cookie if your

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,620
computer or terminal<font color="#CCCCCC"> wherever usage can</font>

82
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,639
prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

83
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,349
cookie then you can authenticate as well

84
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,470
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> method a little bit more difficult</font>

85
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,840
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the server and the user</font>

86
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,719
both need to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trust in a third</font>

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,229
party machine I through something like

88
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:34,850
Kerberos that's just another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:37,610
Cashin method<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for one other</font>

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,840
method you can commit connect with it's

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:50,330
also authenticated is simply through ssh

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:53,690
so it will update now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what you</font>

93
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,099
do you can just type<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH include the</font>

94
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,170
dash X option the target machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,550
when you connect it you can type X term

96
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,580
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see your little</font>

97
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:08,090
terminal that will actually pop up on

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,240
your local machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's all</font>

99
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,919
good and fine everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is secure</font>

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,840
looking at an unauthenticated station

101
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,260
like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is there's quite a few</font>

102
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,369
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mess this up one of the ways is</font>

103
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:25,390
where the administrator allows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

104
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:29,260
traffic on port<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6000 also you can maybe</font>

105
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:32,090
mistype something or if here is like

106
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,480
just not I'm info struggling with

107
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,969
authentication you can run XO spliced so

108
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:44,810
anyhow on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network can simply just</font>

109
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:47,540
connect to that server okay so the main

110
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,730
problem here or the what we have now is

111
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:56,840
an unauthenticated session we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

112
00:05:49,730 --> 00:06:05,480
hackers what do we love<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay second</font>

113
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:09,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">most we love shells</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so our aim for</font>

114
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,510
this was we needed some other reverse

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:17,210
shell maybe a graphical shell anything

116
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:20,480
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so just one more thing on</font>

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,330
this unauthenticated station the you can

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,030
export your expert display run that

119
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,700
command and that IP will typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

120
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:33,559
the IP of the remote server and at the

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:36,620
end you can just type your command okay

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,890
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our remote server we want to</font>

123
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,690
exploit it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do ok so this</font>

124
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,620
process is not just straightforward

125
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,080
there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tools</font>

126
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,210
can use every tool just give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,080
output you have to chain that into the

128
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,900
another tool and you go forth like that

129
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,469
there's no like fluency throughout the

130
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,710
process so it's really frustrating just

131
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,400
rating<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first two we looked</font>

132
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,580
at was excellent info that you just

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,080
targets display or window on the remote

134
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,889
machine and it displays some information

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:20,609
so looking at the command so it's just X

136
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,979
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> one screen will update now dash</font>

137
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">routes simply says that you want to look</font>

138
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,620
at the root window that will typically

139
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,130
be exactly what the user on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote</font>

140
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,690
machine will see so display that just

141
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,990
says you targeting display 10 dot 213

142
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,910
whatever is running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

143
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,120
another important piece of information

144
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:51,479
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the window ID you need that for some</font>

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the other tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so like we had</font>

146
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,270
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about two remotes a</font>

147
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,849
window we needed some like we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

148
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,700
what's on that a machine can we get any

149
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:07,229
output anything like that so the first

150
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:10,919
tool we came across was xwd it stands

151
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:13,620
for X Window dump so you can run the

152
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,799
command<font color="#CCCCCC"> its xwd dash display that's a</font>

153
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,900
remote display you're targeting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

154
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,020
window again and you put that out to

155
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,510
some file now you can't just read this

156
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,479
file you need to convert it into the say

157
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:30,360
for example the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG and then you can</font>

158
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,900
see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so this process is</font>

159
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,680
not very like this it's very kind of

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,449
blocky you do one thing at a time so we

161
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:44,430
did some more research and we came

162
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,260
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> X watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little</font>

163
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,529
gift this is typically what you'll see

164
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,439
when looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> X watchman so you can</font>

165
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,420
see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that server it</font>

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,240
updates as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible with it's</font>

167
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,569
basically a bunch of screenshots that

168
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:06,149
steichen and they is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you include</font>

169
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,980
include your window ID so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

170
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:11,130
in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what's happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

171
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,040
the remote machine you can just see what

172
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">the user is doing and we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

173
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,860
this further either just a reverse shell

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,839
remote and like a reverse shell or some

175
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:29,490
graphical shell since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do love</font>

176
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:33,149
shells as occurs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing</font>

177
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we looked at was X 22 so what this</font>

178
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,160
enabled us to do is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can send some</font>

179
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands you can for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example open a</font>

180
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,300
terminal you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can open a file browser but</font>

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not it looks easier than it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

182
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,719
because if you say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance you</font>

183
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:55,170
export display and you run your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex 22 if</font>

184
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that type something like X</font>

185
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,939
term in your terminal then your terminal

186
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,209
will actually be displayed on the remote

187
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,550
machine so that's rule one no<font color="#E5E5E5"> backing</font>

188
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:10,649
like never hack yourself that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

189
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:13,199
stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in the second command you</font>

190
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:18,180
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance send a mouse movements</font>

191
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,070
but say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened this second then you</font>

192
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,890
need to find a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select your first</font>

193
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,950
screen types of if you want to just type

194
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,560
like echo other world or whatever then

195
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,020
it's got to be like a character space

196
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,589
character space characters face so it

197
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:37,529
makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole process really tedious</font>

198
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:41,339
so basically we were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a some</font>

199
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:43,890
form to like it a graphical shell remote

200
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,310
shall something very easy to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

201
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,800
that's not frustrating<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I'll give</font>

202
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,149
over to Darren and you'll tell you more

203
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:57,240
about our implementation cool so we know

204
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:59,910
what tools are available and so what we

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,399
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is take those tools and wrap</font>

206
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,860
them up in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice bow so that they all</font>

207
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,070
work together and give us something

208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,250
awesome so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did was we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to</font>

209
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:15,380
write a Python script

210
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:18,440
and we started off by running<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent</font>

211
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,290
info using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python grabbing the window ID</font>

212
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,880
and passing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2x watch win</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> creative</font>

213
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:30,020
creating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> screens that updating gift</font>

214
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,790
that you saw earlier now we had the

215
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,800
output so now we needed to figure out

216
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,829
how to get how to take input from the

217
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,810
user and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the remote machine</font>

218
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,580
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> some research and we'd had to</font>

219
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,390
brainstorm a bit like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font>

220
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this and really finally sort of just</font>

221
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,270
using transparent overlay so creating

222
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,250
another window with that's completely

223
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,770
transparent allowing you to click and

224
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:58,220
with like text inputs and buttons and

225
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:01,400
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all look pretty and so we</font>

226
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,760
looked online how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do this we</font>

227
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,220
decide we found pi gtk and we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

228
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,790
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the main reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that there</font>

229
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,160
was with excellent info x1 and x2 a tool

230
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,849
there's already a lot of dependencies to

231
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,120
this tool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> pi gtk ships with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> python so</font>

232
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,730
we didn't want so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that simplifies the</font>

233
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,560
installation process and whatnot but in

234
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,040
hindsight there was a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea pi</font>

235
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,109
gtk is horrible never use it it like

236
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,480
getting the buttons and oh there was

237
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,330
just making a transparent took us ages

238
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,900
it was it was horrible but we eventually

239
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,780
got it to work and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> PI gtk allows</font>

240
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:45,290
for you takes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user input and then</font>

241
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use X through tool to send those</font>

242
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,360
inputs to the remote machine doing

243
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,939
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some processing like</font>

244
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,360
taking a sentence since splitting it up

245
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,630
into characters and whatnot but once we

246
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,900
had the tool we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided we needed a fast</font>

247
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:07,040
and easy way to find a vulnerable hosts

248
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:09,740
that was that would be fun to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack so we</font>

249
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,969
created an nmap script using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> map</font>

250
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:18,200
scripting engine obviously and they

251
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,510
already exists the x11 access script

252
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,630
that ships default with nmap but all

253
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does is it checks whether</font>

254
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,330
the host is vulnerable to

255
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,920
unauthenticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> x11 which tells you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

256
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,540
it's vulnerable but it doesn't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

257
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,329
a good enough idea of whether it's worth

258
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,750
even looking at and if you come across

259
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,400
like if you come across an internal

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,880
network or something and every box is

261
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,060
vulnerable which one you go for so we

262
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,530
realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are four main options</font>

263
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,219
option one the box is invulnerable

264
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,140
either port the port is closed the port

265
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,170
is open nothing is running or it's

266
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,470
authenticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's not very</font>

267
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,660
interesting or important the second

268
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">option is there's no active display so</font>

269
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:08,980
the the box is running x11<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

270
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:12,819
unauthenticated but it doesn't respond

271
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X commands we only</font>

272
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,500
actually found out about this after

273
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,230
writing the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and writing the script</font>

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,670
and using the script when the script

275
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,750
would keep failing and we were like

276
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:28,780
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so we run x.x win info</font>

277
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,690
against that box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just bombs but</font>

278
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:35,199
according to the but<font color="#E5E5E5"> according to the</font>

279
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,690
output from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the auth check it's</font>

280
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,630
unauthenticated we did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> research</font>

281
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,930
into this and we really still have no

282
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,260
idea why that's why that happens so

283
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,329
that's some further work for us later

284
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,080
the third<font color="#CCCCCC"> option is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's vulnerable but</font>

285
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,930
there's no desktop environment there's

286
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:59,550
no desktop environment so this happens

287
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:02,349
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run an xserve but</font>

288
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,750
without an operating system or anything

289
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,400
like that when you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

290
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back it's literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

291
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,370
black a black image with the default

292
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,859
resolution so that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

293
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,830
interesting either and the final option

294
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:23,170
is jackpot you find a vulnerable box

295
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:27,330
that's the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking for what</font>

296
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:30,490
this the script actually generates a

297
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:33,610
screenshot and saves it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the direct</font>

298
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,050
your directory so you can once you've

299
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,360
run the script you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just look at all</font>

300
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,399
the pic

301
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,740
and the pictures are named nicely with

302
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,269
IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

303
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,589
you oh no this from sections from sex

304
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,860
this one sucks that one let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

305
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:49,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one once we created the scripts it</font>

306
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,089
was time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a test drive</font>

307
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so as you can see this is South</font>

308
00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:00,980
Africa now<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine that you are the two</font>

309
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,319
interns like oh just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish the training</font>

310
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,120
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this opportunity to write a</font>

311
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,820
nice script do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">your main target well this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not our</font>

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">were we thought we going to take over</font>

315
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">like probably the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet with</font>

our<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we got some IPS from</font>

317
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,550
our scanning team and these are the

318
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,000
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just in South Africa we</font>

319
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,310
scanned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 27 million IPS we did that</font>

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,880
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> masks and since we were just</font>

321
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,189
checking for port<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6000 x11 ports and</font>

322
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,130
then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ran it through our in</font>

323
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,680
my script<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so looking at the whole</font>

324
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:50,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">of South Africa we found for vulnerable</font>

325
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,849
hosts now not vulnerable like in every

326
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:56,360
case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could see a desktop we could</font>

327
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:59,329
see only one desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

328
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,220
really pretty disappointing so we

329
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,129
scanned the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> of South Africa found</font>

330
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,720
one desktop environment and we just

331
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that was really just lame so we</font>

332
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,290
also internally like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people see any</font>

333
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:18,049
of these x11 vulnerabilities on Eternals

334
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,990
and they confirmed it they said they are

335
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:26,359
quite not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> common but they do see</font>

336
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,990
them on internals so the soul if it was

337
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:34,969
not in vain<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the conclusion is</font>

338
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,770
that our scanning stop right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

339
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,580
did not scan the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet or</font>

340
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,530
whatever but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this picture</font>

341
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">will always remind us about this whole</font>

342
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,710
exercise this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one guy in South</font>

343
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:52,200
Africa that was vulnerable

344
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,909
okay so Darren will quickly show you a

345
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,190
demo of our two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to speak</font>

with our custom stress

366
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,400
and it produces a screenshot it saves it
