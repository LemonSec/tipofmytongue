1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,639
hi hi besides I have to make the

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,309
customary apology to everyone for being

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk between you and beer so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:21,509
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to make this too long</font>

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,740
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be doing a talk on</font>

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,269
software security but from a perspective

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:31,119
of hardware and so I am a full ta

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:34,210
electrical engineering student and which

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,620
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've yeah I'm more</font>

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,730
interested in getting my hands dirty and

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:45,819
then finding shells fired traditional

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:49,510
path so traditional security and what we

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,150
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with mostly involves a</font>

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">network based attacks against computers</font>

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:01:01,000
or desktop machines or servers x86

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:04,809
hardware I'm broadly speaking obviously

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,049
this required well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you have</font>

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">no physical access to the machine and so</font>

19
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,090
it's looking for vulnerabilities for

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,189
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are open to exploits and</font>

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware name</font>

22
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:22,928
with the screen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keyboard then</font>

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,460
you get this game over and whatever

24
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:27,789
security you had on your hardware you

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:32,649
can consider void and yeah it's earned

26
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:34,899
and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so hardware</font>

27
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,999
extends beyond computers and servers to

28
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:40,780
things like infrastructure so Reuters

29
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:42,850
firewalls switches mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just things</font>

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that connect all the devices that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,749
care about so much together and carry

32
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,079
all of the sensitive important

33
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:54,068
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what are the</font>

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,158
vulnerability is here well on the inside

35
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,200
of most of these is Linux which is

36
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,880
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're quite familiar with now</font>

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,219
what's nice about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware recently and</font>

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,728
more recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of embedded</font>

39
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:12,280
devices are running Linux and well

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,550
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bit overkill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,510
the easiest way to get a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,689
market quickly

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,578
you can take a system it's cheap it's

44
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:23,709
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheapest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickest way to get a</font>

45
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:28,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">product to market is to use something</font>

46
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:30,489
with embedded links so obviously that

47
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,500
extends beyond networking equipment to

48
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,340
things like IP cameras when a storage

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,190
devices and these devices also run<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux</font>

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,849
and are also on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network but are</font>

51
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,709
often disregarded not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

52
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:52,120
corporate environment but in your home

53
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:53,769
for example so getting in let's assume

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all the network services are</font>

55
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,480
perfectly secure and not open to

56
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,220
vulnerabilities which is very seldom the

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,920
case but let's assume that is the case

58
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,680
there is no keyboard or display or any

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,768
obvious human interface to get into the

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,349
device so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> access it how do we</font>

61
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:16,450
exploit it and take advantage so a lot

62
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,089
of hardware devices have a serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font>

63
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,040
which is a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're used to well we</font>

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,389
know from older computers when you know

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,358
used to use a serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> board to connect</font>

66
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:28,810
your mouse or to get a terminal into a

67
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:33,310
switch or something other and often

68
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,829
these terminals expose a shell sometimes

69
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,859
the shell is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unauthenticated sometimes</font>

70
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,970
the shell has root privileges and then

71
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:45,069
you can essentially do whatever you want

72
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually these devices</font>

73
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,250
also have a bootloader which basically

74
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,078
handles the bruising of the whatever

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">firmware is loaded onto the device but</font>

76
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,359
if you stop the bootloader then you can

77
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,799
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device like that and and</font>

78
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:04,780
from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can dump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the firmware</font>

79
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,519
over over the network and once you have

80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,019
the firmware it's essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

81
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,780
taking a hard drive out of the desktop

82
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:14,260
computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then again you have access</font>

83
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,750
and you can do what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want now that</font>

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,969
option is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect directly to the</font>

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,260
devices firmware which again is the

86
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">equivalent of taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard drive out</font>

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,570
and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serial port or the</font>

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,300
boot loaders and<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us I've also</font>

89
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,980
encountered cases where the bootloader

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a generic thing we</font>

91
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,150
allows all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to happen</font>

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,820
over an Ethernet port which the device

93
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,979
doesn't have and so obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

94
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,450
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bootloader is useless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you</font>

95
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,610
can connect directly to the flash chip

96
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,920
with a programmer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can buy from six</font>

97
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,130
dollars in ebay you can again dump the

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,740
whole contents of the firmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

99
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,540
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep you can access the device of</font>

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,240
course this doesn't just mean that you

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,070
have the firmware it means you have the

102
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,380
firmware and you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you</font>

103
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,760
can put it back which opens a whole

104
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,960
bunch of other interesting possibilities

105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,360
and just a disclaimer this is not

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,460
specific to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand but it's</font>

107
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,050
essentially a white label product from

108
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,469
China which is sold under a whole bunch

109
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,720
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brand names and a fellow</font>

110
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,830
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> enthusiast sent me one of these</font>

111
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
cameras and say there's some weird

112
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,849
network traffic but I can't get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

113
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,000
device so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do hard way of</font>

114
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,460
magic and tell me what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so I</font>

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,060
opened up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device it did have a</font>

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:35,320
serial port<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you yeah get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

117
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,500
how to find and the shell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

118
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,070
presented me with was running<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux 2.6</font>

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the shell didn't help me because</font>

120
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,409
there was I didn't have credentials and

121
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,330
and it was turned out later I could find

122
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,400
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't look hard enough sir I</font>

123
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,620
went down other avenues that I was more

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,890
excited to try so what I ended up doing

125
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,320
is stopping it in the bootloader copying

126
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,320
the contents of the entire flash which

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,460
is usually about four eight megabytes

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,340
into the RAM which is usually

129
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,340
considerably bigger and not not much of

130
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,400
it is used at that point and then

131
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,919
transferring it to my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

132
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,409
network port once I done that I had the

133
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,150
firmware image so I decompress<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sent</font>

134
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,170
the same friend the et Cie password an

135
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,270
ett shadow files which he cracked and

136
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,040
then gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the credentials then my</font>

137
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,270
cereal board was useful because I could

138
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,510
log in and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could do whatever I</font>

139
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,919
wanted and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the nice things is he</font>

140
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,500
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the root password but he</font>

141
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,380
did find the admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> password which was</font>

142
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,290
limited in some ways but<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

143
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">booked the permissions and I just</font>

144
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,449
checked which scripts were running and

145
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,580
had started

146
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">matically on boot found the ones that</font>

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">were running as root and because the</font>

148
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,949
permissions were broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could edit</font>

149
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:56,740
these files as admin so I there was some

150
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,300
basic utilities like NC sir i just added

151
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,610
a line that opened a reverse shell to my

152
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,379
machine and restarted the machine and

153
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,669
suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a reverse root shell on</font>

154
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:08,169
my desktop<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of the stuff is I</font>

155
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,008
mean it was nothing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that</font>

156
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,270
allowed me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the camera</font>

157
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,029
assuming there were no credentials there

158
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,740
wasn't really any<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in but</font>

159
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">using some hardware techniques I was</font>

160
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the password and get access</font>

161
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:27,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the device so like I said the things</font>

162
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,050
you can do from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here once you have the</font>

163
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:31,568
firmware you can either extract files

164
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">informations contain the firmware image</font>

165
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:37,930
is obviously the line X firmware and but

166
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:41,830
can also contain user data like Wi-Fi

167
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,029
passwords and other interesting

168
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,669
information depending on what device

169
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,249
you're accessing and you can also modify

170
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,279
the file system so you can add binaries

171
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:52,629
and you can replace the version of busy

172
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,449
box with something else you can add

173
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:58,800
netcat you could add take your route and

174
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,719
add iodine or p title and add

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,399
capabilities to that and you can also

176
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:05,169
boot an entirely different firmware

177
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,289
image most brutal<font color="#CCCCCC"> odors have the option</font>

178
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,479
to boot from tftp or over network so you

179
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,919
could try out completely different

180
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,758
images without actually making any

181
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,830
changes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and and again like</font>

182
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the IP camera you could add a</font>

183
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:27,969
backdoor so have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> open reverse shell</font>

184
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:30,669
to a specific IP if it exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so why</font>

185
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,860
are we doing this one of the reasons

186
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,649
obviously is research in security and

187
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,620
investigating devices and learning and

188
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,149
I've learned a lot of stuff indirectly

189
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,339
from doing these things not just so much

190
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:44,198
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

191
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that I go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find this</font>

192
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:48,699
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also adding adding</font>

193
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,199
functionality like I said adding

194
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,519
different boundaries to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter to make</font>

195
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,290
it do other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not</font>

196
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,920
supposed to changing the purpose

197
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,560
entirely which I've also done<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

198
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,959
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for fun if it's</font>

199
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:08,680
something that makes you excited and on

200
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:10,510
so there's a blog by a car mableton

201
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,479
guy's name is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's Chris but I</font>

202
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,279
could be wrong and he is an embedded

203
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,620
security expert some of you may

204
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,709
recognize this website this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a list of</font>

205
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:28,779
some blog post titles that he has so

206
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:32,260
there was in May 2014 hacking the DSP w

207
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:34,870
2 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 smart plug the next blog post</font>

208
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,040
was hacking it again the person after

209
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,829
that was hacking it again again what if

210
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,839
I again again again I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he stopped</font>

211
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:45,939
with that after that then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this</font>

212
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,000
one which was a newer model<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

213
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,190
much later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> crutches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> followed shortly</font>

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,060
after when they fixed the problem that

215
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:59,170
he used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack it was followed by this</font>

216
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,180
post because for the most part vendors

217
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,170
don't seem to care that much about

218
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,130
security on embedded hardware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

219
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,110
sometimes feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough people</font>

220
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">are looking at it but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

221
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,860
gaping holes and in some of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font>

222
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,000
of the time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even yeah it's over</font>

223
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's using traditional</font>

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,589
techniques to find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and what</font>

225
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,050
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guide tends to do is tear the</font>

226
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,940
firmware apart and investigate what

227
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">causes evolving road season why it's a</font>

228
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,190
problem and he grows quite deep into it

229
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,000
and disassembles binaries and does

230
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:38,560
exciting things like that this was

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,230
something I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm in light of well</font>

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,209
with the intention of changing the

233
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,910
purpose completely that is called a

234
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,619
seagate duck star and it's a device

235
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,180
that's used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nath storage so you put</font>

236
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,790
your hard drive your seagate hard drive

237
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,699
in it where that logic analyzer is not

238
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,399
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be and it provides access to</font>

239
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,170
your data over the cloud and but you

240
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,029
know it's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own data and you have the</font>

241
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,550
storage locally so also over your

242
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,529
network it wasn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great product and</font>

243
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,240
kind of failed commercially and sellers

244
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,439
supplier started selling it at a loss

245
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,639
but it runs debian

246
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,550
so once it's running debian it's

247
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,100
essentially an errand box raspberry pi

248
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,979
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and with gigabit ethernet</font>

249
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,079
which is quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> attractive for a bunch of</font>

250
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and i ended up using it with a</font>

251
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,969
logic analyzer for doing some other

252
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is completely not what this</font>

253
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is for and at the moment it's running a</font>

254
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,630
media server and a web server and a

255
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,920
proxy and something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else which it</font>

256
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,470
handles quite well but it was never

257
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,939
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used for that and again</font>

258
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's playing with bootloader thanks</font>

259
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:48,389
different firmware images another very

260
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:51,609
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

261
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:54,100
essentially a USB device when it

262
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,010
enumerates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host controller asks it</font>

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,889
for its USB descriptors so what she did

264
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:04,660
was ask assets words used be descriptors

265
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:07,180
but ask for a ridiculous amounts of well

266
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,920
a huge size response which it didn't

267
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,000
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it was carted properly so</font>

268
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,660
this wasn't a Wacom tablet so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,570
hardware techniques called glitching

270
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:26,620
basically got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guts cycle precise</font>

271
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:29,380
control and glitch the power so that

272
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,480
this process amidst an instructional

273
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,790
something along those lines and

274
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,620
basically didn't validate and the

275
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,750
request and ended up splitting the

276
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,730
entire contents<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the flash memory out</font>

277
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,699
in response to a request for a device to

278
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,860
scripture so they managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

279
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:48,219
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware off this chip by asking</font>

280
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and telling it to tell you</font>

281
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,810
just keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking like go on so</font>

282
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,760
obviously the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of increments in</font>

283
00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:00,699
memory until you have the entire image

284
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:02,380
and so we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here and this is</font>

285
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:06,069
made me do some crazy things like get

286
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:09,430
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it's not exciting</font>

287
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:13,120
at face value because you can share a

288
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,739
Wi-Fi hotspot and share storage and and

289
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,920
it's got a battery in it but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font>

290
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,100
it as is a small platform device running

291
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,889
Linux with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> battery a USB port and an</font>

292
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,199
SD card slot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wireless radio</font>

293
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,290
which if I can run some generic version

294
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,209
of Linux and I can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into all</font>

295
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:36,309
kinds of things it can be a tour box it

296
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:38,579
can be a download or literally anything

297
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:42,069
that you can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Linux toolchain</font>

298
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:43,959
run on a limited platform like that so

299
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:46,269
it's made me start doing things like

300
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,258
picking up pieces of hardware like this

301
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,249
and trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do something</font>

302
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,600
entirely different and what's nice is if

303
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:54,759
you're able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

304
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,889
firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly you can brick it</font>

305
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,319
completely and you can just write it

306
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:03,999
back again so I have broken this

307
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:06,099
irreparably at least twice I have so

308
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:09,369
yeah that's what it's ended up making me

309
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,269
do and yeah so that's just a small

310
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:16,600
window into what I do and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets me</font>

311
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,459
excited and yeah my taken security from

312
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,660
hardware perspective but<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

313
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,660
perspective but
