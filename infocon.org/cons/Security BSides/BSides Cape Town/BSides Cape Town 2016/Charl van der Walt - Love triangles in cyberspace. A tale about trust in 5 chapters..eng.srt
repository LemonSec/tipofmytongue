3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,179
love triangles in cyberspace it's a

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit different to the kind of</font>

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,099
stuff that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have seen up to now</font>

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,919
because I'm it's not a technical

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,829
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to I want to offer</font>

8
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:28,619
some commentary on some of the kind of

9
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:30,809
broader sort of geo political movements

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,189
we've been we've been watching in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

11
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,830
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,170
particularly over the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months to</font>

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,129
fill you in a little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,150
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been happening and</font>

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,330
then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of try and bring it back to</font>

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">our space and offer some commentary</font>

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,989
often some thoughts on how I think it

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">will affect our our industry and what it</font>

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,850
potentially means for us these are kind

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,260
of new there fresh ideas I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font>

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,030
preaching a gospel but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I'd</font>

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,890
gonna plant some seeds with you that

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,280
that you may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with a</font>

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,780
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in your own minds I recognize</font>

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,129
this is the first presentation after

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,600
lunch which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like graveyard shift and</font>

27
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,150
and and I'm worried because I don't I

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,149
don't have any calc<font color="#CCCCCC"> II xes to show you</font>

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,400
but but I have compensated with the

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,530
three three ingredients for any classic

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
presentation which is I have a lolcat so

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,150
you'll be glad to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,200
reference to Edward Snowden and I have a

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,190
picture of Vladimir Putin riding a beer

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,460
so you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to look forward</font>

36
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,770
to oh that wasn't supposed to happen at

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,210
all that's not a good that's not a good

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,658
sort let's see we go from there we go

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,908
today yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> aha there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go this is</font>

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,860
Donald J Trump November the ninth this

41
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,840
year he was elected the 44th President

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,960
of the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States of America by the</font>

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,150
great people of the USA and I don't know

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,880
how it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you guys but for me and</font>

45
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,060
my family we were generally taken aback

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,439
like we were we were shocked um my wife

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,930
was more than shocked she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like just</font>

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,529
made you she was she was upset by it you

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,640
know she's really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shaken um not</font>

50
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">only but I think would have meant for</font>

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,549
the world and for geopolitics and for

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,470
our country and for this you know the

53
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,519
state of the human race<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also because</font>

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,348
we've kind of been led to believe

55
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,599
something completely different right the

56
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,340
exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> polls in the states had suggested</font>

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,500
that Clinton was going to win some were

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,150
even saying by a landslide

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sort of language they were they were</font>

60
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,290
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we watched the numbers</font>

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter in was watching TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the morning</font>

62
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,609
it became very apparent this guy's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

63
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna win and so immediately afterwards</font>

64
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,130
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all the analysts and the press</font>

65
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,420
and everyone jumped into this massive

66
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,030
discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how did that</font>

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,950
happen how did we get it so wrong and a

68
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,750
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different theories were</font>

69
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,489
floated this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working hard</font>

70
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,860
supposed to number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> theories</font>

71
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,660
were floated about how it could have

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,610
happened and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another you</font>

73
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,930
know Trump was better tapped into the

74
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,670
American electorate he understood them

75
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,610
better he read them better others were

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,750
saying the Clintons followers didn't

77
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,520
rock up they didn't pitch they were

78
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,410
complacent they were apathetic they

79
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,989
thought they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bag didn't</font>

80
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">rock up on the day and and Trump stole</font>

81
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,120
it some<font color="#CCCCCC"> was saying look is this is a</font>

82
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,130
this is a gender issue but Americans

83
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,450
aren't ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a female president they</font>

84
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,519
just couldn't stomach last minute I

85
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,670
chickened out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's other you know</font>

86
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,650
snide comments about Trump's hey and in

87
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,290
some people in the last few weeks

88
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">started saying something about the</font>

89
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,590
Russians is this theory that got floated

90
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,170
that said we think Russian hackers swung

91
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,940
the election in favour of Trump and at

92
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,280
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounded like noise but</font>

93
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,190
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got to the point that some</font>

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,890
actually very respected computer

95
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">scientists and data scientists had a</font>

96
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,630
meeting with Clinton to say look you've

97
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,360
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lobby for a recount in some</font>

98
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:49,560
counties because the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing are anomalous the variation from</font>

100
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,120
what the polls suggested in counties

101
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,670
where there are electronic voting

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,500
machines is significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> different from</font>

103
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,040
the variation in counties where there's

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,140
not electronic voting machines and so

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,269
and and and so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deduce that these</font>

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,548
electronic voting machines played a role

107
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,090
is there a significant variable in the

108
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,350
in the differences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing and</font>

109
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,690
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these machines could have been</font>

110
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,769
hacked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not a ridiculous to</font>

111
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,418
think that the machines could have been

112
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,640
hacked because machines like us have

113
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,710
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> proven over and over again to be</font>

114
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,190
you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be vulnerable was it you</font>

115
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,580
doing the kiosk stuff just the other day

116
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,400
okay

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,710
he's not confessing but anyone who's

118
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,849
anyone is kind of confronted you know

119
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,770
these these sort of standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> lame</font>

120
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:39,120
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> atms kiosks will know there's</font>

121
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,969
lots of vulnerabilities in them and also

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,370
the American people are very willing and

123
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:46,020
very keen to believe that Russian that

124
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,000
Trump has an association<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

125
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,188
Russians the Russians favor Trump

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,569
somehow Putin and Trump I don't know

127
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they connect their the</font>

128
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,930
lack of the same mind and and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

129
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,969
the Russians<font color="#CCCCCC"> have got a history of</font>

130
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,259
messing around with with elections<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

131
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,629
come back to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but</font>

132
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,379
when we saw them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgia we saw them</font>

133
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:10,080
most recently in in Ukraine and we saw

134
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,569
the missing in the American electoral

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,770
system so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a woman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called debbie</font>

Wasserman Schultz you might not

137
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,889
recognize her which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite a big deal</font>

138
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,569
she was between 2011 and 2016 the

the party leaders and she'd risen

143
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,849
through American politics and taken

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,979
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this very important it's not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and part of what those emails revealed</font>

152
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,659
were that she and some of her

153
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,490

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:06,750
was very shameful for her and as a

169
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,599
pretty and ambiguous that the Russians

170
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,789
were all over the DNC and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems</font>

he said he said as far as they can tell

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,010
the link and change your password so so

241
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,910
he did and now his emails of all

242
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">overlooked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WikiLeaks and he knows he's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">why it was hat this is what happened the</font>

245
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,620
Russians went in it was the Russians and

<font color="#E5E5E5">they went in because they wanted Trump</font>

247
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,860
to when that's that's the theory endless

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,130
this theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very popular in American</font>

249
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,380
in American politics at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

250
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,720
the theory is the the the the Russians

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,790
are messing with elections American

252
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,950

253
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,420
Clintons were giving us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for it</font>

254
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:56,190
and we've seen precedent for it back in

255
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,260
2014 you guys will remember there was an

256
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,390
election in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Ukraine it was the sort</font>

257
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of election that sparked off what</font>

258
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,220
eventually became the Russian annexation

259
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,050
of Crimea which we'll come back to in a

260
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:12,089
bit oh nothing happened nothing happened

261
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,310
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened there you go so there</font>

262
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:18,180
was a selection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the Ukraine</font>

see on the on the TV showing that these

thirty-seven percent the actual result

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,020
virus was removed so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

290
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,370
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of conspiracies very</font>

291
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,980
happening there and and and Americans

292
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,450
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe that Trump has a</font>

connection to these Russian hackers

294
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,790
because of this guy his name is John

Manfred he was Trump's campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> adviser</font>

up to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> halfway through the campaign</font>

297
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,740
and I don't know if you guys remember he

298
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,330
had to resign at some point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump</font>

299
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">bought a new guy and the reason he had</font>

300
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,440
to resign is because the American public

301
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,120
became aware that he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the</font>

302
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,370
campaign<font color="#E5E5E5"> adviser of this Ukrainian</font>

305
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,440
the annexation of Crimea so he's all

306
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,390
tied in via this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukrainian president</font>

like like this anyway so all of these

313
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,810
factors together the fact that the

314
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,490

the Russians are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnc the fact</font>

that the Russians<font color="#E5E5E5"> have missed around in</font>

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,790
systems before including by hacking

election systems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Ukraine gets too</font>

some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have noticed so she won</font>

322
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,770
like three percent of the vote or

323
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:24,110
something she put up her she<font color="#E5E5E5"> kicked up a</font>

325
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,680
too uncertain everyone's feeling

326
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,650
uncomfortable weird like who's too much

327
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,120
noise let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's recount and she raised</font>

328
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,160
some money and actually right now

329
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,390
there's a recount is he happening in

330
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,829
some of those counties where these

331
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,710
electoral these electronic voting

332
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,300
systems were we used and there's a lot

333
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,810
of drama around that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't have</font>

334
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,089
time to to bore you with the bottom line

335
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,579
from all of this is there's this message

messing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Trump and</font>

339
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,580
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very popular message popular</font>

340
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,860
enough to have driven a recount and

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,230
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> count</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this state but there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are also some sound of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minds and in some</font>

343
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,770
of these quotes you're going to see some

344
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,449
names that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we recognize Dave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i tole run</font>

345
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,610
the company called immunity in the

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">States there they're a big deal in terms</font>

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of technical security is also ex-nsa and</font>

348
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,940
he's like you know actually when I look

349
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,470
at this stuff what I see is what what we

350
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,390
would do we would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we</font>

351
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,580
can own

352
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,170
it then we collect everything we can

353
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,520
gobble it all up and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take it</font>

354
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">home we like or what do we do with this</font>

355
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,829
right so so that so this notion of like

356
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,719
intent the notion of like tactical

357
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,430
intent that the Russians went after the

358
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">dnc so they could leak the emails so</font>

359
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,089
that they can discredit trap<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clinton in</font>

360
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,150
favor of Trump it's like maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

361
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,070
exactly how he he has experienced it and

362
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,079
then some other commentators are saying

363
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNC is not the only</font>

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,190
guys like fell to this the Republicans

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,140
have fallen to it the republican

366

national convention has also been a

367
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,330
victim there's a lot of this stuff going

372
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,210
I'll in our game he went so far as to

373
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,819
say look the only thing that stands out

374
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,740
about the DNC is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they got</font>

found he reckons look basically everyone

article that I was telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about and</font>

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,439
you read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the the Hayden</font>

380
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,910

381
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,130
what the Russians did with the DNC is

382
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,329
not particularly remarkable we're all

383
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,189
doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

384
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,170
right they're all in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and we're</font>

385
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,690
all on their stuff what is remarkable

386
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">though is that what they chose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

387
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the emails is to publish them they</font>

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,939
chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to publish the emails and that's</font>

389
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,210
something he calls covert influence

390
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,800
which is unusual it's not traditional

391
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,340
routine espionage which is what we're

392
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing to each other stuff all the time</font>

393
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,580
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit different</font>

394
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,950
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the thing that's making the</font>

395
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,290
American so uncomfortable it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font>

396
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,710
again in a bit anyway so all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

397
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,939
adds up to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of Vladimir Putin</font>

398
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:09,910
riding the way because we deliver on our

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:38,410
occupation of Crimea and it's

433
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,748
politically quite a remarkable event

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,509
that they will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just screwed by screaming</font>

450
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,029
louder than everyone else the Russians

451
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,609
developed this narrative about what's

going on which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the one hand like</font>

arguing and checking their facts you

457
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,350
know that you heal people who might<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

a post truth world that the Russians are

the masters of of post truth they kept

460
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,929
so much noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the present in the</font>

rhetoric about

about Crimea that it basically paralyzed

until the occupation was complete now

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,019
it's done fait accompli and nobody moved

467
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,210
no no one was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything and it</font>

468
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:07,029
turns out that that's the way the

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,980
Russians role in America when you talk

470

about like cyber and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like you</font>

00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,909
they're talking about is people hacking

474
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,699
computers Russians have got a completely

475
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,899
different view on it what what they talk

476
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,720
about is something called network

477
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:24,639
warfare or information warfare which

478
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,259
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sounds like the same thing but</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russians means something</font>

480
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,279
completely different it's all about

481
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,769
operations of influence it's about

482
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing the way your people and your</font>

maintain control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the information</font>

better fit battlefield and it's

486
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,999
literally by injecting sufficient noise

487
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,789
into the system at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> times that nobody</font>

what's going on and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a method</font>

490
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,879
that the Russians have have have

researched and they talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you</font>

know it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deal for them and all</font>

they've applied cyber to it so for

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">example and they will employ armies like</font>

literally hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter trolls to</font>

is they know who the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter trolls are</font>

506
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:27,369
and we still have to figure it out right

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,428
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you faced with all this like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why are</font>

who's not telling the truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they do</font>

511

it to keep their population under

518
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,939
is they said no no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening</font>

519
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,789
in premier is it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nazi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Revolution the</font>

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,340
Nazis are taking over Crimea and since

521
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:59,049
2014 until now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what the</font>

522
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,209
Russian press is talking about in Crimea

523
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,500
they'll say this is naughty

524
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,510
rising and we had to do is the good

525
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Russian people was to step in and save

526
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,140
the crimeans from from these Nazis so

527
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,190
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually we're very</font>

528
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,620
we're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with fear</font>

529
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,660
uncertainty and doubt it to me our

530
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,360
industry knows quite well and the

531
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,950
Russians use it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know with with</font>

532
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,409
greater with greater fit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> effecting</font>

533
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,060
their political goals so how does that

534
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">tie back to what's happening around the</font>

535
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,460
elections and all the noise about the

536
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,060
DNC well the cloud strife guys

537
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,370
eventually nailed it and the point is

538
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,899
the Russians probably did<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacked the DNC</font>

539
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably hacked a whole lot of</font>

540
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people but they intent is not to</font>

541
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,760
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gain votes specifically for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

542
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,820

543
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to create noise and uncertainty in</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> faith that the American system have</font>

547
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,030
we're seeing happening now and I don't

548
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the Russians particularly mind</font>

549
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,090
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton or whether it's</font>

550
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,159
Trump I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very hard to</font>

551
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,250
predict where the one candidate would be

552
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,740
more or less favorable to your political

553
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,460
goals but the uncertainty<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

554
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,630
create is is presents them with it with

555
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,980
a great advantage and that's kind of

556
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:19,440
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russians are about so so why</font>

557
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,310
are we why do we care about I didn't

558
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">even tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya is going to put a picture</font>

the bonus ya la everyone's gay anyone

562
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,700
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to backtrack a little bit to the</font>

563
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,680
story of the DNC because shortly after

the hack against the DNC that happened

574
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,199
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dramatic announcement they</font>

575
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,770
announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were about to leak a</font>

576
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,720
set a whole cache of hacking tools from

577
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,780
the NSA's technical access operations

578
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,270
group of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of elite bad air skies of</font>

579
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA shadow brokers reckon that they</font>

580
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,690
had done

581
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,980
of these guys tools including<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day</font>

582
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,250
exploits and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to release</font>

583
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,710
them onto the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market and it was a it was</font>

584
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big deal not just geopolitically but</font>

585
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,630
also technically because the exploits

586
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,330
affected a whole lot of perimeter

587
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,970
security appliances<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 net was in there</font>

588
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco was in there and juniper was</font>

589
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,170
in there some like weird Chinese

590
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,680
firewall hood like top top secure or

591
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,240
something was in there and and from the

592
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,890
little bit of the cash that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did</font>

593
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,980
release because they released a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

594
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,300
small part of the cash as a teaser it

595
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,040
was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was apparent that they had</font>

596
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,570
zero-day vulnerabilities and they had

597
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,520
weaponized experts for the zero-day

598
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,570
vulnerabilities and as a result of these

599
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,760
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> was suddenly running around like</font>

600
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,770
we got a patch now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> affecting us</font>

601
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,510
these these exploits are affecting us

602
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,050
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those vulnerabilities dated back</font>

603
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,970
to 2012 so since 2012 the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

604
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">running and running around with you know</font>

605
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,900
ways to own up your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls your</font>

606
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,290
perimeter firewalls we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

607
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,530
it these guys somehow knew about it so a

608
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,240
lot of theories as to as to where those

609
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,160
exploits came from and one of them were

610
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,750
one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it's like some NSA</font>

611
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,330
contractor kind of like a Snowden type

612
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,560
story this NSA contractor he had the

613
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,139
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's been like carrying it out</font>

614
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:33,000
in his underpants you know one bite at a

615
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,350
time and and eventually nice girl and

616
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,930
then they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been like lying in his boot</font>

617
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and since been driving after them but</font>

618
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's another theory in the theory</font>

619
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the the shadow brokers put forward</font>

620
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,240
this was their argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the</font>

621
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">story starts with the crowd called the</font>

622
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,290
equation group who some of you might

623
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,470
remember as the guys who wrote Stuxnet

624
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:56,790
and lhota later flame they like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead</font>

625
00:23:52,470 --> 00:24:00,150
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the big gorillas in</font>

626
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer hacking space and and what</font>

627
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:06,360
shadow brokers were saying is that

628
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,469
equation group had a staging server jump

629
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,419
box somewhere on the internet that they

630
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,680
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using to launch a text from so what</font>

631
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,820
happens they earn up this box somewhere

632
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,680
in the internet and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> drag their</font>

633
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool kits across onto that box evals</font>

634
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">pentest as you've all done it drag your</font>

635
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,160
your your tools on to that box you

636
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,360
launch your attack from there do

637
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,220
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and</font>

638
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,229
then you reverse out again why can you

639
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,669
take all your<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff with you except</font>

640
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,380
according to shadow brokers they didn't

641
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,980
reverse out they left some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

642
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,309
stuff lying on that box and and somebody

643
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,500
found it the the shadow broker is found

644
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,690
it and that's how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be got to be</font>

645
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,650
leet so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit it's a little</font>

646
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit if you think about it like your kid</font>

647
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,280
you know walking home from school and

648
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like finding a limpet mine lying on the</font>

649
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,980
side of the road<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's somebody like</font>

650
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,389
left there from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozambican war is</font>

651
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,740
like I look my when I found you know

652
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,750
these guys had sort of been throwing

653
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,510
really big bombs at each other and and

654
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,740
one of them just forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pack one away</font>

655
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,809
and these guys found it and they've let

656
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,640
go look now we've got it and what they

657
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,309
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it was really interesting they</font>

658
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,710
they offered to auction it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> released</font>

659
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:09,480
this this little preview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

660
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">had which proved that the exploits were</font>

661
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,919
real and that the vulnerabilities were

662
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,540
real I caused a lot of us to be running

663
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">around patching stuff and then they had</font>

664
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,678
this much bigger cash which they were

665
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,080
offering<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish in exchange for like</font>

666
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten Bitcoin or something which I don't</font>

667
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if they ever got they didn't and</font>

668
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
and of course now there's a lot of

669
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,570
there's a lot of drama around then

670
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,010
everyone's talking about like who and

671
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,049
what and why and who are these guys

672
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really and this is where Snowden comes</font>

673
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,900
in Snowden came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the theory which</font>

674
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,390
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that I liked which is</font>

675
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,230
that really who the shadow brokers were

676
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:48,360
is Russian government acting on behalf

677
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,400
of the Russian government and what they

678
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,590
were doing is sending a warning signal

679
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,480
to the American government about

680
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,480
pointing fingers effectively the

681
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,080
messages look guys yes we hacked the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnc</font>

682
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,210
yes you caught us yes bad us but let's

683
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,129
be honest we're all doing it to each

684
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,100
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're going to make a big</font>

685
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">noise about it by you know attributing</font>

686
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,030
the hack to us we can also make a noise

687
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,490
big noise about it and here's an example

688
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,690
of the kind of thing that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

689
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,250
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you guys and your</font>

690
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,570
capability and what you've been up to

691
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,309
including the fact that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

692
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,370
sitting on these zero-day

693
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:26,340
vulnerabilities for like what five years

694
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so so what's happening is</font>

695
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,780
really a game is like international

696
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">intrigue in which the hackers are really</font>

697
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,070
just players right but the point isn't

698
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,870
the hacking the point is some political

699
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,810
objective and the hackers are just like

700
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,750
a part of

701
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,889
and and maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the part that we</font>

702
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,530
would intuitively imagine they would

703
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">play the point about it for us is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

704
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,160
at some point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is happening</font>

705
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the internet and involving</font>

706
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,780
technologies that we work with every day

707
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,629
at the some point it leaks it leaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

708
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,889
and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point it starts to it starts</font>

709
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,600
to affect us not just in terms of

710
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,850
politics and world affairs but

711
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,260
technically people like Ellen I think

712
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,149
you were affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this are now</font>

713
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,820
spending the weekend you know patching

714
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,750
their 14 it's because of what the

715
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,550
Russians did to the NSA did to the you

716
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,260
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who cyber but quit all</font>

717
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these guys and it's now spilling over</font>

772
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,590
guys do is they come to places like this

829
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,640
see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is this cycle of what what I</font>

830
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:57,919
call industrialization where political

agendas drive professionalization like

832
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,120
we want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people's phones so we</font>

833
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,070
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find smart guys smart hackers to</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us get onto people's phones on</font>

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,860
to their computers went to the networks

836
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,299
or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you want to do so</font>

837
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">they find smart guys those smart guy</font>

838
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:15,320
says look we need exploits so so they go

839
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,139
and that creates a market with crowds

840
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:23,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so rhodium and who these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> French</font>

841
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,770
guys whooping thank you whooping we go

<font color="#E5E5E5">for cool will either right or will buy</font>

843
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,580
what source these will sources exploits

844
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,490
and a creator it creates an entire

845
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,260
industry like an industrial military

846
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,539
complex with his connections between

847
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,340
private industries and government that

848
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,750
are creating these tools training these

849
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,199
people and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what's really</font>

850
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:44,750
important also<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving people exposure to</font>

851
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,700
a kind of hacking and a taste for

852
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:50,570
success that I think we've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

853
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,919
before so like I through the pen testers

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to cost me you'd say to him buddy</font>

859
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,960
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen you know hit</font>

860
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,610
him on the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take his iphone 6</font>

861
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,380
may be but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna not gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

862
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,250
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we just like when a remotely</font>

863
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">only his iphone iphone 6 and but someone</font>

864
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,669
somewhere in the UAE had a conversation

865
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,149
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone in Israel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

866
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:21,739
yeah maybe we could try and they've

867
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,748
probably done it right they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

868
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:25,609
run that remote to exploit against

869
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:27,980
against an iphone and they've probably

870
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:29,600
got a back channel and they've probably

871
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,429
dropped their malware on that on that

872
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,988
phone so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that guy is</font>

873
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem like you know</font>

874
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,679
can you get on this phone or can you own

875
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:38,210
that or would you dare to do this you

876
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,100
know those guys have got a completely

877
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">different mindsets due to what we have</font>

878
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
does it make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like the whole</font>

879
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:48,949
sense of the art of the possible has

880
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,840
changed um and and and and what that

881
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,570
does this is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad picture that I</font>

882
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,178
drew by hand maybe doesn't make much

883
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,580
make makes sense but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have this</font>

884
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:00,139
theory that that what happens is is for

885
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,359
us that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the normal guys doing</font>

886
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:03,979
you know cyber cyber security what

887
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:06,559
happens is we we look at the landscape

888
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,030
and we and we watch threats emerge we

889
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,199
watch risks imagery like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh here's the</font>

890
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,260
thing that's coming or there's a thing

891
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd better start</font>

892
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,049
preparing for that thing and we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

893
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,010
understand the threat a bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

894
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:17,719
as we understand the threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

895
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,270
better we can defend ourselves prepare

896
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,918
ourselves a bit better and in the

897
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,389
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the threat is unknown to</font>

898
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,589
us that's over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a god</font>

899
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,929
my hype cycle kind of thing that's

900
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:28,489
happening when Phil is unknown to us so

901
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,899
we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this blue line the threat is</font>

902
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,339
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective like we can't really</font>

903
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,020
defend ourselves against<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we don't</font>

904
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:35,389
understand it it's unknown the tools the

905
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,159
techniques but eventually our knowledge

906
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the threat kind of grows to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

907
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,389
where we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok actually we get that</font>

908
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,220
thing we know how to respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and</font>

909
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:45,470
we can start to mitigate the threat and

910
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,408
then over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the impact of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

911
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:49,939
on our environments reduces until some

912
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,480
point where it reaches some kind of

913
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:55,849
acceptable acceptable level right the

914
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,680
problem is of if governments are running

915
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:00,470
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and creating an entire market for</font>

916
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,480
things like like<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero days and and and</font>

917
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a completely different and kind of</font>

918
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,079
precedent at art of the possible then we

919
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">never reached that point we never reach</font>

920
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,900
this tipping points we don't know what

921
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">our think we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to defend</font>

922
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves against it never been in the</font>

923
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:15,920
ring with someone who's actually chained

924
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,569
30 days to own an iOS machines one

925
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,839
experience we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how to</font>

926
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:23,450
mitigate and so that so the entire kind

927
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,400
of balance of powers is shifted by these

928
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">government shenanigans I don't actually</font>

929
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with us but</font>

930
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,510
but they have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> real impact on us</font>

931
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,870
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a theory that our our</font>

932
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:39,030
industry is sort of silently but but

933
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:42,720
quite tangibly being almost completely

934
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,970
inverted by what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in</font>

935
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,680
geopolitics by what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with I</font>

936
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,299
don't call it cyber war because I don't

937
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's quite cyber war but so the</font>

938
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">government driven cyber operations is</font>

939
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,840
completely changing the rules all around

940
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,410
us and we just we just haven't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

941
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,360
picked picked up on it yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

942
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a I think that's a very scary</font>

943
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,390
thing and it and it leaves us with the

944
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,950
question of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well where does</font>

945
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this all go now how does this actually</font>

946
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,910
play out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys are playing in</font>

947
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,040
with a completely different set of rules

948
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,569
completely different budgets completely

949
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,670
different sense of the possible

950
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,320
completely different levels of human

951
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,860
resources you know where they're hiring

952
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,210
thousands and thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people and</font>

953
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,470
training them to be hackers with a I

954
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,090
don't know if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed the</font>

955
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,410
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the British government just</font>

956
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,580
turned out what is it called Bletchley

957
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,509
Park how does it pronounced laterally

958
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,250
late lately they just they've just

959
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,680
turned it into a school for like savant

960
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,360
kids like they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take like 13</font>

961
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,740
year olds out of high school and put

962
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:45,090
them in this iconic historical monument

963
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,100
to 22 computer hacking and teach them to

964
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,720
be hackers like from high school look

965
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,720
how do we deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how do we know</font>

966
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,120
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that means for us and I</font>

967
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,939
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen is we're</font>

968
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see two kinds of kinds of</font>

969
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,270
operators emerging before I say anything

970
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,780
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apologize to this guy on</font>

971
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:05,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left on the right because he's</font>

972
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,220
actually much skinnier in real life<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

973
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,540
I had to add to shape the picture to get

974
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,069
it to fit nicely into the boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he</font>

975
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,360
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out looking a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit like he</font>

976
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,380
hasn't trained for a while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he trains</font>

977
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,990
every day that's like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

978
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,700
pudgy face like then so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

979
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,600
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of two kinds</font>

980
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:26,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of orientation the one orientation the</font>

981
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,410
boring guy on that side is it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

982
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">be insurance oriented it's going to be</font>

983
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:33,470
it's going to be it's going to be

984
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,790
focused around risk management

985
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively by ensuring for residual</font>

986
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,380
risk and the reasoning<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

987
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,420
look we can't we as a normal civilian

988
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,130
business a mom and topshop mom and pop

989
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,470
drop with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know an e-commerce site</font>

990
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,339
and some guys using Windows 10 and you

991
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,680
know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other guys using</font>

992
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android and a pause and all of these</font>

993
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've seen getting owned up</font>

994
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,380
all the time we can't realistically

995
00:37:53,670 --> 00:38:00,839
expect to defend ourselves against the

996
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,940
shadow brokers and the and the equation

997
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,160
groups of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this of this world it's not a</font>

998
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,480
fair contest we're not paying so what

999
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,270
we're going to do is we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1000
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,640
what's reasonable what may be best

1001
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,020
practice calls for we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put</font>

1002
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,220
those things in place kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

1003
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,369
would do with the business on the high

1004
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,379
street and anything else that happens

1005
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,380
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I call off my</font>

1006
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,119
broken say they owned me again how do i

1007
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,410
claim and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to offset</font>

1008
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,680
and for businesses i actually think

1009
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,598
that's not an that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a it's a</font>

1010
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,569
familiar route to take you've got a

1011
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,180
certain amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rescue you you cover</font>

1012
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,349
your residual using insurance and and

1013
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,490
management and leadership in the

1014
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:40,530
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of know what they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1015
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:43,200
for and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry too much</font>

1016
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,030
about all the likes lima that that's so

1017
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,980
scary and unpredictable that's the one

1018
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,930
route I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are other businesses</font>

1019
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,180
and organizations for whom that won't be

1020
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,460
an option that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say look we can't</font>

1021
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,640
insure against the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threats that</font>

1022
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,710
we face the compromise would be

1023
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,819
unsurvivable for us or the consequences

1024
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:04,200
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> would would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be unacceptable and I</font>

1025
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:06,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">think basically those guys are going to</font>

1026
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,759
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> badass and they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1027
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:10,319
badass using the spillover from this

1028
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,940
industrial military complex because

1029
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:13,589
what's going to happen is guys with

1030
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,569
being taken into the NSA and into cyber

1031
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:17,190
command and into the FBI now we've just

1032
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:18,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> large-scale mandate to</font>

1033
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,069
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any hack anything that</font>

1034
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,540
they want those<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are going to spend</font>

1035
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">four years there eight years or 12 years</font>

1036
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,940
or 20 years and then they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1037
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,680
leave and they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join a</font>

1038
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,270
consulting company and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1039
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring all those connections all of those</font>

1040
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,960
tools all of that experience like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

1041
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've gotten from</font>

1042
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,440
actual if you like cyber combat

1043
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,150
operations they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it</font>

1044
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,680
back into the private sector and if

1045
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,480
you've really got something that you

1046
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,859
think I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing</font>

1047
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,390
hacked what you're going to end up doing

1048
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:44,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">is calling a group like that and saying</font>

1049
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,509
hey how do we deal with it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

1050
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:47,520
will be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we know those</font>

1051
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,260
Russians and we know those Ukrainians we

1052
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,720
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Chinese operate will sort</font>

1053
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,970
them out for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it may not work in</font>

1054
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,020
ways that we're familiar with

1055
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,759
and you're kind of seeing that already

1056
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,220
right so NSO group they're all

1057
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,859
ex-israeli signals intelligence it's

1058
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,390
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a standard mo for this</font>

1059
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,710
route for Israelis you go to the army if

1060
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,450
you're really smart you going to signals

1061
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,160
intelligence they teach you side but you

1062
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,890
leave and you start up a cyber company

1063
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,779
and was those guys that changed the 30

1064
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,759
days together now in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case there</font>

1065
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's offensive operations but I think</font>

1066
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,960
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar things happening in</font>

1067
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,280
defensive operations on the other side

1068
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,480
of the fence we're seeing similar things

1069
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,520
we're seeing the insurance thing

1070
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,130
happening also this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy called</font>

1071
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,099
ed / mult very curiously the funny guy

1072
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,609
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's a he's a he's an American</font>

1073
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:34,170
politician from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7th zone in Colorado</font>

1074
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,630
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> my don't understand American politics</font>

1075
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,780
works but he's forwarded this boy he's

1076
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:42,270
proposed a bull in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> states that that</font>

1077
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,730
effectively suggests that American

1078
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,240
companies who comply with the set of

1079
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:49,740
standards laid down by the NIS t by NIST

1080
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,209
will receive a discount on cyber

1081
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,799
insurance so what you do is you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1082
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,060
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say okay look</font>

1083
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've done these 10 things that you said</font>

1084
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,810
we should do so I'm you know reasonable

1085
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:59,580
man I've kind of done everything you can

1086
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,580
expect me<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business to do I</font>

1087
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,839
need cover for my residual risk and the

1088
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,029
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say cool will subsidize</font>

1089
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,920
that cover go and buy it from these go

1090
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,830
and bite from these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 companies that we</font>

1091
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,930
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> support so the offering of</font>

1092
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:15,330
fifteen percent tax credit against cyber

1093
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,279
insurance provided that provided that

1094
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,259
you comply and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course the cyber</font>

1095
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,609
insurance market is loving it<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1096
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:26,640
predicted to triple by 2020 and reach

1097
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,720
like market size of 7.5 billion dollars

1098
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,490
I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1099
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,680
money or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean like we're literally</font>

1100
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,109
speaking but it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of all</font>

1101
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,279
right so those two those two models

1102
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,000
already starting to present themselves

1103
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,320
and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of just to wrap it</font>

1104
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,700
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more that can be said</font>

1105
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,260
on the subject but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have so</font>

1106
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,060
much time to wrap it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1107
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,369
sort of seeing ourselves at a bit of a

1108
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,320
at a bit of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> split in the road</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

1109
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:50,790
think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start seeing</font>

1110
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,280
players emerging on both sides of this

1111
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,589
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> split i think in the meantime</font>

1112
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,780
there's a lot of stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still to</font>

1113
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:59,099
be done here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i imagine for those of</font>

1114
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,720
us operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this space we're going</font>

1115
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,690
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> our legs getting like wider and</font>

1116
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,950
wider and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wider apart as we kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of have</font>

1117
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide which route it is that we want</font>

1118
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take and that's</font>

1119
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:18,110
that's me thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

1120
