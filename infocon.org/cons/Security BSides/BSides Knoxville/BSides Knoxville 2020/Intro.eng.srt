24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,900
do so we kept the date and and we kept

25
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,820
the speakers and and we even kept some

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,500
sponsors everybody was really supportive

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,500
so we appreciate that thank you

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,869
electronic

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,669
badges another thing that we're missing

30
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,040
posters some people have asked if we're

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,520
gonna mail out posters now we might

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,180

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,929
special coded 19 poster as well as 20 21

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,850
poster we don't know at this point but

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,860
yeah we're not doing any physical stuff

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,809
this year you know it was enough for us

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,170
to try and tackle a virtual conference

38
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,429
for the first time we didn't I was weary

39
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:07,350
of tacking on too much extra stuff so

40
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:11,670
keeping it fairly simple and yeah

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,140
photography videography you know it's

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,030
gonna use the same same great people

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,609
we've got some great photos on Flickr if

44
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,630
you search on Flickr from previous years

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,190
if you want to see what the fiscal

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,480
conference looks like I know a lot of

47
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,519
folks are going to be tuning in that

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,119
aren't in Knoxville and have never been

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,010
to the fiscal conference I'd urge you to

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,730
consider coming to the fiscal conference

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,769
next year it's it's usually it's like

52
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,238
this and it's not raining we'll see you

53
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,430
know we can't we can't guarantee that

54
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:44,620
but usually we get pretty nice weather

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,079
and and a lot of people turn out so

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,540
thanks to our sponsors both new and old

57
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,940
tech systems has been with us every

58
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,790
single year including with this virtual

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,220
conference lb MC is a new sponsor we've

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,459
got a lot of good friends over at lb MC

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,549
and we appreciate them coming through

62
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:07,090
for us and Clayton Homes as well I came

63
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,760
in as a as a platinum sponsor and big

64
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,410
things there for them coming through and

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,880
we kind of had a realization this year

66
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,730
you know we realized that there's

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,549
probably more value for sponsors for

68
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,459
folks looking to hire security people

69
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:24,549
and specifically in this area in East

70
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,890
Tennessee then maybe vendors you know we

71
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,190
not sure vendors get a whole lot of

72
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,470
leads out of it but it was a thing that

73
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,150
we tried out this year and it seemed to

74
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,329
resonate with folks and and we'll

75
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,190
probably go for that next year as well

76
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,109
we also have some community community

77
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,980
sponsors we've got ascension which is

78
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,080
joke

79
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,980
thing you'll learn a little bit more

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,760
about that later he's doing some hosted

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:55,060
training and the big draw still there

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,739
the the North tree is his his logo there

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm assuming that's what that's supposed

84
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:03,910
to be Joe and DC 865 is is running one

85
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,170

being a jerk anything like that either

107
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,169
let an organizer know in discord you can

108
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,000

the hashtag if you're going to tweet

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,969
anything about it we like to keep it

116
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,330
short and sweet this is the same format

117
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:40,750
we've used since year one just be sk4

118
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:43,180
besides Knoxville 2020 there's

119
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,690
systems there and I think that was yeah

120
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,280
2016 the only year we didn't do a an

121
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,010
electronic badge I thought it would be

122
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,599
really cool to do floppies and I was

123
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,370
going to put stuff on the floppies and

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,080
everybody assumed there was gonna be

125
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,760
like a secret challenge and the floppies

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,190
and I just didn't have time for it and I

127
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,530
I let everybody down but they were color

128
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:07,420
coded vendors were green that was a fun

129
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,539
year and yeah short video from

130
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,310
TEKsystems I did have some animations

131
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,660

132
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,890
need to get moving on here

133
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:23,260
but had a bunch more photos but that's

134
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:25,990
that's alright you probably can't hear

135
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,680
the the audio but it's it's just music

136
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:39,130
that's cool I can beatbox it if you want

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:42,090
it's very rhythmic it's nice it's a nice

138
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,890

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,349
you I promise to keep you shorts I know

166
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,630
we've got a nine o'clock you know start

167
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,430
time here but I just wanted to go over

168
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,820
some of the details that we are hosting

169
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:45,250
the CTF the secure coding tournament on

170
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,020
the security warrior Tech's Channel

171
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,980
so it is open from 8:30 to 4:30 and

172
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,529
highly recommend when you have an

173
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,529
opportunity to go in there and try to

174
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:59,230
compete and win some prizes just to give

175
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,760
you an idea who's secure code word is we

176
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,399
are a global application security

177
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,880
company and our vision is to empower

178
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:10,570
developers to become the first line of

179
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,550
defense by making security highly

180
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,649
visible and providing them with the

181
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,029
necessary school skills and tools to

182
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:20,640
write secure code from the beginning

183
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,689
what we developed was a cloud-based

184
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,810
training platform

185
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,730
for developers it was designed by

186
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,800
developers to really help developers

187
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,660
secure their code from the start and

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,060
ultimately where we are customers

189
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,009
organizations use this is to help them

190
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,839
achieve faster more secure product

191
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,819
development it's helping developers

192
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,779
become more security conscious so

193
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,639
they're able to defend their own

194
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,129
applications and I think one of the

195
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,500
biggest keys that we're doing we're

196
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,240
basically bridging the gap between

197
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,339
security and development creating a

198
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,800
positive security culture within

199
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,600
organizations and what we have done

200
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,240
we're changing the paradigm from

201
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,709
traditional learning to hands-on so

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,300
where you think of the traditional is

203
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,779
more around me learning and classroom

204
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,300
instruction which is great but when it

205
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,769
comes to learning how to secure code we

206
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,019
found their retention rates are very low

207
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,819
over a period of time where as something

208
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,879
when you're practiced by doing we see a

209
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:18,370
much higher rate of retention I equate

210
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,269
this very similar to things you learn

211
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,370
growing up remember you know working my

212
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,379
dad teaching me how to work on cars or

213
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,560
doing small projects in 20 years later I

214
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,240
still remember how to do those things so

215
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,018
very similar to with the secure code

216
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,939
more current code warrior approach where

217
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,069
we fit in the the software development

218
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:40,899
life cycle where there's a lot of stuff

219
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,389
out there is trying to shift left where

220
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:47,019
we actually start left we want to be the

221
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:49,029
the starter for developers to learn how

222
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,009
to securely code we're not here to

223
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:54,009
replace existing tools we're here to

224
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:56,019
make them even better the goal is at the

225
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,689
end of the day is that developers are

226
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,029
learning not not putting in the same

227
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:04,180
types of vulnerabilities into their code

228
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,949
and for the organization itself the cost

229
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,319
of fixing security bugs will start to

230
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:13,229
drop over time we have a full slew of

231
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,430
features in our training platform

232
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,240
everything from tournaments learning

233
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,638
training and assessment everybody that

234
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,699
signs up for the tournament will get

235
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,439
access to the platform and we're going

236
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:28,569
to be keeping it open for another two

237
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:30,880
weeks after the tournament so feel free

238
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,290
to go in there but the majority of the

239
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,600
time you're going to be spending is in

240
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,150
the training and learning this is really

241
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,130
building and maintaining skill

242
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,900
and then what you're going to be doing

243
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,480
in the tournament here is where we're

244
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,650
going to have that fun competition where

245
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,340
you're going to compete against others

246
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:52,240
to to earn points just going to show you

247
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,450
a quick example what it looks like from

248
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,420
a four what a challenge when you go into

249
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:05,620
the platform so I'm just going to work

250
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:07,990
on a an ejection category here so

251
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,790
typically where you're with with our

252
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,190
challenges and you'll find this in the

253
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:17,050
tournament itself you're going to be

254
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,510
tasked to either locate or identify and

255
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,209
fix vulnerabilities we have over 35

256
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,069
languages for the tournament itself I

257
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,930
think we have about 20 or so languages

258
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,210
you can choose from but just remember

259
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,650
just that once you choose one language

260
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,360
in the tournament that's the language

261
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,770
you're going to be playing in so in this

262
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,520
particular example here I'm actually

263
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:40,150
working in c-sharp net webforms and in

264
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,480
the goal here is I need to locate a

265
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,220
particular vulnerability in it's an

266
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,920
injection flaw and this particular

267
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,970
vulnerability is an email objection

268
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,560
you're going to be asked to maybe

269
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,200
potentially find one vulnerable code

270
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,439
block or you may be able to find two

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,480
cold blocks so what you're going to do

272
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,450
is basically go here and I'm going to

273
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,900
highlight museu like yellow triangles as

274
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,370
you can see one code block popped up and

275
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,610
I will need to go and find another one

276
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,970
so you know the idea is to go through

277
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,640
this particular code snippet and

278
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,340
identify where that potential these

279
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,860
potential vulnerabilities but no worries

280
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,900
if you're new to secure coding you're

281
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,390
trying to learn that's part of the the

282
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,449
fun of what we provide so we do provide

283
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:31,960
a hint system here it will ask you to

284
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,280
give you a hint typically the first hint

285
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,870
that hit the first hint in the

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,959
tournament is free and I highly

287
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,300
recommend everybody looking at it we

288
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,620
will provide a small video that comes

289
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,150
with it so will tell you a little bit

290
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,310
about the vulnerability and then provide

291
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,340
you a video as well so it'll help with

292
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,349
your learning process so it is it is a

293
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,750
free free hint

294
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,759
and I highly recommend using it other

295
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,850
hints I will show you in the scoring

296
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,380
here could cost you some points but

297
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,060
definitely take it but this typically

298
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,620
that's the process is that you're going

299
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,750
to be going through these challenges

300
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,839
there is a walk through once you first

301
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,160
go into the into the into the tournament

302
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,500
so it'll help you kind of walk you

303
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,939
through the process let's go back here

304
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,940
to my tournament details

305
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,370
alright so tournament details as I

306
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:27,490
mentioned we have about 20 or so

307
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:30,100
languages you can choose from and we

308
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,589
have about 36 total challenges that's

309
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,029
going to take you if you go through all

310
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,560
the challenges we'll take you somewhere

311
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:37,029
probably about an hour and a half two

312
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,189
hours complete now you got the whole day

313
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:42,339
and I know there's a ton of talks today

314
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,149
so you know you can you can go in go out

315
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,800
when when you can there's a there's a

316
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,139
number of quests that you can compete in

317
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,109
there's actually eight different levels

318
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,389
you can start at any level level one is

319
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,230
going to be much more easier level eight

320
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:59,050
it's going to be a little bit more

321
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,550
difficult as you get there but you do

322
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,699
score points for more difficult

323
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,079
questions all the challenges will

324
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:06,910
require you to identify a particular

325
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,638
vulnerability within a block of code

326
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,529
you'll be taught you'll be asked to

327
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,940
locate a name vulnerability and there

328
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:17,110
also be tasked to fix the vulnerability

329
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,420
a piece of code scoring the way it works

330
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,329
is you're going to earn points typically

331
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,010
for easy points is around 100 medium is

332
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,199
about 200 I don't think I would have me

333
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,209
maybe I have one or two hard in there

334
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,939
but that you get the most points from

335
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,699
that you do have about three attempts

336
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,290
per challenge so the first time you go

337
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,810
through it you get a hundred percent of

338
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,790
that total points there as you start to

339
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,979
do another attempt in the third attempt

340
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:47,410
you start to get less less points from

341
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:50,290
that as I mentioned there is a please do

342
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,120
use the the first hint it is actually

343
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,949
free as you start to do work with other

344
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,920
hints to help you walk you through the

345
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:04,510
problem you will get points taken away

346
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,510
so feel free to use that first hint

347
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:10,240
you do have until 4:30 today we are

348
