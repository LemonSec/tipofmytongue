next we have Robin wild it's 3:00 a.m.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,559
do you know where your backups are Robin

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:18,609
I'm going to hand over control to you

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:20,789
now thank you you're welcome there you

6
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,789

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,470
delighted to make a connection with you

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,930
and talk offline about this subject that

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,200
I am so passionate about I'd like to go

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,790
ahead and get started my session is it's

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,880
3:00 a.m. do you know where your backup

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,690
is I know that sounds like a pretty

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,240
pedantic question for this day and age

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:36,050
but I want to talk to you about why

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,089
backups are important it used to be back

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,830
in the day that backups were only

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,310
important for things like application

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,560
failure or power outages or things of

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,270
that nature that seemed to happen much

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,470
more frequently back in the day than

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,340
they do now as a result many of our

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,679
businesses have become kind of

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,750
complacent about their backups or

38
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:59,450
there's an assumption that what they're

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:05,259
backing up is efficient which may or may

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:10,098
not be true also we've become a much

41
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:11,240
more aware of our need for disaster

42
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,130
recovery and business continuity

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,730
especially in light of the current

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:21,530
pandemic some people were more prepared

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:24,290
for everyone to go off-site and be ready

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,620
to do business continuity remotely some

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,739
were not and now that subject has become

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,320
much more in the

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,620
in the talk these days than it was

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,780
obviously prior to the pandemic but the

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,240
most important reason especially for

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,930
this audience is ransomware ransomware

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,240
has really become the predominant reason

54
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,390
for beyond just the health and hygiene

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,070
of systems for backups to become an

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,500
important part of it part of your

57
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,359
information security strategy a new

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,440
organization will fall victim to

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,320
ransomware every 14 seconds in 2019 and

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,300
that's expected to go down to every 11

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:14,420
seconds by 2021 ransomware attacks

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:18,080
typically are done via phishing emails

63
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,290
and fish me which is a major source of

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,840
data in this area said that phishing

65
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,049
emails increased 109 percent that

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,310
delivered ransomware packages in 20 in

67
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:33,830
2019 ransomware attacks themselves have

68
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,590
increased 97 percent in the last two

69
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,200
years it's become a very profitable

70
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,870
business and one of the top three

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,060
vectors for cyber security attacks in

72
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,040
the United States that all being said 34

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,410
percent of businesses hit with this type

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,870
of malware took a week or more to regain

75
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,400
access to their data of course this

76
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,600
doesn't include whether or not they paid

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,730
for it or not and so there is a cost for

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,280
not being prepared for a ransomware

79
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,019
event it's not to say that backups are a

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,460
hundred percent bulletproof I'm not

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,810
gonna lie to this audience that knows a

82
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,830
whole lot better than I do

83
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,230
that all backups are not bulletproof

84
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,210
however having a backup and following

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,659
best practices is a whole lot better

86
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,599
than having no backup at all in these

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,000
situations so you're going to protect

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,480
yourself much better from any kind of

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,610
application failure any kind of business

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,100
continuity or disaster recovery incident

91
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,700
and of course you're going to also get

92
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,030
the benefit of at least a decent amount

93
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,760
of protection from ransomware in an

94
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,479
acceptable talking discussion with your

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,800
business owner

96
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:53,058
about where recovery time for them makes

97
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,879
sense so let's talk about how you get

98
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:57,409
this done a lot of people a lot of

99
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,789
businesses are going to go out and

100
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,069
they're gonna hire some kind of

101
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:03,589
consulting firm to do a business impact

102
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,409
analysis on their enterprise

103
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:08,900
but some people can't afford that

104
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:10,219
they're just not big enough for it or

105
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,580
they just don't want to come out of

106
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:16,998
pocket for that this is really not that

107
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,909
hard you can get it done and I'm gonna

108
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:22,150
give you a really basic five-step action

109
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,349
plan that'll take you through

110
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,599
identifying and defining the priority

111
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,639
and scope of an app creating a back-up

112
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:31,128
plan and building best practices into

113
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,620
that plan based on this and I soccer

114
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,409
recommendations testing that plan

115
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,779
monitoring the plan and then finally and

116
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:44,180
most importantly developing and as and

117
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:47,389
practicing a routine recovery validation

118
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,029
of your plan and that's a that's a key

119
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,789
piece of your security program whether

120
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:54,529
you're following new CSF or you're

121
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,419
following ISO or anything else it's

122
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,909
important for you to practice that

123
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:02,089
routine recovery validation that not

124
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,979
only are you able to back those files up

125
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,889
but you're able to recover in the time

126
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:10,310
you say you can to a to a business

127
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,709
client and you you are able to restore

128
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,289
to the point promised so that's really

129
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,939
important as we move forward so let's go

130
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,818
over each one of these steps in a little

131
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:22,639
bit more detail and again you would want

132
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:25,039
to do this on each system that you deem

133
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,649
critical so let's talk about that

134
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,469
what are critical applications a lot of

135
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:32,449
people think my app is special every app

136
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:37,419
is a special snowflake and it needs to

137
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:41,209
be backed up may or may not be true but

138
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,279
what does aisaka think which is a great

139
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,589
governing body here in the United States

140
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,719
that helps with risk management

141
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:50,060
particularly IT operational risk

142
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:53,269
management how do they define critical

143
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,360
applications it's really important for

144
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:57,860
you to understand what from a business

145
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,689
risk standpoint

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,520
should be considered critical and this

147
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,050
is helpful when talking with business

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,659
owners because every business owner

149
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,960
thinks their app is special right so

150
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:11,419
what makes it critical downtown of these

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,150
applications even for a few seconds

152
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:17,840
could result in serious financial loss

153
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:20,599
legal loss customer dissatisfaction or

154
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,210
loss of productivity if you are

155
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:27,289
dependent on a system that is processing

156
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,969
for example invoices that are bringing

157
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,240
revenue into your company on a

158
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,550
minute-by-minute basis that is really

159
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,699
important and that does make that system

160
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:41,090
critical because these applications have

161
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,919
access to high sensitivity data breaches

162
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,619
to them could result in a total halt of

163
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,650
organizational service high risk data

164
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,909
exposure severe legal and financial loss

165
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:55,400
and complete loss of customer trust and

166
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,800
brand value work for to employers here

167
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,169
in town that fit most of this second

168
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,909
bullet is criteria they have pH I public

169
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,750
protected health healthcare information

170
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:12,159
PII personally identifiable information

171
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:17,349
in large measure therefore they are

172
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:21,560
exposed to legal in financial loss by

173
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,870
breach to those data populations so the

174
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,409
data categorization very important

175
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,289
around criticality compliance stringency

176
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,838
is generally very high so if you're not

177
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,360
sure but you know hey I get socks

178
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,990
audited on this every year probably

179
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,440
useful to you as an indicator that this

180
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,899
is a critical application other things

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,120
enterprise applications a business

182
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,490
applications and clients specific lines

183
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,140
of business applications that are prime

184
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,260
categories for critical business

185
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,019
operations on a day to day basis whether

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,240
or not they might be considered critical

187
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,920
as someone else is irrelevant if they're

188
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,990
critical to your business your

189
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,390
enterprise how you conduct business on a

190
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,730
day to day basis and they impact your

191
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,220
revenue stream your reputation or your

192
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,529
finances definitely we're going to

193
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,339
qualify is a

194
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:17,199
critical application I also would highly

195
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,240
recommend within your critical

196
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,998
applications for you to take a step

197
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,569
further if you're doing this as a more

198
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,249
holistic approach on more than one app

199
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:30,279
that you identify what are those things

200
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:32,490
that are the crown jewels of your

201
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,470
organization that you want to make sure

202
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,370
that you take the utmost care and

203
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:42,730
caution with identify those make sure

204
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,600
that you do those first so let's talk

205
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,029
about that exact thing priority how do

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,360
you manage priority in the priority

207
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,189
discussion with business owners again

208
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,050
every business owner thinks that their

209
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:58,120
app is the most important happen that's

210
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,170
important to them and we understand that

211
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,180
but as a business we have to define or

212
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,248
help them define and manage the risk

213
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,059
posture for the company is information

214
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:13,689
security professionals so what priority

215
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:18,819
factors or criteria can you use to help

216
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:21,939
the business owner frame the actual risk

217
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:25,930
or the on the the business risk outside

218
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:29,019
of their perception within the posture

219
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,628
of the business as a whole obviously

220
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,339
financial things that bring in money

221
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:36,240
anything that's part of your revenue

222
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,100
stream should be considered a priority

223
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,910
anything that's compliance oriented that

224
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,399
might get you in a litigation or in a

225
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,579
situation where you would be prohibited

226
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,529
to continued business in a space until

227
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:54,878
it was remediated would cost you money

228
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,980
in other words should be considered data

229
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,470
categorization should be considered as

230
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,929
priority as a part of your written

231
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,600
information security plan you should

232
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:08,470
have a data categorization policy and a

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,679
data strategy that every system adheres

234
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,350
to or at least has a categorization

235
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,319
within larger asset management practice

236
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:21,279
that allows you to say these pieces of

237
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,390
data are these groups of data across the

238
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,100
company our mission

239
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,250
critical right there their business

240
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:35,090
critical they're confidential

241
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:38,060
they are business sensitive any one of

242
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,390
those types of categorizations that you

243
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,040
think would be an impact a priority

244
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,640
versus something for example that would

245
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,010
be public facing that kind of data data

246
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,590
categorization might be important to the

247
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,530
web team they care about what their

248
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,750
website does but that is public facing

249
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,990
data and backing it up is not my first

250
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,110
priority backing up my financial systems

251
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:06,190
however would be and then finally

252
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,980
upstream choice sources of record or

253
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:13,220
master data components this is where

254
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:17,420
ransomware can get very insidious if it

255
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,350
can infect something upstream that has

256
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,360
many integrations downstream and I'll

257
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:30,370
give you a for example in many places

258
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,530
here and in the United States especially

259
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,140
that are Microsoft shops and they use

260
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:39,050
Active Directory for example that's fed

261
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,960
from a source of record upstream usually

262
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,650
a human resource system that says that

263
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,620
someone is active or inactive if you can

264
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:52,360
get your hands in that and manipulate it

265
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:55,850
that becomes a very disruptive factor

266
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,730
very very quickly if you can't get your

267
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,950
hands around it so upstream sources of

268
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,560
record and master data components that

269
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:09,410
feed things like enterprise data systems

270
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,469
as well as enterprise reporting those

271
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,300
things can do a lot of damage and it

272
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,329
could be high-value targets for

273
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,209
ransomware

274
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,729
and then finally in your BIA one two

275
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,910
three is your scope and requirements

276
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,459
checklist so I'm gonna move to the next

277
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,139
slide in and I've intentionally kept

278
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,540
this separate so that you can just print

279
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,629
this slide out and help you walk through

280
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,459
this discussion with a business owner

281
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:38,889
but before I do that I want to take a

282
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:41,589
quick second to look at this priority

283
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:45,040
sample I talked with a friend offline

284
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:48,399
who has a consulting business and kind

285
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,639
of took my checklist for a test run and

286
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,179
we talked about what were the things in

287
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,509
his business that he felt kind of what

288
00:13:55,179 --> 00:14:00,929
were the priorities this person does IT

289
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,949
consulting if that's helpful for you

290
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:06,519
obviously

291
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:09,549
they outsource their their payroll

292
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,799
services but they do the injury

293
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:14,350
themselves to save money so that's a

294
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,389
QuickBooks file that's very important to

295
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,739
them especially for invoicing reasons

296
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,459
they want to make sure that they don't

297
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:23,579
have a disruption to their income flow

298
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:27,309
so they they listed that as number one

299
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:29,618
and then work product files that they

300
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:34,169
have spent an enormous amount of time on

301
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:36,519
for clients was number two email was

302
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:39,730
surprisingly number three - this

303
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,379
individual client relationship

304
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,290
management on business development

305
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,899
records that they kept about those

306
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,599
clients leads things they got from

307
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:52,179
conferences etc those things were all

308
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,429
important in developing business in

309
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:57,189
keeping the money rolling in to their

310
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:59,589
consulting business client contracts

311
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:03,069
personnel files and employment contracts

312
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:05,829
and then administrative and then finally

313
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:09,160
their public facing information such as

314
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:12,069
social media and websites so that was

315
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,499
this clients take on priority you'll

316
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,868
notice it started with finance and kind

317
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:19,720
of worked its three through its way

318
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:21,519
through sensitive activities one of the

319
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,939
things that we did tease out as a part

320
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,690
of this is I'm talking about retention

321
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:33,079
or modality

322
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:35,850
of backups so for the QuickBooks backup

323
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,630
it was easily something they could

324
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,820
backup to disk and it not be a problem

325
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,730
so you don't have to go through a lot of

326
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,610
time and money to do something you can't

327
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,750
pick a modality that works well for this

328
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,570
business 15 year retention according to

329
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,220
the IRS was sufficient they haven't been

330
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,890
in business that long so right now

331
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,800
they're keeping all six years that they

332
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:04,140
have available and then when it comes to

333
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,030
email they went with a much shorter

334
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,400
retention they went with a two-year

335
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:11,550
retention and was able to set policy on

336
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,800
that so that they can keep their email

337
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,000
more manageable and a two-year rolling

338
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,740
basis so again there's some choices that

339
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,950
you can make as you talk through

340
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:28,800
priority and as well as modality on what

341
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:31,800
will work even something as basic as a

342
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,650
paper backup file for personnel files in

343
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,990
their case was more than sufficient it

344
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:40,199
didn't have to be electronic most people

345
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,210
obviously wanted to fall to that but if

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,030
you have everything on paper and you

347
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,450
keep it in two separate places that's

348
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:50,310
okay in some in some instances now in

349
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,860
larger businesses that wouldn't be even

350
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,469
viable so you have to think about it

351
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:01,860
from the scope and the scale that you're

352
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:05,400
applying this criteria to so let's talk

353
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,790
about the scope and requirements

354
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,170
checklist and this would be the

355
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,300
checklist that you would sit down with

356
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,780
your business owner a business partner

357
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,099
for a specific application and have this

358
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,260
discussion with them in reference to how

359
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:26,629
you can best serve them and building a

360
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:30,270
plan that is reasonable and repeatable

361
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,610
for them to provide them best quality

362
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,260
service as an information professional

363
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,570
and support personnel partner for them

364
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,040
so answers you need from the business

365
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,820
owner what

366
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,340
you need from the business owner is ask

367
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,450
them what do you feel is the likelihood

368
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,850
that this application could fail have

369
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,250
you ever experienced a failure find out

370
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,199
whether or not they have been through a

371
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,510
failure how did they deal with it before

372
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,240
what impact did it have how long were

373
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,580
they out what would they do differently

374
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,650
you'll be surprised what people will

375
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,790
share with you because they they learnt

376
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,470
them something during that time period

377
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:16,020
do they think it might be a target for

378
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,670
ransomware you know if their financial

379
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,440
owner they might think that they are a

380
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,010
target and they may have some anxiety

381
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,810
about what they share with you as an IT

382
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,800
partner it's really important for you to

383
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:31,110
set expectations early that we don't

384
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,040
want to over calibrate what we do with

385
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,439
them and back up everything and in that

386
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,870
sense we want to have some sense of

387
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:46,770
reasonableness but at the same time we

388
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:49,590
don't want to to go with the least the

389
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,570
least cost approach if this truly is a

390
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,560
source of anxiety and concern for them

391
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,300
and they may be more than willing to pay

392
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,620
to make sure that that's calibrated

393
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:07,169
according to the correct level of risk

394
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,520
acceptance for them and then the most

395
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,200
two important questions you're going to

396
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,750
get after you kind of break the ice

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,130
there with the likelihood question is

398
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,980
you want to know what is the acceptable

399
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,410
acceptable recovery time objective and

400
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm gonna put this some very layman

401
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:30,450
terms for everyone in this group as well

402
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:33,689
as anybody who might view this later the

403
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:38,970
recovery time objective is specifically

404
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:44,460
how much time can something go out be

405
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:48,480
offline and then be recovered within so

406
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,270
it's not just how long can you be down

407
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,130
or down time you want to be very

408
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,800
specific with them about now

409
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,820
only is it downtime but time to

410
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:03,320
re-establish services should be part of

411
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,030
that recovery time our RTO objective

412
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,850
calculation so if you know it's gonna

413
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,420
take you a half a day to reinstall

414
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:15,929
everything on the server install the

415
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,720
configs run some tasks put correct users

416
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:22,320
in and put in the encryption keys

417
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,290
password resets everything that needs to

418
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,429
go in and then you load their data they

419
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,990
need to be very aware of how that works

420
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,960
in some cases you may not have to go

421
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,210
through quite so much as far as all

422
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,940
those activities are concerned but as

423
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,740
you are talking through recovery time

424
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,500
objective it's important for the

425
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,180
business owner to know it's not it's a

426
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,410
little bit more complicated than you

427
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,300
just reloading a file onto a server and

428
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,150
poof everything's perfect again it

429
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,639
doesn't quite work that way as everyone

430
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,040
on this call knows but the business

431
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,040
owner would not so it's very important

432
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,750
for you to educate them as to what RTO

433
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:09,360
truly means into end and then establish

434
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,780
an accept acceptable recovery point

435
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,649
objective now this is more important

436
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:20,250
with things that are processing at a

437
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:23,630
very high transactional rate so if you

438
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:28,170
are on in e-commerce in York you are

439
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:32,190
processing hundreds or hundreds of

440
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:34,290
thousands of transactions obviously your

441
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,560
recovery point might be extremely

442
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,770
important you might only you might want

443
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,040
to be able to go back and recreate

444
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:47,570
transactions you know as much as within

445
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:50,659
an hour or two in some cases of

446
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,970
processing that but that is a very

447
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:58,230
stringent backup and it would require

448
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,030
quite a bit of cost and service to

449
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,940
provide so you want to make sure that

450
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,860
you are managing those expectations

451
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,700
accordingly and you do not want to talk

452
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,469
about recovery point

453
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,410
until you talked about recovery time

454
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,860
because that has a tendency to help the

455
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:18,130
business owner understand what recovery

456
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,840
point really is reasonable after they

457
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,210
talk about recovery time if they say

458
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,230
well I can be down for you know three

459
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,410
days and everything and if we as long as

460
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,150
we can get back to the day that we had

461
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,750
the incident I'm good

462
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,780
or if we can get back you know get back

463
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:41,620
on line and rebuild transactions within

464
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,470
24 to 48 hours I'm good so then you

465
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:48,939
start having a much more meaningful

466
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:51,700
conversation about downtime in recovery

467
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,650
are bringing things back online versus

468
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:59,800
the point at which the data is lost and

469
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,900
needs to be rebuilt so that's kind of

470
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,060
important as well

471
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,540
those two conversational points need to

472
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,429
happen during this initial conversation

473
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:12,010
and then the next two things are things

474
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,920
that I added that I do is sort of a best

475
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,720
practice and that is do you know if your

476
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,090
system is a dependency for another

477
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
system of critical value you'd be

478
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,250
surprised

479
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,110
a lot of your business centers know a

480
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,590
whole lot more about integrations and

481
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,530
who are they dependent on then sometimes

482
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,649
your asset management people they're

483
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:35,350
getting data into their systems in a

484
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,600
variety of ways they're not always well

485
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,320
documented especially if the system is

486
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,080
older than two years sometimes the

487
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,720
documentation past implementation kind

488
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,720
of drops off and some people don't

489
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,280
always update things like they should so

490
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,200
it's important for you to know whether

491
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,080
or not that this application is it's a

492
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,710
pendency for something else in which

493
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,600
case you're about your backup plan then

494
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,780
takes on additional importance for that

495
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,310
other system the critical value as well

496
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,820
because they're depending on you to come

497
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:11,919
up first and then finally you want to

498
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,080
create a communication plan at that time

499
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,290
with the business owner around an

500
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,300
incident management playbook script you

501
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,100
want to know what's your call tree what

502
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,450
happens

503
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,490
this goes down who do I call how can the

504
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,100
business step in and partner with you to

505
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,530
understand yes we have an issue we're

506
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,179
going to put our playbook in play we

507
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,840
need to get these following people on

508
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,600
line to help us you know ratify or

509
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,260
validate that the recovery has been

510
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,990
successful and go ahead and put in any

511
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:48,750
back transactions or redo transactions

512
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,390
or records back into the system in order

513
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,420
to get things back up to you know pre

514
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,070
failure point if at all possible and you

515
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,160
want to make sure that they understand

516
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,520
what that communication plan is and what

517
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,200
your service level agreement as well for

518
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,150
that communication point is they get

519
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,960
notified within you know two hours

520
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,490
within four hours they get minified in

521
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,260
15 minutes if they're a critical

522
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,420
application etc it just depends on your

523
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,570
company and what SLA is are around

524
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:25,470
critical systems as well as tailoring it

525
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:28,110
to - to the backup itself and what needs

526
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,380
to happen and in reference to you 84

527
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,840
that as you bring it back online so now

528
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,960
once you get those things established

529
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,689
with a business owner there's a few

530
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,520
things that kind of you need to tailor

531
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,070
around the system itself or the

532
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,410
application itself what mode of backup

533
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,000
is sufficient I know it sounds like a

534
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,600
really stupid question

535
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,150
but for some people paper is good enough

536
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,600
there they're actually okay with it

537
00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:01,350
being paper as long as it's held offline

538
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:05,899
I know one company in particular keeps I

539
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:11,100
nines of human resource individuals on

540
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:12,750
paper file for two years and that is

541
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,850
their backup they scan it and it goes in

542
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,980
as a part of the person's HR record but

543
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,469
at the same time they keep the paper

544
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,840
copy for two years so then they have to

545
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,910
obviously copies and the paper copy is

546
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,179
considered the backup and it's kept

547
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:30,750
off-site so it might be something that's

548
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:34,559
simple maybe goes to disk maybe goes to

549
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:37,250
tape in some older situations

550
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,980
in situations where none of that exists

551
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,890
or is desirable there are obviously lots

552
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,350
of managed service providers in this

553
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,140
space that would be more than delighted

554
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:52,459
to walk you through how to back things

555
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,230
up to the cloud and if you don't have

556
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,020
you know if if you have a lot of data

557
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,929
that would definitely be something

558
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:03,750
obviously that you would want to do with

559
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:07,020
some more serious consulting onboard but

560
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,529
if you are a small to medium sized you

561
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,360
know concern and you have a good plan

562
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:18,360
you may be able to walk through that

563
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:21,469
fairly quickly with Azure or AWS and and

564
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,110
be up and running with a very solid

565
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:28,620
off-site backup why is that important

566
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,678
why is offsite important most ransomware

567
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,239
is going to come in directly through

568
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,909
your network so they're gonna hit your

569
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,309
your if you're backing up to a share

570
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:41,250
drive or if you have shadow copies

571
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:44,279
they're going to hit those before they

572
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,320
pull the trigger so you definitely want

573
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,429
to make sure that your backup is

574
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,620
off-site also if you have something

575
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,860
that's super mission-critical and you

576
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:59,489
think it's super likely that it might

577
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:04,168
get hit it might also be who view to

578
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:06,120
have more than one backup instance so

579
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:09,450
that there is if you will an air gap

580
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,610
between those backups that's done you

581
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,919
know on an acceptable rotating basis

582
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,559
whether that's weekly or monthly it's

583
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,649
kind of what your pocketbook and your

584
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,559
wrist posture will allow you but

585
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:24,658
seriously do ask on what mode is

586
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,299
sufficient and that mode may be

587
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,539
different for different types of system

588
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:32,220
or data what is the retention policy I

589
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,990
think I mentioned that earlier in the

590
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,559
priority sample but what is the

591
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:40,830
retention policy for the system or the

592
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,830
data in this system specifically if you

593
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,529
don't have one established the time to

594
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,340
get one is now there's never a better

595
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,800
time to

596
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,780
ago she ate a retention policy then when

597
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,330
you're talking backups because that's

598
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,889
really you're only going to back up

599
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,820
what's going to be used or what you're

600
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:02,190
going to be held accountable for I do

601
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,500
know some organizations that in the past

602
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,820
have literally backed up everything

603
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,060
forever and that's not the best policy

604
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,139
long term that actually can legally get

605
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,379
you into trouble

606
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,560
long term it is much more to your

607
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,990
benefit to have an established written

608
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,030
information security plan that says this

609
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,060
type of data is kept for this long and

610
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:29,190
that you can establish a routine basis

611
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:32,970
that shows that you keep the data for

612
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:34,640
that long and only that long as it

613
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,770
applies now of course data retention

614
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,440
guidelines for different types of data

615
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,180
are different so obviously you don't

616
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,060
want to keep you know everything here

617
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,610
some things obviously required by

618
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,429
different bodies legal documents you

619
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,379
want to keep for example leases and real

620
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,550
estate things you want to keep for the

621
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:59,000
entirety of your tenure with that piece

622
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:03,720
of property whether you were the owner

623
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,420
or the buyer in that situation if you

624
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,540
are if you have been involved in a real

625
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,380
estate transaction hold on to that

626
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,690
contract period it is extremely

627
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,460
important that you do that in case there

628
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,520
is some kind of legal situation that

629
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,240
comes up years later after even if you

630
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:29,340
are not in the property at that time so

631
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:31,350
real estate IRS data financial merger

632
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,939
and acquisitions data all of those types

633
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,090
of things you're going to want to keep

634
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,460
ten to fifteen years in the case of

635
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,889
medical records there are stringent

636
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:46,860
HIPAA guidelines around that that are

637
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:49,580
age specific so if you have patients

638
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,050
within your firm that are under 18

639
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:55,470
obviously retention for those records is

640
00:30:52,050 --> 00:31:00,270
longer than an adult over the age of 18

641
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,360
so do consult the appropriate guidelines

642
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,889
and either

643
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,809
mr. Osaka for retention policies for

644
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,280
legal reasons contact your attorney if

645
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,139
you have one and they'll be happy to

646
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,559
walk you through that retention policy

647
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,200
time box but now is the perfect time if

648
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,889
you don't have a retention policy to get

649
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,910
one what frequency doesn't need to be

650
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:26,500
backed up sometimes you know you only

651
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,450
need to back it up

652
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,580
you know once a month or just not that

653
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,940
many changes in this application over

654
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,399
that time period it might be daily it

655
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,590
might be an incremental over the course

656
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,570
of the week and a full backup on Sunday

657
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,030
you're going to want to look at what

658
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,270
those requirements need to be from an

659
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,610
RTO RPO perspective that you've already

660
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:52,240
gained from your initial conversation

661
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,750
from the business owner and then what

662
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,820
kind of backup are they accepting and

663
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,220
you're probably going to need what is

664
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,850
acceptable right what works in this

665
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:07,390
situation in some cases you know they're

666
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:11,409
they're using a software you know a

667
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:14,559
backup that's acceptable to that version

668
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:17,110
of that cots software may be just fine

669
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,889
so is it's a data that's it's a data

670
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,199
file essentially that is configured to

671
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:27,130
work if you will by being reinstalled

672
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,669
into an existing situation however there

673
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,230
are other situations in enterprises

674
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:35,049
where it would require for you to

675
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,900
completely strip the server do an app

676
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:41,500
install know what the configuration was

677
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:44,350
prior to failure and then also install

678
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,059
the backup accordingly so what kind of a

679
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:49,270
cup are you talking about when you say

680
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:52,899
yeah sure well back that up be specific

681
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,400
with the business owner as to and the

682
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,860
technical owner for that matter as to

683
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,679
what that backup would entail what that

684
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,928
backup plan should entail and then

685
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,580
finally do you need to store copies

686
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,710
independently as I mentioned earlier

687
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,590
about air gaps between separate

688
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,410
locations just cetera and making sure if

689
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:14,540
you have a dependency that you work with

690
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:17,060
who the application owner of the

691
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,730
tendency is and the order of operations

692
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,040
to restore if you happen to be lucky

693
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,960
enough to be in an enterprise operation

694
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,370
where you have either a disaster

695
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,260
recovery or a risk management function I

696
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,120
would obviously recommend that you work

697
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,050
with them as to what that order of

698
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,899
operations is is a part of your overall

699
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:41,360
disaster or business continuity plan so

700
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,480
that as you conduct exercises you do

701
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,010
them in the appropriate order so that

702
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:52,610
operations are restored optimally for

703
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:55,490
all across dependencies so once you've

704
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,949
got your plan all put together and you

705
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,720
got your checklist of requirements and

706
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,390
and what you need to do you for that

707
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,890
particular application next you're going

708
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:09,260
to put those things into play a couple

709
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,360
of best practices to reiterate number

710
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,940
one you want to identify an off network

711
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,250
location for the backup and yes that

712
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,740
includes if it's a paper backup you

713
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:22,940
definitely want it off site or off

714
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:25,219
network and so that is completely not

715
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,540
reachable by someone who is either a

716
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:31,459
insider threat be ransomware and

717
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,710
laterally moving within your system etc

718
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,010
you want to make sure that you are off

719
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:40,610
network that you are not relying solely

720
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:43,160
on something that's on a share or even

721
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:46,250
on a segmented component of your network

722
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,190
is less desirable than being completely

723
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:52,510
separated do not rely on shadow copies

724
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,220
and do not rely on an alternate share

725
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:59,360
you want to use a separate network

726
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,950
account to perform backups this actually

727
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:07,210
made a whole lot of sense to me as I was

728
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:07,210
doing research for this talk today the

729
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:16,500
taking of privileges or the exploitation

730
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,260
of privileges via phishing emails for

731
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,559
example if the person who's exploited

732
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,510
happens to be an administrator then

733
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,900
there they can use administrative

734
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,569
privileges to to actually reach into the

735
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,710
backups so you want to avoid that you

736
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,380
want to make sure that there is a

737
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,660
separate Network account preferably

738
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,990
checked in through something like

739
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:42,868
cyber-ark etc that performs those

740
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:46,410
backups that it's not a specific users

741
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:48,660
network credentials or administrative

742
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,779
contentions that do that to prevent any

743
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,190
kind of compromise of those credentials

744
00:35:50,780 --> 00:36:00,089
then compromising your backup activities

745
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:02,250
especially unbeknownst to you you want

746
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:06,779
to automate backups using the RPO and

747
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:09,500
RTO policy parameters on automation is

748
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,630
the way to go most of these things are

749
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,020
if you go to the cloud you can you can

750
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,910
set it and it'll go off like clockwork

751
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,619
it is a whole lot better than having and

752
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,220
somebody put something on their calendar

753
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:26,430
and manually go back something up people

754
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,069
get sick people leave the company things

755
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:32,368
happen when you have a manual schedule

756
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:35,910
of backups if it's not something that

757
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:39,089
you can automate for cost reasons you

758
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:41,190
should have more than one group or were

759
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:44,730
more than one person responsible for a

760
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,220
manual backup schedule I happen to know

761
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,920
of a hotel chain that had an issue with

762
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:55,348
this for example on a New Year's Day

763
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,619
clock over the person that had taken

764
00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:00,960
over the front desk was also responsible

765
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:04,140
for backing up the computer overnight

766
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,940
from the previous year to the next year

767
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,578
as a part of their duties well something

768
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,930
happened with that backup and they lost

769
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,309
the better part of that calendar year

770
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,618
again when you're doing manual backups

771
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,049
things can happen you know you know

772
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,849
there's a human error component of that

773
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:23,040
that really should be listened to so if

774
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:26,670
you can automate automate automate

775
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,310
and also that legitimizes as well that

776
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,260
you're following specific rpoud RTO

777
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:34,740
policies per your conversations with

778
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,440
your business owner you want to make

779
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,629
sure that you locate and store

780
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,060
encryption keys certificates and

781
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,910
passwords also separately off-site

782
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,750
doesn't help you if you put them in the

783
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:51,569
same location obviously as where the

784
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,030
backups are being kept you that's again

785
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,670
is something that is a good best

786
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,820
practice goes without saying that you

787
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:04,230
want to make sure that you do encrypt

788
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:07,980
your data both at rest and in transit to

789
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,960
its backup location so making sure that

790
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,910
you have those encryption keys available

791
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,710
and that your digital certificates are

792
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:19,290
up to date is very important you want to

793
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,590
perform a tabletop exercise at the

794
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:25,110
initial launch or implementation if you

795
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,080
will of your backup strategy you want to

796
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:31,560
perform a tabletop exercise to simulate

797
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,720
a loss whether it's the fact that you

798
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,850
can't get to it or you want to build up

799
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,000
completely in parallel a complete

800
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:41,310
failure to see if you can you're gonna

801
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,650
follow that recovery play route and the

802
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,299
communication plan with the business

803
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,460
owner in the know obviously I'm not

804
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,110
asking you to you know spring this on

805
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,780
them but at the same time you should

806
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:54,630
perform that tabletop exercise to prove

807
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:59,210
that you can recover the system

808
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:01,800
completely back to the recovery point

809
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,980
that you agree to and during the

810
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,470
recovery time box window that you

811
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,140
thought you could you want to confirm

812
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:13,740
the actual time to full recovery with an

813
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,020
application they may think that or even

814
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,100
technical a nurse might think hey we

815
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,320
could probably get this thing back

816
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,150
online give us the file we can have it

817
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,940
back up online and probably about you

818
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,370
know three four hours ok well let's test

819
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,610
that let's see whether or not that

820
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:31,200
that's true in many cases if you don't

821
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,150
have a solid playbook or you've never

822
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,049
had to do it before it can take up to

823
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,020
three days in

824
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:40,450
cases and that's kind of an eye-opening

825
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,730
experience to a business owner who feels

826
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,919
like oh well my tech guy says that he

827
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,980
can get things back on and in three

828
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,200
minutes in three hours well you need to

829
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:53,590
you need to prove that out I'd hate to

830
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,189
make an example of anybody but part of

831
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,950
having a solid recovery is understanding

832
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,440
what it's going to take to make that

833
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,450
solid recovery happen happen in setting

834
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,000
realistic expectations around that

835
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,189
recovery timeframe if it needs to be

836
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,780
better than that then what are you going

837
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,360
to have to do or what are you going to

838
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,940
have to spend to make that happen and

839
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,850
again if it's a do and spin the

840
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,650
proposition it's not a year it's not

841
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,520
your proposition to answer it's the

842
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:26,110
business owners to accept and that is

843
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,509
where the rubber meets the road in

844
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:31,120
situations like this so confirm that

845
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,700
actual time to full recovery with

846
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,410
application and business owners you want

847
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,899
to update the playbook with any lessons

848
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,930
learned that you identified during the

849
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,330
tabletop exercise or any gaps that you

850
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:46,540
found during testing maybe you found out

851
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:49,569
that there was a key password or there

852
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:52,120
was a key configuration that was not

853
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:55,390
part of the initial playbook that needs

854
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:59,440
to be there for example something as

855
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:02,410
silly as well our templates for our

856
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,870
email automated emails didn't didn't

857
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:08,140
come over in the backup so we know next

858
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:11,670
time that we're going to have to copy

859
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:15,310
and paste those into a file and then

860
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,780
redo those ten configs as sipar bringing

861
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,730
this back online

862
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:22,030
right might be something as simple as

863
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:24,340
that but it may not come across with the

864
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,550
backup I know that's true with one

865
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,010
system particularly that I work with

866
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:36,070
that those templates are are only good

867
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:37,060
for that particular installation so you

868
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,490
want to update your PlayBook with

869
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,270
lessons learning gaps during found

870
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,270
during the testing

871
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,160
and then the next phase once you get

872
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,780
that all documented you're going to move

873
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,089
into what's called a monitoring phase

874
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,760
and this is where risk management really

875
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,310
comes into play it's not a set it and

876
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,109
forget it thing it's very important you

877
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,600
put in a lot of time and effort to make

878
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:02,130
sure that you can not only back up the

879
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,250
appropriate information but actually

880
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,400
restore from it as of the tabletop

881
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:12,930
exercise date but again things happen

882
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,980
right people change systems change the

883
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:18,750
environment itself could be breached

884
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,650
during that time backup failure

885
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:26,720
notifications should be monitored for

886
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:29,790
now in some cases those backup failures

887
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,609
notifications may fail themselves okay

888
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:36,180
and if they do you need to have a backup

889
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:39,299
for a periodic file review on your

890
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,270
calendar to go and look on a on a set

891
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,410
basis is the scope and size of the files

892
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:49,320
that were being backed up consistent as

893
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:51,330
to your baseline is the data integrity

894
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,760
there can you open the file is it

895
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,950
readable is it truncated is it has

896
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,890
anything happened to the data integrity

897
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:00,990
of the file not necessarily you want to

898
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,500
go through everything to restore it but

899
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:07,740
open the file and make sure that it is

900
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:09,510
that it is readable you know it seems

901
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,250
kind of silly but it's a basic thing

902
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,340
that can be done in two seconds

903
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:17,190
but identify a major problem and then of

904
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:23,670
course delivery if you're not getting a

905
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:26,670
failure notification but you know it

906
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,940
that notification piece has failed and

907
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:33,060
you go in you look in where it should be

908
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:38,190
being delivered on a let's say weekly

909
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:40,350
basis Sunday at 3 a.m. then and there's

910
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,910
no file there for the last three weeks

911
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,549
and you haven't gotten a notification

912
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,250
failure you have maybe more than one

913
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:51,660
thing wrong right so some of this is

914
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:54,450
spot checking to make sure that you know

915
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,740
that things are working according to

916
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:00,089
that plan

917
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:02,490
on some kind of routine basis if you

918
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:05,308
have had a back up failure notification

919
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:08,069
and you want to have a procedural

920
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,660
document ready for the team to go in and

921
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:12,029
say what do I do about this backup

922
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,920
failure what caused the backup failure

923
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:17,369
was there a collision was there a

924
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:22,500
problem in the network transmission when

925
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:25,530
can we redo that backup kim do we need

926
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,160
to communicate that we have a gap in

927
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:31,680
data if that's something that happened

928
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,920
during transition can we go back and

929
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:39,569
rewrite to that point in time based on

930
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,040
our current situation or not so what are

931
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:42,569
your options those are the things that

932
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,910
should be outlined in the procedure

933
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:46,470
document for a backup failure and you

934
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,089
should be following those rules with

935
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,399
your business owner and yes they should

936
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:53,790
be notified if there is a backup failure

937
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,460
and what you did about it and then

938
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,890
finally backup the support file change

939
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,980
review as well on that same periodic

940
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,690
basis if there's been password changes

941
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,690
you're going to rotate passwords every

942
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,309
so often if you're doing that manually

943
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,040
versus systematically you're going to

944
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:14,220
want to make sure that this file change

945
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,319
is updated encryption keys are still

946
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,980
valid Digital certifications are still

947
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,410
active and then the other thing you want

948
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,200
to do in at least an annual basis you

949
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:29,490
see who's actually been accessing the

950
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:32,098
backup files other other than yourself

951
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,930
obviously in double-checking things

952
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,640
you're going to have an access control

953
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:39,379
list for the individuals who are

954
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,750
authorized to look at those backups in

955
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,790
utilize them for recovery you want to

956
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,680
see if those individuals have gone in

957
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,630
you want to see if anyone that's not on

958
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,750
that list has gone in or anything you

959
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,490
don't recognize obviously all of those

960
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,900
would be indicators of compromised so

961
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,779
you want to make sure that you're doing

962
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:01,589
the basics on on the user access review

963
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:05,809
to ensure the confidentiality integrity

964
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:05,808
and availability of those files

965
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:14,400
and then lastly once your you've got

966
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:18,150
yourself on a good monitoring foot you

967
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,270
do want to establish that the whole

968
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:24,540
back-up plan it or the whole tabletop

969
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:28,050
exercise if it's more than one system is

970
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:30,600
tested on a routine basis so that there

971
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:34,560
are no issues when not if an event

972
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,880
happens typically this is where you

973
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,049
start running into resistance with

974
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,720
business centers they get a little

975
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,520
burned out that you're monitoring their

976
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,799
stuff you've shown them that you can

977
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,450
perform the backup they don't really

978
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,570
understand why we have to have a

979
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,779
tabletop every year or every six months

980
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:54,450
if it's a super critical something and

981
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,110
it's important for them to understand

982
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:00,839
that once you've established that

983
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:02,700
footing with or maturity with the

984
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,000
application and the backup processes

985
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,680
it's important that you maintain it and

986
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,160
the only way you can maintain it is to

987
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,799
exercise it and make sure that you are

988
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,980
catching any changes or problems that

989
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,040
have happened many applications

990
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:25,500
establish a maintenance window if your

991
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:28,080
client is resistant to you performing an

992
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,390
annual recovery test because they don't

993
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:34,049
have time for it

994
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:38,190
do it yourself schedule a test during a

995
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:40,980
maintenance window and do it I guarantee

996
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:45,060
you you will be held accountable should

997
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:48,600
something happen so if you can't if you

998
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:51,060
can't get them on to participate do go

999
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,089
ahead and exercise the application with

1000
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,580
notice during a maintenance window to

1001
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:01,470
fulfill that requirement it is the only

1002
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:04,950
way to maintain 100% assurance that what

1003
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:08,069
you have is recoverable and you can live

1004
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:13,980
up to what you have agreed to in support

1005
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:15,300
of the client so a few last words and

1006
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,300
then I'm going to open it up to the

1007
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,880
floor for any questions first of all

1008
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,870
it's really important to dispel

1009
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,110
assumptions with clients up front one of

1010
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:32,910
my clients in the last year and a half

1011
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:36,870
has been a group of attorneys and their

1012
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:40,440
assumption has always been that no one

1013
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:44,009
no one is ever going to knock back

1014
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,860
something up and the reality is in a

1015
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:50,520
business that's been open more than five

1016
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:53,940
years not backing up everything that

1017
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:56,400
thousands of employees or transactions

1018
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,080
that are millions of transactions that

1019
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,520
have happened over that time period is

1020
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:06,720
not realistic we do have to set data

1021
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:10,290
retention policies we do need to be good

1022
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,870
stewards of our resources and if there

1023
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:17,009
is a reason if there's a critical legal

1024
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:20,930
or compliance reason then we will do our

1025
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:23,910
best to fulfill that commitment however

1026
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:26,669
that commitment is for things that

1027
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:29,790
deserve it not for everything

1028
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,040
just in case which was actual wording

1029
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:35,940
that one of the attorneys said well what

1030
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:39,290
if we need it just in case you just

1031
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:43,050
can't build you know an operational

1032
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:45,690
practice around just in case to some

1033
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:48,630
extent you have to start being judicious

1034
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:51,300
and a good steward of your monies so

1035
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,940
that's where you have to kind of dispel

1036
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,430
assumptions as you know I t's going to

1037
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,330
save you no matter what is not a good

1038
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:01,500
assumption

1039
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:05,580
setting realistic expectations with the

1040
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:08,070
client is extremely important not only

1041
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,560
from set from the beginning where you're

1042
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,380
setting requirements with them they have

1043
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,390
ownership of those requirements but then

1044
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,640
showing that you can deliver to those

1045
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,650
requirements so that you have a

1046
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,009
realistic baseline is extremely

1047
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:25,510
important and then finally reinforcing

1048
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:28,330
all the hard work you've done

1049
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:31,570
only matters if you continually do this

1050
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:34,960
in to end that's what will equal success

1051
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:37,630
in the end so it's important not just to

1052
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,530
talk about it not just to set it up once

1053
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:41,800
and forget it

1054
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:45,070
but to to talk about it to set the

1055
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,200
policy to test it and then to retest it

1056
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:50,109
on a routine basis so that you are

1057
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,480
assured that you can back up and perform

1058
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:56,200
to the level to which you are being

1059
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,020
entrusted as an IT partner so those are

1060
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:02,859
my last words today I'm going to give it

1061
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:06,880
back over to the presenter and if

1062
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:08,290
there's any questions or anything I can

1063
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,210
share with you in the way of best

1064
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,210
practice I'd be delighted to do so

1065
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,740
does anyone have questions for Robin

1066
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:32,460
I think you blew them all away I kind of

1067
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:36,540
doubt that I'm sure they'll think of 15

1068
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,480
other things it's a it's a lot to take

1069
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:41,120
in at once and I was watching another

1070
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,160
presenters presentation this morning on

1071
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:48,890
password cracking and it was amazing I

1072
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:52,680
know my brain was blown watching there's

1073
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:56,790
one of the things that I feel like that

1074
00:51:52,680 --> 00:52:00,450
I can offer up to this audience and to

1075
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:04,200
my colleagues in general is I've done a

1076
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:07,589
lot of what I would call consulting with

1077
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,500
people to get them around all the text

1078
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:12,930
speak to actually get done what is

1079
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,810
meaningful and thoughtful in their space

1080
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:19,589
and I'd really encourage you as

1081
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:22,950
information security professionals you

1082
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:27,080
know to take that tact we get geeky we

1083
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:30,390
all get geeky on certain subjects but

1084
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:34,500
really when it comes down to it our

1085
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:36,990
business partners want someone who knows

1086
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,900
that in their heart they have their best

1087
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:42,509
interests in mind and will be their

1088
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,210
partner when something terrible does

1089
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,430
happen and it will there there will be

1090
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,350
times that that there will be something

1091
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,000
that happens that obviously was

1092
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:57,270
unplanned whether it be a failure a BCP

1093
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,510
situation or god forbid a ransomware one

1094
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:02,520
but if you can get a basic practice

1095
