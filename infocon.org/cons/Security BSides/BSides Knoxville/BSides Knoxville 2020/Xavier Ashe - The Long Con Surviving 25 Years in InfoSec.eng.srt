shot up to you guys so today I'm going

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,750
to be talking about my experience in the

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,969
in the field I feel very fortunate that

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,410
I've been able to survive as long as I

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,570
have and I wanted to share those

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,319
experiences I've had a number of

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,020
different careers or and and shifted

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,989
gears quite a bit and I wanted to bring

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,559
those experiences to you guys so that

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,980
you can hopefully learn something from

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,128
my you know path and help you you know

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,479
be happy in your career so so that's the

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,280
goal here so let's get the right button

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,729
there all right so a little bit about me

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,549
so my name is Xavier Ashe I have been

27
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,679
hacking since late 80s and I got my

28
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:28,619
first job I started started a job in

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:30,750
1992 we've got a real job in 1994 so so

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,310
basically I've been doing computer

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,470
security for for about 28 years now so I

32
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,240
worked for a lot of different type of

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,340
companies I've worked for a large

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,490
companies like Gartner IBM and worked

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,799
for very high growth companies Carbon

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,439
Black was on my very fun ones I was

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,939
joined when they were bit 9 I think I

38
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:01,408
was employee number 142 for that so I

39
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,389
was able to see that to grow to a thick

40
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,240
goes Oh a little over 500 by the time I

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,590
left and they transformed into carbon

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,139
black

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,300
did that a couple times I was

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,268
independent consultant for a while I

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,769
always joked that hey you're you're

46
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,599
you're never unemployed you're just an

47
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:34,140
independent consultant but that is

48
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:35,790
because all my so basically that get

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,859
back on track here so yeah in freaking

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,109
so you know and we'll talk a little bit

51
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,870
about those different working modes here

52
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,910
a little bit later in the presentation

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,060
and I've done a couple startups I was

54
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,120
employee number one for a start-up that

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,510
deal with micro segmentation that was

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,010
fun

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:59,370
I've I was part and I've started my own

58
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,629
companies a couple of times so I've got

59
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,510
lots of failed businesses under my belt

60
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:09,959
right now I am the VP and security

61
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,959
operations I run a two different two or

62
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,180
three different teams boarding on a yes

63
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,329
I went countermeasures

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,220
production support and I still kind of

65
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,859
help out with my security engineering

66
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,160
team so I've got a couple of teams on

67
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,480
the knife under my belt I like to brag

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,400
of a little bit about this is and I

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,738
think with this type of presentation it

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,739
is pretty important but I was a lay

71
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,370
minister for a while and that's really

72
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,380
helped me and my leadership skills I've

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,440
and as carried over here and you'll see

74
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,510
as the things that I care about is it

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,919
might be a little bit different than

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,940
what you might hear and a lot of you

77
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:54,000
know technical presentations as is that

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,690
I think happiness and and your success

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,760
in your career is not a purely you know

80
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,480
how many search do you have and how much

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,880
money can you make

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,768
yeah that's that's definitely you know

83
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,109
what I find important a couple of

84
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:11,040
different places you can find me on the

85
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:15,739
on the interwebs so what do I want you

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,478
to take away from this presentation I

87
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,720
started this presentation all this

88
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,510
research

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,650
when I was looking at people that were

90
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:28,690
leaving the company that was working for

91
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,299
for a variety of different reasons and I

92
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,930
found that it was it was disheartening

93
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,080
because I could see that they were me

94
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,140
you know some of them were making leaps

95
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,570
for the wrong reasons and and and so

96
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,300
when the opportunity I had to coach some

97
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,219
of them you know to find out why they

98
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,630
were looking at leaving doing X

99
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,280
interviews you know and and hopefully

100
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,159
you know guided a couple of people but

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,679
so I thought well you know there's a lot

102
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,900
of good like mental health and and you

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,850
know how to avoid burnout type of

104
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,159
presentation so I said yeah this is it's

105
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,510
gonna need to make a you know

106
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,710
non-technical presentation this year for

107
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,940
the rounds of cons and and share my

108
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,890
experiences here because I think that

109
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,380
this is very important so I want you to

110
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,110
take away a couple points you know that

111
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,730
you are probably not alone we're gonna

112
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,300
go through some statistics to look at

113
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,890
how people are feeling about information

114
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,490
security right now

115
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:34,300
you know find out why people change jobs

116
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,380
why do people get up and quit and and

117
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,950
then boy and talk about burnout it's

118
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:45,550
obvious we're going to you know talk

119
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,150
about you know how to identify a toxic

120
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,520
situation

121
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,859
I call them hard lines things that you

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,799
really shouldn't put up with and I hope

123
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,750
that you will you know if you find

124
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,070
yourself in those situations be able to

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,040
make a change

126
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,680
alright so you know if you get to a

127
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,630
point where it's like yes I do want to

128
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,940
actually move on to something else

129
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,650
you know what is there gas like on the

130
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,360
other side so I'm gonna go through and

131
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,090
talk about a couple of different job

132
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,370
types and really talk about the motility

133
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,060
of the job like what is it that the job

134
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,919
is like not from a technical point of

135
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,650
view because uh you get a lot of that

136
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,440
already but but the day-to-day the and

137
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,810
and anybody that's ever

138
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,330
if you've ever you know done any kind of

139
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,560
job hunting search you might have come

140
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,349
across this book what is the color of

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,530
your parachute

142
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,090
I bring that up and talk about why I

143
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,609
think it's a very valuable tool because

144
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:44,500
it talks exactly about this what's the

145
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,860
the type of job that you want to have

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:51,200
not necessarily that the content of the

147
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,150
technical stuff so and then yeah let's

148
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,530
make sure that you can feel confident

149
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:00,409
that you can make it to that twenty five

150
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:04,010
year mark so we're going to start things

151
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:06,050
off with you know is it just me so what

152
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,460
you know let's look at a couple of

153
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:16,330
different statistics here the this is

154
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:18,289
from the ISS a research all the big

155
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,020
differing up statistics from with all

156
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:24,500
the different big organizations this one

157
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,469
is you know if last year most of them

158
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,150
not published this year the trends go

159
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,170
back and you can see there's not huge

160
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:37,030
differentials from 2019 2018 2017 so

161
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,770
this is a you know a fairly good study

162
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,140
first off tell me if this sounds

163
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,289
familiar my company doesn't care

164
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,490
anything about security we are so

165
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,550
insecure is that that's sound familiar

166
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,130
you know in this study is that 91% of

167
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,780
people believe that they're there about

168
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:01,909
their organization was under yeah for

169
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,280
significant cyber attacks that's that's

170
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,370
that's a big deal in general you know it

171
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,799
seems like Issa members are pessimistic

172
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,020
about cybersecurity in general you know

173
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,130
cybersecurity professionals are doing

174
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:19,640
paid to question the status quo and and

175
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,460
we we are paranoid people you know that

176
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,180
said we still are very skeptical about

177
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,489
our chances for success when asked about

178
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,860
the the balance of power between you

179
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,400
know the cyber adversaries and the

180
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:38,150
fenders fifty nine percent believe that

181
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,459
their chances have a you know that their

182
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,870
adversaries have a big advantage over

183
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,839
cyber defenders and I think that's a

184
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,180
pretty big deal right so the next one

185
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,060
here is my company does

186
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,920
training this is uh you know sometime

187
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,920
you know I've heard a lot

188
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,079
I have challenges getting my team all

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,969
the training that they need I've been in

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,210
that boat for a lot for a lot of

191
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,830
different companies is that training is

192
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:07,880
there expensive and it's hard to get to

193
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:11,390
everyone so what does this the Cystic

194
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,120
say about this one this one you know

195
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,830
says you know 63 percent of works I feel

196
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,020
like they have fallen behind in

197
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,820
providing adequate training and this is

198
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:28,220
uh you know it's like pretty significant

199
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:30,529
here and so training and skills you know

200
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,740
are still a big problem you know the

201
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:36,380
research indicates well 93% of surveys

202
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,209
survey respondents in this one agree

203
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,080
that cyber professionals must keep up

204
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:45,140
with their skills or or else you know or

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,500
will be vulnerable so you know here this

206
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,939
you know sixty-three percent say that

207
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,029
they've fallen behind so this

208
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,339
differential here between you know it's

209
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:58,089
very important to I'm not getting what I

210
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:01,970
need shows that there's still a gap that

211
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:04,900
we need to be able to address right so

212
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,940
what's what what else we've got

213
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,459
there we go so we are totally

214
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,100
understaffed right yeah I'm doing the

215
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:15,380
job of two people you know you heard my

216
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:20,089
description I'm running a couple of

217
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:22,959
teams right now so it is you know it's a

218
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,230
kind of a commonplace problem and so

219
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,430
when asked what is the biggest challenge

220
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,810
your cybersecurity challenge at your

221
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,660
organization the number one answer is

222
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,229
cyber security staff is understaffed for

223
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,279
my size of organization so other top

224
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,380
challenges in this particular survey

225
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,810
business managers don't understand or

226
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,410
support an appropriate level of

227
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:51,349
cybersecurity and then the next one was

228
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,230
my organization depends upon too many

229
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,980
manual or informal processes for

230
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,920
cybersecurity

231
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,570
I thought those were pretty interesting

232
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,280
so let's look at another one of the

233
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:05,220
studies we have

234
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,689
this one is from is e squared again

235
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,200
their their last study that they

236
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:14,040
published again number one at the top is

237
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,500
lack of skilled experience is is is

238
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,650
pretty a big deal

239
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,770
so that that's still common you know

240
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,890
can't find the people and you know when

241
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,470
they're not trained I like this one the

242
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,819
twenty percent lack of standard

243
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,620
terminate you know terminology I think

244
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:38,520
that we're getting better with that with

245
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:40,200
the mitre but I still have to every time

246
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm talking with somebody that is new to

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,920
the company or outside of my company we

248
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,630
have to make sure that we're talking the

249
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,130
same language and and so I definitely

250
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,350
feel this one is that the you know

251
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:53,070
without understanding exactly what is

252
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,490
what you know and is it's still pretty

253
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,560
painful to be able to get our job done

254
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,780
you know twenty seven percent of you

255
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,140
know don't have the resources right now

256
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,250
have what they need work-life balance so

257
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,680
we'll talk about that a little bit later

258
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,290
in the presentation and then in adequate

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:16,790
budget for C key security initiatives at

260
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:19,439
the toll tools that you want alright so

261
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,780
more from this study I thought this was

262
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,680
a pretty interesting review so the vast

263
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:28,350
majority of recipients here say that

264
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,870
they are where they expected to be in

265
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,200
their career given the skills and

266
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,360
experience so well well well over half

267
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,790
say they have either very close or

268
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,040
exactly where they expected to be and

269
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,930
that's that's good that some good news

270
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,349
from here is that they are where they

271
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,260
they want to be and in almost half you

272
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,050
have forty nine percent their say they

273
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,140
have a good idea of their desired career

274
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,640
path and I would say I'm still even you

275
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,830
know if twenty eight years into my

276
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,260
career I'm so probably on the second one

277
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,150
I have some idea of my desire creep I'm

278
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,240
not entirely sure I think that's an okay

279
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,040
thing to be I I like to sometimes just

280
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,750
you know what see what opportunities

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,370
arise and and where the wind takes me I

282
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:19,170
think that this is a

283
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,750
an okay place to be as well so let's

284
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,939
talk a little a and the problem with

285
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,610
surveys and so I came process when this

286
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:31,170
is the ISACA survey though went through

287
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,390
and it's pretty interesting the why

288
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,979
cybersecurity leave their jobs I thought

289
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,630
well this is exactly what I'm talking

290
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,170
about from my presentation is was great

291
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,830
data so there at the top 82% leave their

292
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,500
jobs for better financial incentives now

293
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,240
I challenge as I said that doesn't seem

294
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,870
to line up with my experience is that

295
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,630
people don't seem to really leave their

296
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,270
jobs for money so I took a closer look

297
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:01,170
and reread it and it says which of the

298
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,660
following factors do you feel are

299
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,729
causing cybersecurity professionals to

300
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,160
leave their jobs so this is not why

301
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,070
people are leaving but why people think

302
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,010
they're leaving and and it's very

303
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,440
important I pulled up another another

304
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,770
book that I had read as part of my

305
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:24,150
management studies called why do people

306
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:29,010
quit and this is a pretty good study the

307
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,630
from Leah Branham that did it's there

308
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,960
this research is based off of X

309
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,860
interviews III always tried to have exit

310
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,460
interviews

311
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,260
anytime somebody leaves company and and

312
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,750
and pulled out the statistics so

313
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,730
employers that think that their people

314
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,040
leave for more money is 98 percent

315
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,050
that's that's exactly what I stock I

316
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,300
found a very high percentage but

317
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,209
employees who actually leave for more

318
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,370
money is twelve percent so the reality

319
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,200
here is as a big gap between what people

320
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,200
think are happening and what what

321
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,290
actually is happening and I think that's

322
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,580
very important so so if you think that

323
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,380
everybody else is you know waiting for

324
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,089
you know getting paid more and it's

325
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,380
going to hop over reality is that

326
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:18,720
doesn't happen that often so what are

327
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,300
reasons for people to leave so the job

328
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,380
was not expected you know that they they

329
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,399
thought they were getting into something

330
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:30,589
else that really wasn't there

331
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:33,110
the job doesn't fit with their talents

332
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:36,949
and interests this is goes all right

333
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:39,529
along the lines of the color parachute

334
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:42,859
and so we'll talk more about this and

335
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:48,050
and hopefully give you some insight into

336
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:50,750
what these different jobs are they got

337
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,099
little feedback or coaching now as a

338
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,509
leader this is very important to me

339
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,350
because this is something I can control

340
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:00,110
and I want to make sure that you you

341
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,449
know are getting that we can also talk a

342
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,910
little bit later about how you can you

343
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:07,008
know get get this for yourself is that

344
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,219
you don't need to kind of wait for your

345
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:13,459
leaders to do this that you can act on

346
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,889
this without having to change jobs no

347
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:21,518
hope for career growth I a lot of my

348
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,930
management training I took from IBM IBM

349
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,139
you know I took what's called the IBM

350
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,870
MBA it's a two-year course and and and

351
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,399
what's really great about there some

352
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,189
things are really annoying about the way

353
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,079
IBM does management however one thing I

354
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:38,120
did take away is that there you always

355
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,589
need to have both a technical truck and

356
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,389
a management truck and for people to

357
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:47,540
accelerate in their jobs and if this

358
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:51,560
isn't present you get people that you

359
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,939
know are very talented but if they don't

360
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,209
want to become a manager they have

361
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:59,269
nowhere to go to so if you're a leader

362
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:02,540
make sure that you have you know a

363
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,680
career growth for your people but just

364
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,030
don't want to move into management

365
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:11,000
that's just not a given for everyone

366
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,829
feel devalued unrecognized again this is

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,569
something dear to my heart since you

368
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,490
know it's I think it's really in the

369
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,908
hands of our leaders to make sure that

370
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:24,319
we are valuing and recognizing our

371
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:26,990
employees I feel overworked and stressed

372
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,879
out we will definitely be covering this

373
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,460
topic here you know next couple slides

374
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
and last one is lack of trust or

375
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:39,830
confidence and leaders this falls under

376
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,490
my hard lines I do not think that you're

377
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,040
in a situation

378
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,440
with no trust or confidence your leaders

379
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,240
is a place to stay so I I understand

380
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,100
these that this is stuff that in my

381
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,429
experience I've seen this that this

382
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:57,110
research fits my reality and my

383
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:59,720
experiences and so helps as I understand

384
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,600
that this is what people you know really

385
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:08,300
you know move on for so let's talk about

386
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:10,850
stress and burnout so burnout is the you

387
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,059
know exhaustion cynicism and avoidance

388
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,909
this is the and I don't know if I'm

389
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:20,030
pronouncing this right but the mollusc

390
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:23,840
burnout inventory MBI the mulaskey

391
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:27,649
burnout inventory is a kind of a-- it's

392
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,669
a research tool for people that want to

393
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:34,160
try to understand burnout and gives them

394
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,520
ways to you know do the surveys and

395
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,300
index the different impacts these

396
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:46,190
different things have to to somebody

397
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,470
that is in in different industries this

398
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:52,520
did not start in the technical industry

399
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:57,380
this actually originally began in the

400
00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:00,620
medical industry is that we have you

401
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,090
know of course the the stress that you

402
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,760
know people working these these long

403
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,928
shifts in the medical field were hard

404
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:12,470
even before the scope in 1900 real thing

405
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,520
and it does cross different sectors so

406
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,910
let's kind of look into this so

407
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,400
exhaustion is you know this classic

408
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,010
stress response you know basically you

409
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,790
know coming out from from you know from

410
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,890
the big problems employees encounter but

411
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,928
instead from the smaller to day-to-day

412
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,510
issues such as like too much demand with

413
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:36,140
too few resources so both physical and

414
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:40,340
mental exhaustion is as part of this

415
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,880
burnout cynicism alright one of the you

416
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:48,230
know particularly thorny issues for

417
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:51,440
cyber sex professionals since many are

418
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,020
paid to be cynical and find problems

419
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,050
right so this is if

420
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,510
kind of as expected of us but can lead

421
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,879
to our burnout you know the consequences

422
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,310
our employees tend to get negative about

423
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,530
the job that they're doing and the

424
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,179
people they're working with that sound

425
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,160
familiar because we just saw in our

426
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,220
other thing that one of the you know we

427
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,770
we think that you know vast majority of

428
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,630
us feel like we are vulnerable to a

429
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:20,230
significant attack so this this

430
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,360
definitely feeds into it the results in

431
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,030
people doing the this results in people

432
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,320
doing the bare minimum and you know

433
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,420
let's take this job and shove it

434
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,530
mentality that can lead to poor

435
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,150
performance and absences you know

436
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,830
cynicism is it's definitely one of the

437
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,090
factors that can lead to burnout so we

438
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,740
have to keep up with that perceive this

439
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,429
avoidance is the last factor so

440
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,810
avoidance is you know perceived lack of

441
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:51,520
self efficacy alright this is this

442
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:54,340
Scythian feeling that you're just not

443
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,860
good at your job you're not feeling

444
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,490
confident you're asking yourself what

445
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:03,129
you're doing there and this this survey

446
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,540
you know says that you know or the

447
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,050
people are behind the server saying is

448
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:11,110
it begins to erode at the person's

449
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:14,080
perception of their value now I am am i

450
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:19,030
worth anything and the sense of what

451
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:22,419
they're doing is is just not enough so I

452
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,220
think that you know there is some you

453
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,540
know there are things that we can do as

454
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:32,230
individuals to help identify burnout is

455
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:34,870
to to understand what is burnout and

456
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,720
then if there's any you know leaders

457
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,179
here on the call I think there's a

458
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,790
number of ways that we can you know

459
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,210
start to address these things you know

460
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:49,540
looking at our workload

461
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,240
giving people autonomy or choice to get

462
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,250
you know how you get the job done

463
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,750
reward and recognition okay you've heard

464
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,260
me say it a couple times it's very

465
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,540
important even the little things and

466
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,190
then it's not just salary and raises you

467
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,649
know we do want to reward give that

468
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,710
financial incentive but that's not the

469
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,690
only thing that we can do

470
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,220
creating a workplace community very

471
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,580
important especially in your the scope

472
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,980
of nineteen is keeping connected and and

473
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,840
making sure that it's not just you to

474
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,510
your people but your people are talking

475
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,830
with each other and working together

476
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,730
fairness with practices and policies

477
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,439
making sure that they're clearly

478
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,380
articulated so people know what they are

479
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,710
and it's you treat everybody the same

480
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,350
and the values includes including what

481
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,320
makes up an employee makes it makes them

482
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,570
what makes them excited and proud to

483
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,540
come to work so if we can take these

484
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:55,510
things on and I think that we can have a

485
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:56,590
direct impact to to burnout now I want

486
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,270
to talk about the difference between

487
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:04,000
stress versus bright now because stress

488
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:07,420
is going to be there no matter what you

489
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,730
know especially InfoSec we are in you

490
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,500
know it's going on which rolls your

491
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,230
artists operations has a little bit more

492
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,820
stress than somebody like in governance

493
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,150
and whatnot but it's it's still a very

494
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,399
stressful role so you know you know

495
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:26,440
first let's help define stress so stress

496
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,210
is defined as a person response to a

497
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,110
disturbing factor in the environment

498
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:34,560
okay Ally it leads to physical

499
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:38,229
psychological even behavioral divergence

500
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,389
for organizations for individuals inside

501
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,370
of an organization it's it's an

502
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:47,860
important part of our work life

503
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,870
encompasses the interaction between us

504
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,949
in our environment and the stress is

505
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,080
just there and it's it's not always a

506
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,450
bad thing the factors from our

507
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,760
environment which you know cause stress

508
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,370
or your home stressors and the intent

509
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,840
the intensity of the stress is not all

510
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,449
the same for individuals right some

511
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,879
might get highly stressed as they

512
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,100
overreact to stressors while some have

513
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,760
the stamina to cope with that same

514
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:18,129
stressor in general stress you know

515
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,140
seems to be negative but you know has a

516
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,510
positive dimension

517
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,940
when stress is positive is known as

518
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,340
eustress there you go you know if you

519
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,130
take your psychology class you learn

520
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,679
something for today it is it's often

521
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,620
viewed as a motivator right you stress

522
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,650
provides an opportunity for an

523
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,689
individual to gain something the stress

524
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:44,500
is said to be negative when you know

525
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:47,320
women actually impacts our physical body

526
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,810
you know hard element you know

527
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,889
represents itself marital breakdown drug

528
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:55,270
abuse alcoholism so here is kind of a

529
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,930
breakdown of a couple of different

530
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:01,330
things that you can start to pair out

531
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,100
the difference between stress and

532
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,470
burnout and what stress does to us

533
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,840
versus burnout so you know won't go

534
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,950
through and read the entire slide no but

535
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,540
you can see the differences here that

536
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,900
you know stress and burnout can do it

537
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,399
now

538
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,720
stress can be harmful you can still be

539
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,420
completely stressed out and not

540
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,610
experiencing the same things as burnout

541
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,710
and it not be healthy for you so

542
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,919
figuring out what that balance looks

543
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,750
like and understanding the differences

544
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,660
between stress and burnout I think it's

545
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,400
key to identify and and the reason I

546
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,730
bring these up is is I'm trying to

547
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,390
identify you know why somebody might be

548
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,830
unhappy all right so we talked about

549
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,100
stress and burnout let's look at some

550
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:52,199
other things of saying why we might be

551
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,199
unhappy in a particular situation

552
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,340
all right number one is it in the

553
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,860
workplace all right are you challenged

554
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,270
at your job yeah do you get a sense of

555
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,010
the fulfillment these are things that

556
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,190
when you're looking at your unhappiness

557
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,230
could it be that you know you just want

558
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,840
to do something else so is it the job

559
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,570
itself the actual workload that is

560
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,000
making you unhappy that could be a

561
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,620
possible sense of source of your

562
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,450
happiness

563
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,389
is it the people all right do you have a

564
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,280
particular person that you are having

565
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,380
friction with or does it seem to be a

566
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,610
lot of different people and if it's a

567
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,780
lot of different people is it the

568
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:38,929
corporate culture you could be in a

569
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,750
situation that just doesn't fit with

570
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:45,080
your upbringing and just you're having a

571
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:49,400
hard time fitting in had the situation

572
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,399
where I managed a team in Atlanta and we

573
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,890
had the exact same team in Kansas City

574
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,620
now Atlanta there's you know it's a high

575
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,110
tech city lots of people you know

576
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,070
Georgia Tech and ISS and large security

577
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:06,620
folks and and the the culture for most

578
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,379
of people in Atlanta is that people love

579
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,120
their job and if they had a problem they

580
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,760
wanted to solve they would stick around

581
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:19,459
and solve even though this was shift

582
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,379
based work as a 24/7 operation center it

583
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,090
was you know people would go and pass

584
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,670
their shift and and and make sure

585
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:28,129
problems you know that they help solve

586
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:32,480
problems Kansas City on the other hand

587
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,250
they were you know 95 or you know

588
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,440
whatever their shift was they would

589
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,580
ensure that you know they were very good

590
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:45,020
handing things off and and they were

591
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:47,300
staunch defenders of their of their

592
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,670
work-life balance they did their there

593
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,129
eight or nine hours and and then called

594
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,620
it a day and it was very interesting the

595
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,600
friction between the two teams because

596
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:00,739
we're supposed to kind of be working

597
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,449
together and so it was it's fairly early

598
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,700
on in my career kind of help point out

599
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,370
even you know a couple hundred miles

600
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,480
between Atlanta and Kansas City the vast

601
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,219
difference and

602
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,230
culture and you know we obviously work

603
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,140
with teams all over the nation of the

604
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,929
world now and so you know paying

605
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,580
attention that culture is something that

606
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,549
could help open your eyes on why you

607
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,260
might be unhappy

608
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,918
okay absence of trust so this comes up

609
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:34,580
again and so that's that's one thing

610
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:38,020
that we can you know dive into here a

611
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:41,240
little bit later and no character at all

612
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,799
no carrots only six there we go is that

613
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,559
you know you know you're not getting the

614
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,990
recognition you're just getting also

615
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:49,250
it's a negative feedback so we gotta get

616
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,700
a balance of positive and negative

617
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,700
feedback

618
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,679
all right so other sources of

619
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,250
unhappiness could be in the condition of

620
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:07,630
your job all right so is it the commute

621
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:07,630
here in Atlanta Atlanta's got really bad

622
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,710
commute times it's I think it's one of

623
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:16,580
the worst three in the city or in the

624
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:18,080
nation but but even within Atlanta I

625
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,000
have one job that I had to go and it was

626
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,790
all backwards and the stop and go

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,049
backwards was painful and I did not

628
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:32,059
enjoy you know as an hour commute but it

629
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:33,740
seemed like a particularly painful hour

630
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:35,389
because a lot of it was just sitting

631
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:40,250
there waiting for a red light to go it

632
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:41,690
was not enjoyable at all so so that can

633
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,809
provide you know source of unhappiness

634
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:48,140
so but there's something that can easily

635
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:50,149
be identified as the source worker

636
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,049
working hours of uh you know work-life

637
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:55,880
balance you know this is a a particular

638
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:58,340
hot topic for me again because as a

639
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,120
leader and I try to you know control

640
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,699
this for my people

641
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,489
is that you know you've got to make sure

642
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,720
that you are in a place where you you

643
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,640
know enjoy the hours that you work some

644
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,500
people really just love to put in those

645
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,830
those 10-hour days and they don't feel

646
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,169
fulfilled until they do that I don't

647
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,609
think that

648
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:21,080
you know if you're in a position where

649
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,449
you're working too much for a long

650
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,439
period of time is is not healthy and can

651
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,789
lead to that unhappiness its next point

652
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,090
office open office

653
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:34,279
I hear this complaining a good bit

654
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,259
unfortunately I'm not the ultimate

655
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,239
leader so I don't have a whole lot of

656
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,049
say over this and fixing this for my

657
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,059
people

658
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:42,499
but I can definitely understand the

659
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:45,590
stress that comes toward you know

660
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:47,779
working in an open office is that you

661
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:52,609
know when you've got people that really

662
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:54,830
want to be enclosed they don't want you

663
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:56,720
know the constant walking up and having

664
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,299
people interrupt them all the time I can

665
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,950
lead unhappiness so you know can you fix

666
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,509
this by working at home some more I mean

667
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,249
obviously now everybody's working from

668
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:06,440
home and so hopefully that's that's

669
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:08,950
leading to some relief for those people

670
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,659
that really hate that open office

671
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,129
equipment or software are you running

672
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:14,359
five-year-old machine running when

673
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:16,730
there's ninety eight I might be

674
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,559
insensitive stress for you I'm dealing

675
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,139
with red tape and practices another so

676
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,269
so again the whole point of this this

677
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:26,539
lies is so when you're if you feel like

678
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:28,009
you're unhappy and it's not stress or

679
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,980
burnout maybe it's one of these things

680
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:35,899
and so being able to identify these

681
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:39,369
helps you determine is it you know time

682
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:44,268
to leave and if it is time to leave

683
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:46,879
where do you want to go but before we go

684
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:52,129
into that topic let's talk about my hard

685
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:54,609
lines these are you know a lot of

686
00:31:52,129 --> 00:32:00,619
different studies and toxic workplaces

687
00:31:54,609 --> 00:32:04,699
is a situation where I found that any of

688
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:06,649
these these things are present it's it's

689
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,559
you know it either needs to be fixed or

690
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:11,629
I need to move on and you need to find

691
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:14,629
those for yourself so that you can

692
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:17,959
understand when you do not get stuck in

693
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:19,519
situation that you need to put up with

694
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,289
these side things so well I could

695
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,259
transfer see now this one doesn't sound

696
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:27,430
bad right lack of transparency but what

697
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,590
I'm talking about here is

698
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:35,740
the not knowing how you're being

699
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:37,360
measured and seeing that measure SiC be

700
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,440
a different length for different people

701
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,000
all right you are getting fussed at for

702
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,340
something that you know somebody else

703
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,040
gets you know does the same thing and

704
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,370
they they do not give us that you know

705
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,670
and those type of things where you don't

706
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:57,280
know what your expectations are you

707
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:00,940
can't be successful in that and so if

708
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:05,170
you and and the other point along this

709
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:08,320
topic is is around the people you know

710
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,940
being shifted around moving moving from

711
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,470
different roles to different role and

712
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:18,820
and management is not forthright with

713
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,300
what's going on and obviously since I've

714
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:26,110
been on both sides you know I think

715
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,649
that's a big crime I would I would say

716
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,990
that this is one of the hard lines

717
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:35,080
chronic overworked so talked about this

718
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:38,830
a little bit before but you know if if

719
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,428
you were constantly working 50 60 hour

720
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:45,220
weeks that is a failure of leadership to

721
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:46,480
staff appropriately and it's not

722
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,700
something that you should put up with

723
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,630
for a long period of time there's some

724
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,950
exceptions to this and notably is you

725
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,240
know startups and we'll talk about that

726
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,120
in a bit

727
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,390
and and you know you might think hey I'm

728
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,629
young in my career I need to you know

729
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:08,379
cut my teeth and and and yeah this is

730
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:10,720
expected and and no abusing your

731
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,929
employees is not expected just because

732
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,299
you are you know in an entry-level

733
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,659
position does not mean that you need to

734
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:23,260
work 80 hour weeks and get paid for 40

735
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:26,260
so everybody should stand up and insist

736
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,700
that this is another problem now we're

737
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,379
all going to have those situations where

738
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,500
we will have 80 hour weeks there's

739
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:34,299
security incidents things that break we

740
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,060
got to fix it you know lots of reasons

741
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,470
to have a stress where we can do some

742
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,320
overworking I'm talking about you know

743
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:44,790
overtime

744
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,580
every week is not acceptable next point

745
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,429
narcissists and bullies okay

746
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,500
these the narcissists are people that

747
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,700
you know care only about themselves

748
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,910
bullies are statistics statistics

749
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,350
sadistic people that are looking to you

750
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,230
know that really get pleasure out of

751
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:06,000
abusing other people and these people

752
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,660
are poisonous

753
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,210
they're toxic and says a lot about an

754
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,129
organization if that is the person if

755
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:20,580
that person is able to survive I will

756
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,860
say that you know there seems to be a

757
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,290
couple of these in most large

758
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:29,360
organizations I still don't understand

759
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:31,770
how they keep their job and and but they

760
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:36,150
generally these type of people are very

761
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:41,460
smart about how their clinical evil and

762
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:44,310
it's very annoying so if you cannot move

763
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,910
out of that role and not be reporting to

764
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:50,670
that you know narcissistic boss then you

765
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,560
know moving to another another job don't

766
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,530
wait around for the organization to

767
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,299
figure out that this is a bad guy now

768
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,820
not to say that you shouldn't take

769
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,080
things up with HR always take that route

770
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,990
of you if there's a particular

771
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,730
individual you know open the open ones

772
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,589
communication with HR and see if you can

773
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,360
do anything there might be other you

774
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,970
know other people that are afraid to go

775
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,460
to HR and you might be the one to be

776
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:19,230
able to help get one of these

777
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,970
narcissists out of the organization next

778
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,440
topic is the back-channel backstabbing

779
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,200
so this is a situation where everything

780
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,780
seems to be normal everything seems to

781
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,779
be good nobody is fussing or yelling at

782
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:36,570
each other but but in the you know on on

783
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,060
a slack or Instant Messenger everybody's

784
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,740
just typing away talking bad about the

785
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,100
leaders talking bad about other people

786
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,430
you know lots of negative gossiping this

787
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:50,279
is a telltale sign of a toxic workplace

788
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,169
it's it goes to lack of trust in your

789
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,809
your people

790
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:59,650
of communication and and people fill in

791
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:02,230
the gap with negativity and last one is

792
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:08,230
a big one hate is tolerated this is all

793
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:12,880
of your isms racism sexism ageism you

794
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:15,490
know true truly hateful people again

795
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,530
like the Marshall system bullies still

796
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:20,308
seem to be able to thrive in some

797
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:24,390
organizations and if that type of

798
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:27,670
negativity is not dealt with by your HR

799
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:31,000
then that is not a company that you

800
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:34,210
shouldn't be a part of and and you know

801
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,690
it might even be like for the folks in

802
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,549
different West Coast organizations that

803
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,940
stood up and and and went public with

804
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:45,520
that you know that we need to be able to

805
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,859
hold people accountable this really goes

806
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,770
2020 we should not have to be dealing

807
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,779
with this kind of stuff in our workplace

808
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,940
anymore and sad that we still do so

809
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,829
hardline for me all right

810
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:02,020
so I'm kind of talked about some

811
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:04,000
different you know things that could be

812
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,470
making you happy things that could be

813
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,200
you know hard life for you and you've

814
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,930
decided yes I want to move on let's look

815
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,089
at where you could possibly move on to

816
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,259
and so this is where you know hopefully

817
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:15,430
bring my experience and different

818
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,619
working with different companies that

819
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:20,649
kind of help you understand some of the

820
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:23,500
experiences that you might get I find

821
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:27,549
that the security department of these

822
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,369
different size companies is works a lot

823
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:32,710
different ISO start-up unless the

824
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:36,099
security unless the startup itself is

825
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,410
about security likelihood is that you

826
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:41,710
will not have a specific security job

827
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,649
and the startup this is startups usually

828
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,420
used in virtual CISOs and consultants to

829
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,710
kind of come in and do security for them

830
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,200
but there's not going to be a security

831
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,210
position you know there's an exception

832
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,618
to that rule I'm sure but in general if

833
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,670
you're going to be working for start-up

834
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:58,960
it's probably gonna be a security

835
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:01,119
startup it's a lot of fun but that with

836
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,130
startups and you know the last boat

837
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,250
they're starting on business is that you

838
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,089
know expect to to be putting in lots of

839
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,239
hours

840
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:11,710
you you exchange something for either

841
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,279
starting on business or joining a

842
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:17,859
start-up you do not get paid as much but

843
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:19,719
the passion is there the reason that

844
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:23,769
you're there is to help build something

845
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:26,440
build a company that is very important

846
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:28,238
to you and and that passion is usually

847
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,299
shared by everyone that's on the team

848
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:34,390
and it translates them too often you

849
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:35,950
know very long hours because because

850
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,279
everybody you know really wants to see

851
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:42,279
it succeed so so go in there with wise

852
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:43,499
wide open if you get the it I would say

853
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,549
if you get the opportunity to do this

854
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:48,129
just make sure that you're in a good

855
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,049
place where you can help support that

856
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,180
passion that's not going to negatively

857
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:55,269
impact your family your spouse or

858
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,649
anything along those lines you know so

859
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:59,468
small company is that you know as it

860
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,160
gets bigger like I said I joined you

861
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:05,650
know I told you time to joining bit 9

862
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,180
when they're about 150 people I did the

863
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:12,609
same thing early in the 2000s with a

864
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:15,219
consulting house and train company and

865
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:17,589
and these these are can be a lot of fun

866
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:19,509
you're gonna wear lots of hats you're

867
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:21,308
probably going to be an IT guy that also

868
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:24,190
does security or a security guy that

869
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:26,859
mostly does IT you know the type of

870
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:32,430
people that just focus on supporting the

871
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:35,019
company is a few and far between and so

872
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,868
if you're the type of person that wants

873
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:42,959
to kind of run it all working for a

874
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:45,219
small company is is a good place to be

875
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,069
medium sized company once you hit about

876
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:50,979
thousand employees somewhere between 500

877
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:55,630
to a thousand employees companies start

878
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:57,430
to trans transfer in or move into this

879
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,049
you know taking the 30-hour large

880
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,379
company and so you start getting a lot

881
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:04,119
more specialization you know usually at

882
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,579
this point you know company's going to

883
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,579
pick us see so or you know have some

884
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:11,229
type of senior leader security and and

885
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:14,440
that the security needs that that

886
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:18,489
company is going to start to have a

887
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,980
fully fledged security department but

888
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:23,440
also expect to be wearing lots of hats

889
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,900
I really like working for these size

890
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,160
companies the reason is is that you you

891
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,310
generally have some pretty decent

892
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,009
budgets you can buy lots of toys but

893
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,750
then but then you also get to play with

894
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,609
lots of different toys there's not the

895
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:40,180
Ebor specialization that you get in the

896
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:42,609
larger companies and so I was a security

897
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,879
director for a company that had about

898
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:48,130
1,500 employees you know it was great

899
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,010
because I could go from working on

900
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,990
secure coding with the programmers to

901
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,720
vulnerability management to Incident

902
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,339
Response and you know and even as a

903
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,399
Security Director I was able to kind of

904
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,830
you know see all the different areas now

905
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,080
as we move into the larger company

906
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:07,509
you're looking at a much different

907
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,450
experience you start getting into the

908
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,580
kind of uber specialization I work for a

909
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:16,839
company now that is about 90,000

910
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:19,090
employees and and so we have you know

911
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:24,730
specific teams to do you know just data

912
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:26,380
protection just DLP just encryption just

913
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:31,119
you know so that you're able to like

914
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:33,940
focus on a very slim area of security

915
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,670
and this is a great to become like seven

916
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,530
uber expert in a particular field also

917
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,980
working for these large companies give

918
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:44,970
you a chance to to move between

919
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:48,640
different roles so very often I

920
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:50,799
encourage my people that report to me if

921
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,990
they you know to move on every year so

922
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,820
into something else if they want to to

923
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,850
be able to you know get the experience

924
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:00,100
of going from becoming a tools

925
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,950
administrator to an engineer to an

926
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,990
architect those type of things

927
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,669
all right now working for a security

928
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,740
company is not the only way of doing

929
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:13,510
this right you a security vendor is also

930
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:15,520
a great place to move into what's great

931
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:18,490
about working for you know a security

932
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,859
vendor is that if you are not the Ober

933
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,500
technical type let's say that you like

934
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:26,410
writing blogging or social media you

935
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,850
like you know sales and marketing on you

936
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,920
know you can be in the security world

937
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:33,339
and do those type of non-technical

938
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,530
things and so if you're if your

939
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,330
parachute is of a different color

940
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,040
but you still enjoy the security world

941
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,910
reach out there for those security

942
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,440
vendors now security vendors also have a

943
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,750
tend to have a bigger aptitude for being

944
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,060
able to work remote they tend to pave a

945
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,610
little bit better but you also are

946
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,950
probably going to be bought out and go

947
00:43:51,610 --> 00:44:00,400
and work for one of the big then there's

948
00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:03,189
like Broadcom or IBM and or Cisco and so

949
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,050
I kind of expect if you put any time as

950
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,710
a vendor you will go through a merger

951
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:11,110
and acquisition security integrators and

952
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,750
resellers this is a you know companies

953
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:17,440
like Optive but there's also small and

954
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,940
mom-and-pop resellers that are really

955
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,900
fulfilling I did this for a couple of

956
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:24,610
years and and so you know that your

957
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,140
experience and it's gonna be a lot

958
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,900
different if you work for a smaller

959
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,120
integrator then you do with these the

960
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,070
bigger shops the bigger shops are gonna

961
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,020
feel a lot more like third boat there

962
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,780
which is the consulting shop and and

963
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,820
consulting is definitely a different

964
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,220
beast if you work for a consulting shop

965
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,900
you know and and sometimes even as

966
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,980
resellers you're you know you're the

967
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,530
profit right you're you're that you're

968
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,810
the revenue generator and so you need to

969
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,600
be out there in a billable mode which

970
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,630
means there's there's a lot of work

971
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,490
there it can be a lot of travel and but

972
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,240
you also get a wide variety of

973
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,319
experience this is what I did when I

974
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,279
about half of what I did when I was at

975
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:11,500
IBM is I traveled the world being

976
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,410
consultant for lots of very large

977
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:17,950
different companies and and it was a

978
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:22,000
great experience so but know that like I

979
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:24,549
said with the high demands of work and

980
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,950
high demand of travel even though that

981
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:29,050
we're not traveling right now if you're

982
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:32,680
looking at moving into consulting make

983
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,690
sure that you can understand that going

984
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,940
in that again that you're at a good

985
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:40,720
place where you know travels I can be

986
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:43,350
detrimental to family or whatever your

987
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,350
situation is

988
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,560
managed to carry brighter that's another

989
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,660
good one where we hire a lot of people

990
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,500
that have been worked for you know IBM

991
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:56,690
slash is us here in Atlanta it's a it's

992
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,369
a good way of kind of mixing both worlds

993
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,890
you have a situation where you are

994
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:02,900
providing security for somebody else but

995
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:06,200
you get to do you know some of the more

996
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,240
blue team type stuff and and work in a

997
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,939
sock but get a wide variety of

998
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,529
experience and then end up in a

999
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,240
consultant so there's the times in

1000
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:16,400
between the jobs now as an independent

1001
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,759
insulting I basically used LinkedIn as a

1002
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,920
sales tool basically turning myself on

1003
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,510
as available I get flooded with people

1004
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,109
saying hey you want to do this you want

1005
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:29,480
to do that so this you know are it's

1006
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:32,240
commonly referred to as gig economy is

1007
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,609
can be very lucrative I made a lot of

1008
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,910
money but then that also went with times

1009
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:39,410
where I did not work and so going into

1010
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,819
either starting your own business or

1011
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,569
independent consulting you have to be

1012
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:47,150
able to plan for times where you're not

1013
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:49,880
gonna be making money for example it

1014
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:53,080
might take a month or two to get a

1015
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,020
contract in place and then they've got

1016
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:59,240
net 30 or net 60 terms which means they

1017
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,119
won't pay you for your work so you work

1018
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,830
for a month you build them you don't get

1019
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,390
paid for another month or two months so

1020
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:10,220
you can see how this could be a large

1021
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:11,779
gap of getting revenue in so there's

1022
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,490
business loans that can help cover that

1023
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,950
gap but you need to be make sure to plan

1024
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:19,009
for that all right so there's some

1025
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:21,410
colors of the types of companies let's

1026
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,730
talk about different roles and so I'll

1027
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,740
go through a couple of these will read

1028
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,869
the entire slide will preview for

1029
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:31,009
writing a slide deck for everyone on

1030
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:35,990
both the schedule page and if it works

1031
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:39,050
out on discord so the sake analyst or

1032
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:40,520
security operations so this is looking

1033
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,440
at these types of roles like stock

1034
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,859
analyst and this in response you're

1035
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,170
going to be typically a work typically a

1036
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:49,700
shift worker so that means that you

1037
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,940
could be working second or third shift

1038
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,999
and that might change so so be prepared

1039
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,559
for that

1040
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:57,779
the type of job there is typically

1041
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,669
process and procedure driven is that

1042
00:47:57,779 --> 00:48:02,369
you're going to be given you know you

1043
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:05,699
need to do every time that this button

1044
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:09,239
comes up you need to do XY and Z and

1045
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:11,519
very prescriptive it's good for you know

1046
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:13,349
grateful places that were your

1047
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,948
entry-level and you're learning and you

1048
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:19,739
don't you know necessarily could not

1049
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:20,579
self-drive but but that you know it's

1050
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:23,939
not for everyone

1051
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:26,489
that you gotta understand that the that

1052
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:30,959
those type of process and procedure

1053
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:34,469
driven jobs is a it's for a particular

1054
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:37,319
type of people Security Administration

1055
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:40,469
so this is security engineering tools

1056
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:41,909
production support your this is these

1057
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:45,079
type of people were going to probably

1058
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:47,369
work a day shift but carry a pager

1059
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:49,169
pagers are little things that you know

1060
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:51,269
for you young kids that you've probably

1061
00:48:49,169 --> 00:48:55,429
never had but you'll be on non call

1062
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:57,899
rotation and so okay expect that

1063
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:58,949
interrupt-driven work you probably are

1064
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:00,299
going to be doing your own little

1065
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:03,599
projects you're going to be improving

1066
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:05,819
stuff upgrading doing stuff they keep

1067
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,699
the tools running but it's an interrupt

1068
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,558
driven job you kind of work normal until

1069
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,969
something breaks you get a ticket in you

1070
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,069
get a call

1071
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:16,829
it's interrupt-driven job so it's a

1072
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:18,869
different mode of working security

1073
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:23,279
architecture and sometimes in

1074
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:25,229
engineering as well is you have you know

1075
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:28,109
typically standard hours this type of

1076
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:31,169
job is very project driven and so you're

1077
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:34,439
you're always working toward either a

1078
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:36,089
sprint or you know a milestone or

1079
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:38,219
something along those lines and project

1080
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:39,808
management terms and and the work is

1081
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:41,339
very different from somebody this

1082
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:43,499
interrupt-driven so I kind of want to

1083
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,819
drive that home is that you know if

1084
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:47,519
you're going into a role try to figure

1085
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:51,359
out the modality of how the job actually

1086
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:54,209
works threat intelligence you know this

1087
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,689
is a job and I also got later threat

1088
00:49:54,209 --> 00:50:00,209
hunter very similar is you know I've

1089
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:05,009
seen it both standard you know nine to

1090
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:07,299
five or sometimes if work is but it's

1091
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:11,160
research driven so you get

1092
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:14,020
you know you you are chasing down ideas

1093
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,270
thoughts you know you've got something

1094
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,850
that you want to you've got a hypothesis

1095
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:21,520
or you want to prove or not these type

1096
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:23,110
of jobs are research of and so I said

1097
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,780
I've got a couple slides here that have

1098
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:28,060
a couple of different roles like this

1099
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,070
and you know looking at the different

1100
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,140
modalities of these jobs like I said I

1101
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:35,260
won't go through every single one here's

1102
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:37,299
a couple more call out you know

1103
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,880
governance governance is a great place

1104
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,550
for people that really feel that

1105
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,460
security operations might be too

1106
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,260
stressful

1107
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,970
typically governance roles are you know

1108
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,520
you get to do some you know third party

1109
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:55,180
risk management policy governance

1110
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,000
writing policies and and guidances and

1111
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:00,790
going through those type of risk

1112
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,260
management models you've got business

1113
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,890
experience or that's something that you

1114
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:08,620
really you know you know are interested

1115
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:11,080
in governance is a great place to get

1116
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,960
some it's another good good entry point

1117
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,220
into security and it's also a good place

1118
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,080
to give a lot of different varied

1119
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,370
experience because of the different

1120
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,790
places that you could be interacting

1121
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:23,859
with as governance and like I said it's

1122
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:27,520
it's it's usually either a project

1123
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:30,610
driven or interrupt driven according the

1124
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,790
roll and then audit is another kind of

1125
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:36,970
you know different animal auditors tend

1126
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:41,980
to be it's a much more detailed oriented

1127
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:45,100
role and and it's something that you

1128
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,510
know is you know a lot of people use it

1129
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,060
as an entry point to get into security

1130
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:51,580
but it's something that I would say is

1131
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:54,130
it's definitely you know got a different

1132
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:57,160
you know flavor or taste have been the

1133
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:59,410
rest of the these but it's a great way

1134
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,520
to kind of get in and get a lot of very

1135
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:05,980
good experience so I do love my auditors

1136
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:09,130
and a couple more here I'm sake of time

1137
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,400
I'm just going to glance over and and

1138
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,990
move on to one of my favorite books like

1139
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,050
said is the what color is your parachute

1140
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:19,479
so if you are seriously considering

1141
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,859
moving jobs or even if you want to

1142
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,819
figure out that

1143
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:27,098
how you work and and would like to work

1144
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:28,930
pick up this book it's not very big book

1145
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:33,819
there's lots of different editions you

1146
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:36,549
can have the I think there's a twenty20

1147
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:38,200
I'm sure there's probably one for like

1148
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:40,420
technical work

1149
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,009
I didn't look closely there may even be

1150
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,170
one for information security but they're

1151
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:47,859
all basically the same the idea is to

1152
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:50,529
figure out how you how the actually the

1153
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,900
realities of the job are and what is

1154
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:54,970
something that you would like to do and

1155
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,269
this to me

1156
00:52:54,970 --> 00:53:02,709
translates into a lot more happiness and

1157
00:52:57,269 --> 00:53:05,140
career success then having a you know

1158
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:08,410
being the most technical being the

1159
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:11,259
smartest being the you know personal

1160
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:14,788
with the most followers you know those

1161
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:19,599
are not my goals my goals are to find

1162
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:23,019
you know jobs to me that fit my modality

1163
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:26,950
of what I like so on the graphic here is

1164
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:28,660
is from that book you can see you know

1165
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,819
it's this is one of the worksheets that

1166
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,190
takes you through and you can see the

1167
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:36,430
kind of things that it's it's gonna have

1168
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:40,029
you write out and and then you can take

1169
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:43,239
this and then look at the different job

1170
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:44,950
categories and figure out you know yes

1171
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,380
oh I'd love to be able to be a sock

1172
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:50,019
analyst well you know is the reality of

1173
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,960
what a sock analyst does besides the

1174
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:54,279
fact that it's young pays well is it the

1175
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,739
type of job that's gonna keep you happy

1176
00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:58,450
is if you're not happy you know back to

1177
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:00,970
those seven people seven reasons why

1178
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:03,189
people quit if it's not fulfilling it's

1179
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:06,069
not challenging you if it makes you so

1180
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:10,319
unhappy and so stressed the money is not

1181
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:13,150
worth it so how do you find happiness so

1182
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:16,569
you know a happiness is something that

1183
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,499
you have to go back is you have to

1184
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:23,069
constantly you know be seeking happiness

1185
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:26,558
and so the ways that you can do that

1186
00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:28,749
self reward don't necessarily wait on

1187
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,869
your leaders to get to give you your own

1188
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:33,879
rewards you know you can you know what

1189
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:34,690
you've done you know what you've done

1190
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,400
and

1191
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:39,490
you know give yourself some incentive

1192
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,300
reward yourself on an ongoing basis this

1193
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:46,118
is very important responsibility so we

1194
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:49,089
are entitled to ourselves before anyone

1195
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,520
else a happy employee is always willing

1196
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:55,480
to take charge of his or actions and

1197
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,130
proactively engage his or their skills

1198
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,990
and this it's that's that's very

1199
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:05,440
important too for seeking happiness job

1200
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:09,640
satisfaction is a savior yep

1201
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,500
Hey how we doing on you have much more I

1202
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:15,040
hate to interrupt but second to last

1203
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:17,770
slide all right wrap it up so job

1204
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,690
satisfaction is often you know mistake

1205
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:21,759
to be the same as workplace happiness

1206
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,609
but I believe that there's two different

1207
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,700
and finally a cognitive awareness and

1208
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:30,670
flow and the same time won't skip over

1209
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,589
that but you know I I think that in the

1210
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:37,869
end finding happiness is something that

1211
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:39,569
we have to ensure that you are actively

1212
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:44,530
seeking on an ongoing basis

1213
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:46,420
so to summarize here so how can you

1214
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:50,260
redefine failure make sure that you

1215
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:53,950
understand that what has been successful

1216
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:56,200
for you and what is not and understand

1217
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,578
that probably the things that you might

1218
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,730
have considered failures in your life

1219
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:01,750
are just learning experiences and and

1220
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,230
shock there's up to wins

1221
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:07,060
make make those a success for learning

1222
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,450
that this is not the type of job that

1223
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,369
you want um so you are not alone out

1224
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,930
there you know there's a lot of people

1225
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,780
that are stressed about the same things

1226
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:19,990
that you're stressed about and don't let

1227
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:24,220
that be the reason alone to move to a

1228
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:25,689
new role avoid you know stress then and

1229
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,169
make sure you do not does not lead to

1230
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:31,359
burnout and and if you are unhappy try

1231
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,880
to find the source of that unhappiness

1232
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:36,700
and be you know maybe you can fix it or

1233
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,790
or or shift it in some way that you

1234
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:42,339
don't have to change roles look before

1235
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:44,200
you leap and and when you do know

1236
00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:45,460
yourself before you leap there so that

1237
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,750
you know what the color of your

1238
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,670
parachute is and what's going to make

1239
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,369

1244
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,549

1246
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:09,819
and have a good day yet before you jump

1247
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:11,470
off we do have a few questions I think

1248
00:57:09,819 --> 00:57:13,839
you mentioned on you you might be

1249
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:16,959
uploading the slides to the the sked I

1250
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:19,078
will get that uploaded yep and so when

1251
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,329
we open up my discord here

1252
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:25,780
so besides Knoxville so the the the

1253
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:27,940
discord has an 8 meg file limit okay I

1254
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:32,410
should be good I think it's gonna count

1255
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:36,160
out most most slide decks but sched

1256
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:41,558
should be fine to upload attendees

1257
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:45,009
besides Knoxville 2020 dot s CH Edie

1258
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:47,020
comm sked comm that's how I'm choosing

1259
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,859
to pronounce it it might be wrong but

1260
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:52,450
that's what I'm doing and and we do have

1261
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:56,020
yes so a few quick questions here I

1262
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:58,180
think we have time for Shenmue gum asks

1263
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:00,369
how how would you advise on getting

1264
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:04,210
higher up in the layers without being a

1265
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:05,890
manager how to tune one's career in

1266
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,530
situations where you get exposed to

1267
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,660
every technology but only a short amount

1268
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,599
of time due to the changing nature of

1269
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:15,098
the job yeah and that's that's a lot of

1270
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,559
times you'll get that in either smaller

1271
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:22,359
organizations or in the consulting roles

1272
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:24,280
and it is you know to me I just did that

1273
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,140
shift is where I spent probably about 10

1274
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,640
15 years and these consulting so I was

1275
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,680
going from job to job to job and saying

1276
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,009
you know hold on I'm gonna move out of

1277
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,259
the vendor world and go back to you know

1278
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,059
working for a company and so if I'm

1279
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:40,299
moving into you know those type of roles

1280
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:42,609
for a larger company I'm able to stay in

1281
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:45,130
one place for a lot longer and to me

1282
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:47,619
that's where I met my wife has given me

1283
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,119
more happiness now that I can you know

1284
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:52,000
stick around and build something as

1285
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,619
opposed to the all the different

1286
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,809
experiences that you get with consulting

1287
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:58,839
and so yeah I would look for you know a

1288
00:58:55,809 --> 00:59:01,340
role you know say maybe with truest just

1289
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:04,700
saying possibility

1290
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,920
yes I've seen larger organizations that

1291
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,600
have like a distinguished engineer route

1292
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,810
where you can go a technical route up

1293
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,720
the chain yeah this thing was engineered

1294
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:17,180
IBM term but uh but yeah those those

1295
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,950
that is definitely something that you

1296
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:22,160
should look for if you would like to

1297
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:25,279
stick around at a company so in a

1298
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:29,060
situation where you feel singled out the

1299
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,330
environments toxic your managers don't

1300
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,670
have your back when when is it time to

1301
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:38,060
leave versus sticking it out like how

1302
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:40,850
far do you stick it out before jumping

1303
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:43,000
yeah it's being able to like when you

1304
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:46,190
identify and if you're able to identify

1305
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,540
