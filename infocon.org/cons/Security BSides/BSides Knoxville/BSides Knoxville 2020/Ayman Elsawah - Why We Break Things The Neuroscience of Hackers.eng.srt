1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:13,469
yes and it sits right at 1:00 p.m. so I

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:16,710
will I will let you get started here we

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,130
have with us a man Elsa watt I say that

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,160
right yeah yeah

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,619
at the the and the reason I can do that

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,470
is Amon has a podcast called getting

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,448
into InfoSec and I was able to go there

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,219
and repeatedly listen to him say his

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,640
name so I wouldn't screw it up yeah yeah

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,770
yeah my name is a challenge so I put in

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,450
a little bit of extra effort there to

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,890
make sure that I say other people's

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,530
names correctly without further ado this

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,420
is our keynote and Eamonn take it away

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,660
whenever you're ready all right

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,280
hi everyone thank you for coming to this

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,599
I'm really excited to be here I'm really

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,519
grateful to the organizers for inviting

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,770
me I am going to talk about why we break

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:14,700
things as hackers right the neuroscience

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:17,100
of hackers so let's get right into it so

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,400
a little about me I run cloud security

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,890
labs and what I do is I help startups

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,270
and CTOs and founders with their

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,680
security and kind of getting their

26
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:32,070
security act in order but I'm also

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,420
really into a coffee sorry I'm really

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,399
passionate about coffee as well you

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,430
might have seen this so I'm happy to

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
talk about coffee single origin coffee

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,490
Austin so if this is my actual set at

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,490
home and I've started putting it up here

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,850
in my office so I'm really passionate

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,679
about coffee but I also run a podcast

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,798
called getting into InfoSec and what I

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,829
do there is I ask people how they got

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,890
into the field so that we and others can

38
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,360
learn and be inspired of of all the

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,219
different paths that they got into the

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,130
field so that we could learn and be

41
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,829
inspired in and and take that home with

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,359
us I also wrote a book so it's kind of

43
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,390
like my own guide if we sat down for

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,410
coffee and what I would recommend on

45
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,619
step-by-step approach because there's

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,230
some

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,269
stuff out there so you know this is kind

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,909
of like a methodical approach to you

49
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,690
know going from zero to hero and I'm

50
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:27,149
really into sci-fi I'm a bit of a nerd

51
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,760
that I found out recently I enjoy

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,440
gardening family and on Fridays I like

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,420
to wear Hawaiian shirts so as you can

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,930
see it is Friday and I'm wearing a

55
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,929
Hawaiian shirt

56
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,379
so why neuropsychology well you know for

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,879
quite some time I've been you know

58
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,819
studying psychology ever since high

59
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,310
school and one time I one point I was

60
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,369
gifted these two books and you know

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,910
these books were kind of really pivotal

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,700
in my learning and you know predictably

63
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,159
rationale was you know about behavioral

64
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,750
science and behavioral economics and it

65
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,400
was really an interesting book kind of

66
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,709
opened my world but before that I had I

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,840
was given the book harnessing complexity

68
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,530
and it made me learn about complex

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,819
adaptive systems and just understanding

70
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,829
complex systems in many different ways

71
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,578
and I found that book really eye-opening

72
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,859
as well and so you know ever since then

73
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,079
and and as of lately my hobbies have

74
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,090
been like emotional intelligence

75
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,069
education psychology which is a I don't

76
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,200
even know existed and cognitive

77
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,470
neuroscience so these are just some

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,599
hobbies and again as a nerd you know you

79
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,769
might also relate to this as well you

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,540
know when you find something you kind of

81
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,410
just like keep going and keep going down

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,440
and thanks to my bro for gifting me

83
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,198
these books a long time ago the thanks a

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,109
lot buddy so enough about me this is

85
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,599
about you right so what do we know about

86
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,780
hackers right well we know that we'd

87
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,869
like to break things okay we also like

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,849
to build things as well and we are

89
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,699
really curious but we do definitely like

90
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,339
to question things as well right so I

91
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:13,169
think that describes hackers for the

92
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,730
most part wouldn't you say well but you

93
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,489
know is it all we know about hackers

94
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,728
right what but you know why are we like

95
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,768
this

96
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:24,000
you know why we like this this is

97
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,340
something that was kind of getting to me

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,220
as I was you know going on my journey

99
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,260
and

100
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,900
so you know we like this because we are

101
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,260
exposed to tech early on or maybe we had

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,969
a privileged upbringing or maybe we were

103
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,180
exposed to science and math early on

104
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,590
right yeah no that's not that's not why

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,840
we're like this right I going to present

106
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,030
to you after talking with a lot of my

107
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,909
guests and editing them you know when

108
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,260
you're editing an interview you're kind

109
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,180
of reconnecting with that person all

110
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,640
over again because when you're in the

111
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,930
moment in interview it's it's so hard to

112
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,460
grasp a lot of information but when you

113
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,140
editing in and you hear the little

114
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,060
things it's like having that

115
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,030
conversation deeper conversation with

116
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,460
that person but so in my travels and

117
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,190
talking to folks in hallways and and

118
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,780
things like that I've come to learn a

119
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,770
lot and I'm going to share some of this

120
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:22,200
with you and so what I've come to find

121
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,090
are that hackers have these three major

122
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:32,890
qualities and that's the entrepreneurial

123
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:34,929
spirit okay grit and creativity and I

124
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,130
come to find this and I'm pretty

125
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,930
satisfied with this and I've talked

126
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,360
about this before and a lot of people

127
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,400
can agree on this but I was not just

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,160
satisfied with this I kind of wanted to

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,080
go deep and you know if you're like me

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,450
when you find something you just kind of

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,789
keep scratching and scratching and you

132
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,219
just keep wanting to go down so I went

133
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,100
deep and I kind of got lost along the

134
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,750
way I found one research paper and that

135
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,180
paper led to another paper and then

136
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,280
there was another and and it just kept

137
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,340
on going and I'm like what is going on

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,049
and I'm like what is going on here like

139
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,510
I was just totally amazed so I had to

140
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,120
stop I Wayne got some coffee took a

141
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,190
break but then I ended up finding more

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,050
papers and more papers and and more

143
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,760
terminology and I was like what is going

144
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:24,610
on so it was quite profound for me I had

145
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,780
a really good time but and so now I'm

146
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,700
going to share some of this stuff with

147
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:34,929
you and so it's neuroscience time this

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:38,260
is your brain okay it is about an

149
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,660
average about three pounds and it has

150
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,430
about 86 billion neurons

151
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,350
and you know it's divided into these

152
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,550
different parts as you can see here

153
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:52,810
right so sure but then we all know that

154
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,060
oh sorry wrong button we all know that

155
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,090
the brain is divided into the left and

156
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,700
right brain right so we have the

157
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,210
creativity side that's on the right and

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,159
the analytical side on the left I think

159
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,930
everybody that's what everybody thinks

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
right well I'm here to tell you that

161
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,120
that's wrong that is completely wrong

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,490
you should not think of this anymore you

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,710
just stop and that's it and this is dr.

164
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,450
Barry Kaufman saying that exact same

165
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,710
thing just like you shouldn't be telling

166
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,340
people to change their passwords every

167
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,979
90 days the same thing but what is it

168
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,020
about well it's about brain networks so

169
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,420
all the different nodes all those 86

170
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,820
billion neurons have different are

171
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,390
divided into different nodes in the

172
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,040
brain and they form brain networks and

173
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,370
here's a sample of a bunch of networks

174
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,410
that are here and so this is what we're

175
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,390
learning and and the the field of

176
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,310
neuroscience is going through a

177
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,900
renaissance actually with all the

178
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,450
digital imaging that's available now

179
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,609
we're learning a lot more about this

180
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,650
piece of engineering then we have ever

181
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,720
learned before so there's still a lot to

182
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,549
be learned there's still a lot we don't

183
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,770
know these are all a lot of these are

184
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,520
hypotheses and theories about how this

185
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:09,039
stuff works but it's very exciting and

186
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,719
what's really interesting is I found a

187
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,970
lot of terms that were similar from

188
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,169
neuroscience and networking and I'm

189
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,790
gonna share this with you right now so

190
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,039
for example the brain networks we just

191
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,380
talked about I literally found this

192
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,380
image and these two images and they look

193
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,360
almost exactly the same so that that's

194
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,820
quite interesting but there's also

195
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,910
something called the default Network and

196
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,720
the default network is the network in

197
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,890
your brain that is at a resting state so

198
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,210
[Music]

199
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,650
that's the part of the network of your

200
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,800
brain a resting state where you're not

201
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,160
really doing major tasks and of course

202
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,300
we all know about the default route but

203
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,000
then there's also something called the

204
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,760
global efficiency factor so it's the

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,070
number of nodes or paths that have to be

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,580
taken in your brain and I literally did

207
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,550
a cut

208
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,040
tastes from here and just changed pair

209
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:03,010
of network never pair of brain regions

210
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,780
two pair of network nodes and I found

211
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,689
this quite profound and there's some

212
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,670
other terms along the way that I found

213
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,520
really similar but I just wanted to

214
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,550
share that with you and so let's talk

215
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,590
about the first subject entrepreneurship

216
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:22,000
so what do you think when you hear about

217
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,340
entrepreneurship do you think about

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,240
these people for example well

219
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,520
entrepreneurs are not only these people

220
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,840
but they're also these people as well

221
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,699
and so you know entrepreneurs there's an

222
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,530
entrepreneurial spirit that that that

223
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,980
willingness to do something different

224
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,350
the willingness to persevere to to

225
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,910
explore and find things that are

226
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,370
different these are also all

227
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,339
entrepreneurs as well they have that

228
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:56,070
entrepreneurial spirit so this is

229
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,070
something to relate to to understand

230
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,820
when you're trying to think about being

231
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,829
a hacker or when you are when you think

232
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,060
of yourself as a hacker but what really

233
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,070
makes yourself what makes an

234
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:11,709
entrepreneur tick so let's get into it

235
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:15,640
so there's a part of the brain called

236
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:19,180
the angular cingulate cortex and what's

237
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,040
really interesting here is that in

238
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,959
entrepreneurship what you're looking to

239
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,800
do is to explore to do different things

240
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,360
but then you're gonna hit failure and

241
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,430
the idea is that you will learn from

242
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,040
that failure so some entrepreneurs are

243
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,359
the successful ones we hear about their

244
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,829
successes but we don't hear about their

245
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,940
failures and there's a lot of failures

246
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,820
out there and that's where the true

247
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,180
learning is done and so if you decide to

248
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,890
stop when you hit a failure then you

249
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,430
might not activate this part but when

250
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,720
you when your emotions are regulated and

251
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,300
you decide to persevere and keep going

252
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,220
and learning you take that feedback and

253
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,010
it kind of activates the angular

254
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,930
cingulate cortex there's a lot I could

255
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,730
say here again there was so much

256
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,609
information but I tried to dice it down

257
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,400
into some really good nuggets for you so

258
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,290
the idea is to learn from a negative

259
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,770
experience

260
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,240
and this angular single cortex is

261
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,670
regulating emotions too that it doesn't

262
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,510
overwhelm you from that failure I failed

263
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,130
isn't overwhelming but you actually

264
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,460
learn from it and then kind of creates a

265
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,800
feedback loop and what's interesting is

266
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,870
the the ACC the engineer the singular

267
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,660
cortex comes up a lot so you'll see it

268
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,360
coming up more and so another thing

269
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,860
about entrepreneurship the traits I

270
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,330
guess that in the brain that happened

271
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,980
there's the exploratory and the

272
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,230
exploitative behaviors

273
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,900
so there's exploratory where you're

274
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,450
going out and trying to find new

275
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,939
experiences new stuff experimenting try

276
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,000
on air discovery search and novelty and

277
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,770
then there's the other portion where

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,540
it's exploitive you're taking that

279
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,880
information that you've gathered and now

280
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,980
exploiting it and producing and

281
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,930
optimizing and being efficient and again

282
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,700
you know I feel like I was reading a

283
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,400
hacker handbook when I was reading some

284
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,230
of these papers but the idea is shifting

285
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,079
between these two states is what is

286
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,110
really creating that entrepreneurial or

287
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,080
hacker spirit or at least one portion of

288
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,360
it so I found this quite interesting and

289
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,550
so when these parts of the brain are

290
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,060
activated this is how your brain looks

291
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:27,900
like in a functional MRI study where you

292
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,989
have exploitive and exploitative shift

293
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,790
so you're going back and forth so this

294
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,750
is these are the brain networks that we

295
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:42,300
talked about earlier that are being

296
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:48,090
activated so the next item is grit what

297
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,310
is great exactly well is grit this this

298
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,910
might be what you think about grit it

299
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:57,599
could be I did find this Tennessee grit

300
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,130
so I found that really interesting I did

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,760
actually Google Tennessee grew and I

302
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:07,230
found this so a homage to besides

303
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:10,500
Knoxville for this so but no grit is

304
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,600
this grit is a it's about perseverance

305
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,660
and passion okay

306
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,130
it is generally a positive trait but it

307
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,089
is possible to have too much grit and

308
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,999
then that could become

309
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,309
a negative trait as well and so that's

310
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:30,019
something to consider as well but in

311
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:34,980
general it is about perseverance passion

312
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:38,519
it's about finding something and and and

313
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:43,649
moving on so a really good someone who

314
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:45,720
talks at length about grit in all over

315
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:49,740
is Angela Duckworth and I definitely

316
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,279
recommend checking out her talks in her

317
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,720
book and she talks about a couple ways

318
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,529
to develop grin when I found interesting

319
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:02,279
were these two items as well where you

320
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:05,819
develop a fascination and then but you

321
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,680
also have a greater purpose so you know

322
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:11,069
a lot of us we have developed this

323
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,410
fascination for security and we do have

324
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:16,498
a somewhat you know grater but we feel

325
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,499
like we're doing something beneficial in

326
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:21,029
some ways or some fashion maybe not all

327
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,399
the times but you know there is

328
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,429
something to that in any case everybody

329
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,610
has their own purpose and there is also

330
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:31,350
the growth mindset I don't want to

331
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,699
forget about talk talking about that but

332
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,230
the growth mindset is also something

333
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,949
really important I have found that

334
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,089
personally to be very important when I

335
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:43,709
talk to other people and I recommend the

336
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:45,870
book by Carol Dweck on mindset the idea

337
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,609
with growth mindset if you don't know it

338
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,899
is that you have the fixed mindset and

339
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,179
the growth mindset and the fixed mindset

340
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:55,499
is like is is not accepting different

341
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:57,899
the ability to have different outcomes

342
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:01,829
or different scenarios growth mindset is

343
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,929
allowing for those different things to

344
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,479
happen there might be one way to to

345
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,970
solve a problem there there might be

346
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,199
another way like when you say oh I am

347
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,730
this so that you know they'll never

348
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,469
happen you're really putting yourself in

349
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,220
a fixed mindset and that's something to

350
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,499
to generally avoid so for example you

351
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,439
know staying on the mindset of rotating

352
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:24,059
your password every 90 days for example

353
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:26,849
that could be putting you in the fixed

354
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:29,850
mindset and so you know one question for

355
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,819
everyone in InfoSec really is you know

356
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,520
did you choose InfoSec after finding a

357
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,530
fascination there's a

358
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,930
a lot of people that may have listened

359
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,390
to darkness diaries for example or be

360
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,270
inspired by a show they saw one time ago

361
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,910
in there a kid or whatever maybe and and

362
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,900
kind of had this fascination I know

363
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,480
there is and then you know did you have

364
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,370
a greater purpose in emphasized as well

365
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,050
so these are you know some things to

366
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,300
consider and just ask yourself you know

367
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,099
is it is this something that you know I

368
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,740
can relate to as far as grip and then

369
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:10,790
you know dig deep into integral and so

370
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:13,280
grit in the brain again we have the

371
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,010
angular singular Quartus cortex as well

372
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,930
and so grit and growth mindset both

373
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,210
activate these regions of the brain and

374
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,630
so I found this pretty interesting as

375
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,840
well and so I wanted to share that with

376
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,780
you and here is a little bit of some

377
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,730
brain porn I just love looking at brains

378
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,350
and you can see the different areas of

379
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,350
the brain that are being activated and

380
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,709
now - my favorite part of this talk and

381
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:46,099
that's creativity creativity seems to be

382
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:49,430
a bottomless pit and I found it quite

383
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,710
interesting and so let's go into it so

384
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,079
what is creativity or what is it not

385
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,300
well creativity is not left brain or

386
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,130
right brain and it's not limited to the

387
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,050
fine arts and it's not just an

388
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,150
introverted or extroverted thing but

389
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,030
what creativity really is it's

390
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,550
everywhere it's in the science arts math

391
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,920
technical non-technical anywhere it's

392
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,200
part of the human condition it's a

393
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,660
little complicated and messy okay and

394
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,330
you know you can be both introverted and

395
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,780
extroverted if there's no one you know

396
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:23,240
there's no limitation here and so one

397
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,899
thing I did find was something called 10

398
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,790
habits of highly creative people and

399
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,460
this was a really interesting article

400
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,290
and looking at this I was blown away

401
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,630
this is almost everything what a hacker

402
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,190
is and so it might as well have been

403
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,010
called the ten Habits of Highly

404
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,270
Effective hackers where you have

405
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,350
imaginative play or you know you

406
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,450
daydream or maybe you're in solitude

407
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,350
right a lot of hackers like their

408
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,230
solitude

409
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,659
you know having a balance at least or

410
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:57,650
having some sort intuition like we're

411
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,720
syntax was able to figure out that you

412
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,549
know a networking problem for example

413
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,890
was not a networking problem but it was

414
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,350
actually an attack that was happening so

415
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,260
you know having that that theory of mine

416
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,730
then there's something called and the

417
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,020
components of theory of mine or you know

418
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,000
this intuition there is it's called

419
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,340
Xterra ception and proprioception in

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,299
interoception so appropriate section for

421
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,149
example is where it's more physical but

422
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,190
like in an interception it's being able

423
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,049
to understand someone else's beliefs for

424
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:33,400
example so having that like intuition

425
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:36,620
and so our openness to experience

426
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,299
experiences mindfulness maybe not you

427
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,439
know I think a lot of hackers might not

428
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,590
be too mindful I think we're getting

429
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,059
there but you know you know i think i

430
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,480
think we're improving on the mindfulness

431
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,840
factor so that's that's that's good

432
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,700
sensitivity Tania's Anka talks about how

433
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,959
she's sensitive and and can understand

434
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,030
it very empathetic and there's a live

435
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,820
been finding a lot of sensitive folks

436
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,580
out there so or being able to go through

437
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,309
logs and and and and see the different

438
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,449
nuances and being sensitive to that and

439
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,280
you know turning adversity to advantage

440
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,470
I mean give me a break that's like

441
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,610
everybody right and as well as thinking

442
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:17,960
differently so I found this quite quite

443
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:20,780
profound but what really makes a

444
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,530
creative person or a hacker right are we

445
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:28,190
born creative are we are and why are

446
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,049
kids more creative than adults so what I

447
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,120
found is being creative is about

448
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,580
unlearning traditional linear thinking

449
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,360
okay and again you could say that for a

450
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,980
hacker as well where it's more about

451
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
going multi path and not really like

452
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,330
step by step it's not necessarily a

453
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,000
equals B equal C or you know first a

454
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,549
then B then C but it could be a C F and

455
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,580
then back to B right so it's different

456
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,100
paths there's not one answer for

457
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,990
something there's multiple solutions for

458
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,090
something and so a lot of times we stand

459
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,549
in the way of creativity as a society

460
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,889
right there's been a lot of discussions

461
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,080
about like kids and kids naturally have

462
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,909
creativity for example and we actually

463
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,970
stifle their creativity so it's

464
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:19,100
something to take into consideration

465
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:22,929
we're also I found that a lot of hackers

466
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:27,049
had this this creativity this hacker

467
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:28,909
instinct in them but it was stifled at

468
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:30,408
some point one of the other you know

469
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,659
could be due to necessity or whatever

470
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,779
but then was reignited at some point

471
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:40,880
later in their life and so I'm finding a

472
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:43,909
lot of similarities between the two so

473
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,000
the next item is latent inhibition right

474
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:49,789
and so what do we think about when we

475
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,750
think about inhibition well for most of

476
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:56,390
us we think about this inhibition we're

477
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,870
you know we're trying to be super free

478
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,679
but no this is not inhibition this is

479
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,320
what Lane inhibition really is latent

480
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,010
inhibition is the reduced filtering of

481
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,840
noise okay so you might have heard of

482
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,500
hyperactivity or inattention or

483
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,928
distracted Nisour disorganization the

484
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,289
latent inhibition or ADHD or

485
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:26,690
disorganized creative imaginative

486
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:29,210
forgetful inhibition is the ability to

487
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,669
filter noise so latent inhibition is the

488
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,960
inability or the reduced ability to

489
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:38,059
filter noise and what's really

490
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,070
interesting is that ability has been

491
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,450
highly associated with creative

492
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,860
achievement and so there's also been

493
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,500
it's been shown to have irregular levels

494
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,689
of dopamine as well so you know if you

495
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,490
have ADHD or you think heavy or you're

496
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,559
you know people call you scattered or

497
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,740
you're disorganized or mind wandering

498
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,289
take these things as assets to yourself

499
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,890
to your creative to your hacker profile

500
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:06,908
right so these are things that we can

501
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,559
make them into strengths instead of

502
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:13,240
keeping them in the category that they

503
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,240
may have originally been put in

504
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,530
takes me to the next subject there's

505
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:22,060
been a really strong correlation between

506
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:24,389
creativity and mental illness in fact

507
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,700
there's a whole paper by dr. Carson

508
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,950
written on just this and if you look at

509
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,620
Vincent van Gogh for example Vincent I

510
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,900
go highly creative person cut off his

511
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,689
ear we don't know exactly why he cut off

512
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,640
his ear but that is something to take

513
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,180
into consideration so there has been

514
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,830
there have been correlations shown with

515
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,140
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia

516
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,830
spectrum disorder or otherwise called

517
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,830
SSD depression anxiety a variety of

518
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,899
things and so these same areas of the

519
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:00,100
brain that are activated for creativity

520
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,750
also end up being activated with mental

521
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,050
illness so it's kind of interesting and

522
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:08,560
in fact there's been like kind of like a

523
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:12,250
shared vulnerability model so for

524
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,990
example 80 percent of writers are were

525
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:19,450
said to have disabled from so it's sort

526
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:24,280
of mood disorder but but the thing is

527
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:28,090
here is that the shift in mental states

528
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:33,820
right that you use for creativity is

529
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:36,820
also soit is also associated with mental

530
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:41,110
illness so what's interesting is that

531
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,470
it's kind of like interdependent

532
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,240
together where you rely on some of these

533
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,560
vulnerability factors for your

534
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,330
creativity and then you're you know

535
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,060
creativity comes from the vulnerability

536
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,639
fact it's kind of a complex thing I'm

537
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,820
still trying to wrap my head around but

538
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,330
you know the idea is that they're very

539
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,129
very very strongly related so something

540
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,080
worth mentioning and you many of you out

541
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,300
there may know someone who's highly

542
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,159
creative but may have exhibited some of

543
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,159
these other factors as well

544
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,060
so one thing I do want to talk about is

545
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,990
the so another component of creativity

546
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:26,710
is divergent thinking this when I read

547
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,080
this I thought wow this is exactly what

548
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,900
we are we're non conformist we're

549
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,389
independent thinkers we have a lower

550
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,970
level of agreeableness and a higher

551
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,710
level of conscientiousness and what does

552
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,240
that mean well when I say lower level of

553
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,830
agreement is written was like we're

554
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,810
gonna tend to disagree or we're gonna

555
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,939
tend to question things I don't mean

556
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,730
being disagreeable although that could

557
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,760
happen as well as part of this but the

558
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,460
idea is to be is that this divergent

559
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,570
thinking is very prevalent among hackers

560
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,420
okay

561
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,330
and I this all this book is a wonderful

562
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,290
book talking about creativity again you

563
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:07,899
can use it on in your just life journey

564
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:10,060
as a hacker it's it's quite interesting

565
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,960
whether you're experienced or not the

566
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:16,270
book is really remarkable and so a lot

567
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,050
of folks have really discovered for

568
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,340
example Kia where you know she went

569
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,190
through she was an elementary school

570
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,320
teacher and they threw a icebreaker

571
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,890
exercise did something and she found

572
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,720
herself the only one in this one group

573
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:34,810
and so she realized that she was

574
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,210
divergent from everyone else and you

575
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:40,710
know although she loved the passion of

576
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:43,000
teaching and giving back she decided to

577
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,610
take advantage and do something else

578
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,570
with this divergent thinking and she's

579
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,370
now a really successful security

580
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,050
engineer and so you know that's

581
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,689
something to take into consideration and

582
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,669
here's a really good graphic that I saw

583
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,200
about divergent thinking and all the

584
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,320
different paths and how it's really

585
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,480
related to creativity so it's something

586
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,820
to consider it's something that's a part

587
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,460
of us right and it's something that's

588
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,980
good it drives other people crazy

589
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:17,820
sometimes but that's part of us right

590
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:20,190
that's our our our gift but

591
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,700
so do we just think differently and and

592
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,039
call it a day is you know do I just you

593
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,690
know buy an Apple MacBook and you know

594
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,429
save that I think therefore Lena I'm

595
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,759
done well not quite

596
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:37,109
there's two other components called

597
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:40,229
plasticity and convergence and what

598
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,970
happens here is o so let me so

599
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:44,340
plasticity is is the ability for your

600
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,580
brain to kind of like a change in and

601
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,580
and and and take advantage of new things

602
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,019
and convergence is is is actually so

603
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,928
well I'll walk you through so basically

604
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,519
what happens is you have divergence you

605
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,109
have this divergent thinking and it's

606
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,320
kind of like the idea ideation and

607
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:03,960
generation and then it goes through some

608
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,158
plasticity but then to actually get it

609
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,379
to like formation

610
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,599
you need to have convergence so in

611
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:11,428
actual convergence is kind of like the

612
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,830
executing I'm not kind of getting it

613
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,830
getting your idea to actually become

614
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:19,408
something so it's really interesting

615
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,949
that these three components are all part

616
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:25,889
of the the creative generation process

617
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,830
and here's like a kind of technical

618
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:31,918
breakdown where you have the generation

619
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,689
phase of the creative process right we

620
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,599
have past isset II and divergence and

621
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,309
then we have the selection phase of the

622
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,599
creative process where it's convergence

623
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,460
or it's actually coming out something so

624
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,509
the same thing as in a hacker for

625
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,859
example from a neuroscience perspective

626
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:48,690
these are this is a picture of neurons

627
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:51,029
here so actually divergence is a

628
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,700
one-to-many neuron kind of connection

629
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:56,700
and convergence is a many to one neuron

630
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,159
connection and this on the right I found

631
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:03,599
really interesting where you have

632
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:06,869
creativity as the the culmination of all

633
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,009
these three experiences and then if you

634
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:14,178
remember the networks we talked about

635
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:17,909
before you know creativity is activating

636
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:19,470
some of the the the three main networks

637
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,379
that are activated with creativity are

638
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,759
the default mode Network the sealings

639
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:28,049
Network and the central executive

640
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:30,989
network and it's it's it's like going

641
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,290
back and forth between these items and

642
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,820
then

643
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,309
you have the angular singular cortex

644
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,439
again activating here so you know

645
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:39,928
there's a lot going on here

646
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,760
but I did want to circle back with the

647
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,210
networks and kind of identify like which

648
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,850
networks are actually activated here and

649
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:50,549
here is a little bit of a little more

650
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,439
brain porn I just ended up loving

651
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:54,360
looking at these pictures and wanted to

652
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,460
share that with you this is a highly

653
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,290
creative network on the left here and a

654
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,419
quote-unquote low creative network on

655
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,399
the right again

656
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:05,010
neuroscience is ever-changing this could

657
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,809
be wrong in five years I don't know

658
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,720
but that's something I want to share

659
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,530
with you and this was a really cool

660
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,460
high-resolution image of all the

661
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:17,129
different areas of the brain so it's

662
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,840
it's really remarkable all the different

663
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,010
areas that are that are mapped in the

664
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:27,959
brain cool

665
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:32,580
so fostering creativity or in other

666
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,960
words fostering hackers waiting for it

667
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,178
to update it seems like there's a lag in

668
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,630
the update so or in other words

669
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:43,169
fostering hackers so how do we how do we

670
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,400
do this how do we do this well some of

671
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:46,530
the things we can do are learn

672
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,910
unfamiliar subjects well that's what

673
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,470
that's what security is about right

674
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,270
we're always having to learn something

675
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,179
new we're always having to keep you to

676
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:58,500
keep up on things try new things well

677
00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:01,410
yeah like CTFs and and and just building

678
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,330
and and keep going divergent thinking I

679
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,370
think they're you know that's that's

680
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,799
pretty self-explanatory that's part of

681
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,120
us watching someone else creating

682
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,520
literally that's this was a

683
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,439
recommendation on how to be more

684
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,918
creative is watching out someone be

685
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,809
creative

686
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,120
well the same thing with hackers right

687
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:20,190
we can how many how many YouTube videos

688
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,110
are there of people just hacking and we

689
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,549
could just like you know just activating

690
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,678
things in a ring whether we know it or

691
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:29,280
not and even watching sci-fi and fantasy

692
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,559
films as well so you know it's it's a

693
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:37,309
part of our of our nature it's it's it's

694
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:39,080
gonna make us more creative and so we're

695
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,730
creativity found well you know

696
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,408
traditionally he was always found you

697
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,179
know in the fine arts domain but like I

698
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:46,789
said before it can be found anywhere

699
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:50,029
take for example the science and math

700
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:54,620
domain right and this is a really good

701
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:56,779
example of John Nash where he was

702
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:00,049
diagnosed or you know has schizophrenia

703
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:01,999
disorder and it was a remarkable

704
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:05,600
mathematician that won a Nobel Prize and

705
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:07,309
someone asked him you know why why did

706
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,178
you believe that aliens came from outer

707
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,340
space if you haven't seen this movie

708
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,080
definitely recommend watching it he goes

709
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,889
because ideas I had about supernatural

710
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,049
beings came to me the same way that my

711
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:20,029
mathematical ideas did so I took them

712
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:22,970
seriously and it was quite remarkable

713
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:27,409
that statement and so there's something

714
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:30,590
to be said about mental illness and and

715
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:33,049
creativity and and and an acceptance of

716
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:36,289
all these things but again like I said

717
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,369
creativity can be found anywhere so you

718
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,649
know whether you're a teacher whether

719
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,070
you're mechanic if you're a human

720
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:46,399
creativity is with you it's up to you to

721
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:49,340
nurture it and bring it out but back to

722
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,820
the science and math what if you're both

723
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,509
right what if you're both like a super

724
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,580
mathematician like tiny for example is

725
00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:00,470
highly concentrated in mathematics but

726
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,279
she's all she also has an album on

727
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:06,980
Spotify or Lauren gray where he's a pen

728
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,299
tester but also a nerdcore rapper as

729
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,399
well or maybe Robin Stewart where she's

730
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,429
a threat and malware researcher but

731
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,008
she's also a novelist as well and many

732
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:23,389
many many more there are so many

733
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:26,210
examples I see out there of people being

734
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:28,699
creative in all different domains and

735
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:37,960
and and it's a really remarkable part of

736
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:41,269
the human condition I think I hear some

737
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,419
so putting it all together what are we

738
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:46,820
gonna do with all this information ooh

739
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,690
sorry so putting it all together what

740
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,289
are we going to do with all this

741
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,140
information

742
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:54,350
you're probably like this right now

743
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,299
and I probably threw a lot of things at

744
00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:02,178
you and so you probably feel like this

745
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:04,850
as well and what I would say is let's

746
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:09,920
have some coffee and take them a second

747
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:12,020
to step back and just listen and and and

748
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,420
let all the soak in and what I'm gonna

749
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,470
do is put it all together for you so

750
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:21,860
what we have is the IOC s sorry if

751
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:29,030
someone if someone is unmuted or we can

752
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:31,580
go on you so what we have here are the

753
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:36,080
IOC s of entrepreneurship grit and

754
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:39,770
creativity we have this information and

755
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,168
all this leads to becoming more creative

756
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:45,799
or in other words a hacker they're all

757
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:48,230
connected all this is connected and we

758
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,840
need to unlearn some things you know and

759
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,570
we need to continually unlearn things ok

760
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,159
because that's part of being a hacker is

761
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,830
things are gonna change

762
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,620
so what may have been true before may

763
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,470
not be true anymore and we know this but

764
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,199
you know nobody like it's it hasn't been

765
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,910
put into words right and exercise often

766
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,889
so all these different parts of your

767
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,668
brain exercise them exercise them often

768
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:16,790
and that will keep you getting becoming

769
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:18,049
a better hacker but with all this

770
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,050
information what can we do with this

771
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,659
well if you're new then look for these

772
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,149
traits in yourself ok and if you've been

773
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,460
around for a while then discover more

774
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,409
about yourself just keep learning you

775
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,320
know like I said I learned recently that

776
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,659
I was a nerd I found some article by

777
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,629
Rand actually it was an amazing article

778
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,639
and it was the articles written for

779
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:43,969
someone else to learn about nerds but I

780
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,619
actually learned more by myself and you

781
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,899
know if you're affiliated with the

782
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,240
hacker community then use this

783
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:52,879
information to understand this person

784
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,918
that's in your life so you might find

785
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,659
that really profound and really

786
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,000
interesting in understanding and

787
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:03,080
creating good understanding and here is

788
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,810
a yarol for an IOC for entrepreneurship

789
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,830
and

790
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:13,170
other rules for grit and creativity as

791
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:16,950
well so I do want to note that the field

792
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,280
of neuroscience is vast and deep these

793
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,189
are all the different parts of

794
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,660
neuroscience and our different fields

795
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,540
that are available in neuroscience so

796
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,640
it's quite amazing I think some of this

797
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,850
touched upon like cognitive neuroscience

798
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:37,350
and neuro psychology as well so I just

799
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:38,279
want to give you that note and with all

800
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,230
this information

801
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,640
you know I saw so much overlap I decided

802
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,700
to do something interesting

803
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,540
I created the creativity kill chain and

804
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,100
so this is a kill chain that basically

805
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,020
shows everything I just presented right

806
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,390
now but in a kill chain format and so

807
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,190
it's something to keep aware of if

808
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:00,420
you're looking or anything to kill any

809
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,420
minoo if you're if you look at anything

810
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,200
to impede your your creativity and then

811
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,500
I decided to take it a step further and

812
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,270
I think because it's a there's you know

813
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,730
there's been some controversy about like

814
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:18,740
having one kill chain so I created the

815
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:21,330
unified hacker brain kill chain and so

816
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,640
this is where you have creativity

817
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,140
entrepreneurship and grit all combined

818
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,580
together and all the different

819
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,250
components that we talked about

820
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,210
divergent thinking exploratory and

821
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:34,410
exploitative the angular singular cortex

822
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:38,870
perseverance all these items coming

823
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:42,839
together to form you the hacker and so

I'd be happy I'm gonna keep going every

830
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,070
day I keep finding new papers and

831
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,970
reading them and they're just so

832
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:02,760
fascinating so you know the rabbit hole

833
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,950
is pretty deep I created a link if you

834
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,550
want where I'm going to list some of the

835
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:12,120
resources that I mentioned on here as

836
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,850
well and that's about it and so I really

837
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,180
want to thank the organizers of b-sides

838
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,180

this has been exciting thank you and I'd

841
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:39,029
like to open it up for questions if

842
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:47,129
there's any questions yeah yeah there

843
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:55,109
there's conversation going on and yeah

844
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:58,229
can you hear me I can hear you yes so I

845
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:02,609
hop into this board yeah yeah yeah

846
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:04,140
definitely I mean my first ask is you

847
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:06,419
know maybe one of the attendees will do

848
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,538
it but I need a reading list I need a

849
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:10,828
book list yeah from this talk and I'm

850
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:16,199
probably gonna watch this talk to few

851
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:20,099
more times yeah it was a lot you know it

852
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,419
was a lot to take in and and it's I'm

853
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,559
still you know there's still so much

854
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:24,888
there's a lot of stuff I left out

855
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:29,719
there's like 10 slides I had to hide

856
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:34,199
because it was just getting too much so

857
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:35,519
yeah yeah did I I really appreciate this

858
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,829
talk that this was something I always

859
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,328
wanted to do because I started noticing

860
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:44,279
stuff like this a while ago like in 2015

861
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:47,189
I gave a talk at besides Las Vegas

862
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:49,229
called widest InfoSec play bass because

863
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:51,299
I'm a bass player and I just like

864
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:54,328
pattern but I kept running into other

865
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:55,649
folks in InfoSec that played bass well

866
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:57,809
I'm like what am I not running into

867
00:38:55,649 --> 00:39:00,868
guitarists or drummers like like white

868
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:03,089
why that instrument you know so I did

869
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:05,149
some surveys and stuff like that and and

870
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:07,649
presented what I found but it didn't go

871
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:10,169
nearly deep enough to satisfy my

872
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:12,598
curiosity and and I I think your talk

873
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:16,169
finally did it for me like I think you

874
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,779
finally went deep enough for me to you

875
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:20,669
know really scratch that edge so I'm

876
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:23,159
gonna watch it a few more times nice

877
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:25,408
nice yeah yeah you know I just I have

878
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,359
this like habit of just going deep I

879
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:29,699
mean even with coffee I want to know

880
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,369
like the exact chemical process of of

881
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:35,690
the water and the interchange

882
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,890
so yeah yeah I was glad you know I think

883
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,430
we're really lucky that all a lot of

884
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,740
this information is available online you

885
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:46,640
know but definitely looking to take this

886
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:50,328
research further so you know at the at

887
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,009
least in a post kovat era yeah so

888
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,349
speaking of that we do have a few

889
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:56,809
questions and one of them asks about you

890
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:58,670
know is Co vid an opportunity or is it

891
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:02,029
can have an impact you know as we kind

892
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:04,400
of shut down societies and businesses or

893
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:05,960
having to adapt like is this is that an

894
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,869
opportunity is that going to result in

895
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:14,240
any major changes along these sorts of

896
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:16,220
lines I think it's gonna you know I

897
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,479
think it's gonna allow people to do a

898
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,180
little more introspection about

899
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:26,240
themselves so you know what I'm noticing

900
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:28,970
is like people are either stuck you know

901
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,459
or like kind of like you know taking

902
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,319
this as like a failure and and getting

903
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,859
stuck or they're either getting past it

904
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:37,999
and making the best out of it and so

905
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,950
it's kind of like you know when you're

906
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,618
in the CTF right you sit there and you

907
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,450
know get you know just

908
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:46,249
you know do nothing or do you stand up

909
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,700
walk away and try to think differently

910
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:52,549
so I think from in a covert era you know

911
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,720
it won't change how we think but you

912
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:55,759
know I think we have more time to

913
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,399
reflect on our on our on our personality

914
00:40:55,759 --> 00:41:02,299
traits I don't know if that answers the

915
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,369
emotion or not yeah I think so

916
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:07,069
another question did you look take a

917
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:09,769
look at any personality profiles common

918
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:11,239
ones like MBTI during your research to

919
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:14,180
see if that had any correlation with

920
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,460
hacker types or like di SC profiles and

921
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,649
other personality systems I thought

922
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,650
about that but I didn't want to

923
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,450
complicate the topic so I wanted to

924
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,849
stick to pure neuroscience but it does

925
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,529
definitely in mind as well taking a look

926
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,509
at the correlation of some of these

927
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:32,119
personality profiles to some of the

928
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:33,589
stuff I mentioned here yeah myers-briggs

929
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,819
stuff like that as a real rabbit hole

930
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:40,009
yeah yeah seriously yeah you think that

931
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:43,160
would be an interesting one to hear more

932
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:45,150
on because I know you know a lot of HR a

933
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,190
lot of hiring actively used

934
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,950
some of those you know so that that

935
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,180
directly impacts a lot of us yeah and

936
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,279
you know what I you know in the whole

937
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,200
field in general I think that's

938
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:57,779
something that we sometimes get stuck in

939
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,939
where we think hey I am this and that's

940
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:02,339
and that's you know it's good to

941
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,309
understand that about yourself but you

942
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:07,740
have to allow room for for differences

943
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:09,240
right because psychology I mean listen

944
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,490
you know in the 60s they used to do

945
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,288
electric shock and think that that was

946
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,538
like you know healthy and that was you

947
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:16,829
know solving things so this field is

948
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:18,900
always changing you know these three

949
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:20,760
pounds in here we still haven't figured

950
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,859
anything you know close to everything

951
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,799
about it so you know a you know when HR

952
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:34,200
when HR v6 tier colita like that

953
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:36,390
question when when when you know

954
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,759
especially HR is a good example like if

955
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,589
they do a personality test and like put

956
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,869
people in these different buckets that's

957
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:45,480
not what we are right you have to be

958
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:47,130
able to see past some of these things

959
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,200
uses the indicator use it as as

960
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:53,359
something but don't let any a bias

961
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,359
effect that that's my two cents on that

962
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:01,680
feel free to answer the coffee questions

963
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:03,030
if you want yeah so v60 I've been you

964
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,210
know the colita I haven't been able to

965
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:09,060
get it right here yeah the kalenna

966
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,460
haven't been able to get good good out

967
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,740
of it but it's supposed to be better for

968
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:20,240
when your grinds not good but yeah v60

969
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:20,240
for me that's my go through daily nice

970
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:27,390
alright yes so I think that's about it

971
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,300
for the questions you know feel free to

972
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:33,150
jump into the the discord and chat with

973
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:39,329
folks there's some good conversation

974
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:43,109
going on there yeah big thanks to Farina

975
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:45,030
also last year's keynote speaker so we

976
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:48,060
have a tradition here I probably

977
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,160
everyone doesn't know but the the

978
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,790
previous year's keynote speaker picks

979
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,339
next year's keynote speaker so very

980
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,680
rarely have we had anybody just say yeah

981
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:00,720
here's your keynote speaker typically

982
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,540
what happens is they say here's three

983
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,060
options or I think Farina gave me like

984
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,490
five or six or something like that so I

985
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,200
still have to make a hard decision which

986
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,939
is half of the reason that I do this is

987
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,240
it's a really tough decision and I'm

988
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,390
being selfish and offloading it but also

989
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,209
I figure in what I was hoping would come

990
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,549
out of it and it has is we get keynote

991
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,800
speakers coming from completely

992
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,800
different place direction then I would

993
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,920
pick or any of the organizers would pick

994
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,020
we've had you know I think only one of

995
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,829
our keynote speakers in the six years

996
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:41,190
now are people that I were aware of or

997
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:43,079
actively aware of before they came to us

998
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,670
so it's very cool for me it's you know

999
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,160
opening up my network of people that I

1000
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,960
know and I'm seeing talks that would

1001
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,390
have never seen otherwise and learning

1002
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,500
stuff I never would have otherwise so

1003
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:58,290
you've got some time and eventually I'm

1004
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,819
gonna come to you and say okay 2021 what

1005
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,700
what are my options here who do you

1006
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:04,710
think we should have do the keynote

1007
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,000
that's awesome that's awesome yeah I

1008
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,280
really appreciate the opportunity I

1009
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,940
think

1010
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,270
this has been a hard talk to get you

1011
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,150
know submitted and accepted because you

1012
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:20,960
know a lot of times it's hard to like

1013
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:23,150
kind of quantify so I I took a chance to

1014
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,130
talk about something that you know I

1015
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,540
didn't haven't I've been you know

1016
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,450
studying it for a while but like yeah

1017
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:32,779
definitely appreciate the opportunity

1018
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,879

worthy keynote and didn't really know

1027
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,520
what the topic was going to be into like

1028

times and if you don't have time to

1032
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,310
worry about it somebody here will create

1033
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:18,470
a book list out of the out of the slides

1034

that you presented and we'll we'll get

1035
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:26,319
like an audible or an Amazon list shared

1036
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:29,840
somewhere cool cool cool what I posted I

1037
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,580
posted the slides on that link that I

1038
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,810
had there and then I guess if this would

1039
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,200
be on YouTube we could update the

1040

description with the details so I just

1041
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,049
