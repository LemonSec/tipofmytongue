1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:08,620
all right thanks everyone thanks for

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:08,620
showing up uh let's get started here

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm Tony Ruchi and here's a little bit

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,750
of background on me

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
maybe all heard me talk before

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,198
I'm a retired counterintelligence

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,119
special agent and I kind of grew up in

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,090
the intelligence community running

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,650
computer crimes investigations for a

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,210
good part of my career and retired in

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:38,030
2004 went out to work at Oak Ridge

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:40,940
National Lab and 2011 we recruited to go

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,730
out to Reno Nevada to go build some data

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,860
centers out there and after we stood

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,150
them up I stepped away and began

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,430
starting some companies in the

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:58,070
commercial space out there well I found

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:01:01,460
very quickly that a lot of folks are you

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,260
know focused on keep the lights on and

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,280
the day-to-day operations and one of the

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,630
things that they used to ask me about

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,410
all the time is hey can you come out and

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,330
and give us a look you know kind of a

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,490
walk down our stack and give us a

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,560
security look another set of eyes and so

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,460
that really stood up a couple of sectors

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,770
of business for me and and you know as a

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,570
result I kind of transitioned a lot of

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,970
that military training in the government

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,970
space into commercial sector and

31
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,120
especially these days with ransomware

32
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,690
and data breach is kind of running off

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,670
the charts it's one of those things that

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,649
I mean it's not going away while a lot

35
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,750
of people have been out of work there's

36
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,580
many of us in the InfoSec community and

37
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,240
especially the incident responders side

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:50,450
of it would have been you know busier

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,419
than ever so let's get right into it and

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,670
take a look kind of what you know

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,620
everybody has their their media sources

42
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,330
and the news that you look at these days

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,710
and you know people think about when

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,210
they have the security education

45
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,949
awareness they start talking about their

46
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,919
email really focusing on your email and

47
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,260
watch the links and your email your

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,819
bedded email but you know one of the

49
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,319
things that's transitioning has been

50
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,730
transitioning for a while is you know

51
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,260
where do you read your news you're

52
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,260
either reading it online or your

53
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:25,129
portable or your mobile devices and that

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,548
type of thing but in a lot of cases we

55
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:31,518
were reading it online and watching you

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:34,129
know web-based news and you know how

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,450
easy is that to manipulate that traffic

58
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:37,608
especially if somebody's in close

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,379
proximity to you do like a minute man in

60
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:41,269
the middle attack and be able to

61
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,560
manipulate that traffic and put

62
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,760
something there in the headlines that's

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,230
attractive to you and I know you're

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,250
gonna click on it if it's if it's

65
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,500
something that's relevant to you so

66
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,180
everybody has their own media of choice

67
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,790
for social media some people like to

68
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,760
watch videos you're watching you know

69
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,230
your news through very specific apps if

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,090
you've got children in school you might

71
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,168
have an app that's provided by the

72
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,189
school and the staff a lot of cases

73
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,079
everybody's ordering from online

74
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,668
services these days so you know you're

75
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,099
waiting for that next package coming in

76
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:19,159
for Amazon it's pretty simplistic to

77
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:22,159
create that link and put it in your put

78
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,388
it in a message to you and there's a

79
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,909
good chance you're going to click that

80
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:28,819
and if you that mobile device happens to

81
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:30,530
be connected to your domain then then

82
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,810
it's game over in a lot of cases it's

83
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,549
just like clicking that email link

84
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:40,970
within those environments so just a an

85
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:42,799
age we equate ransomware to the corona

86
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,449
virus in your network you have to ask

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,060
yourself a few questions is your network

88
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,590
really ready for a ransomware attack I

89
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,449
guess the real question is can you

90
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,560
recover your network from a ransomware

91
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,629
attacks especially if you're the

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,919
defender yourself you know one of the

93
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:02,509
challenges being able to defend that and

94
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,129
recover it we always ask one of the

95
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,349
first questions that I always ask well

96
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,659
first two questions when I get called

97
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:12,319
out on an incident is you know do you

98
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:14,179
have in bet in onboard IT staff or they

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,530
outsource and what your recovery

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,630
strategy look like do you have a

101
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,889
recovery plan and your are you able to

102
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,080
recover you know you know a lot of cases

103
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:25,729
they don't really know if they can

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,590
recover because they've never exercised

105
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,900
it so we ask them have you ever actually

106
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,580
your cyber incident response plan then

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,760
that's when you get the sucking teeth in

108
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,590
a lot of cases you know it's either the

109
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,270
answer is going to be no or yeah we're

110
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,750
kind of building in that direction but

111
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,700
yeah we really haven't haven't gotten

112
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,680
there yet yeah we're working on that

113
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,469
well it's too late when you're you're

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,940
still working on that and the reality is

115
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,250
in a lot of cases they don't even know

116
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,050
what the hell it is and then that's the

117
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,270
day that you know that you're probably

118
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,950
going to be negotiating with somebody if

119
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,440
down the road if they have been

120
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,830
compromised with ransomware so that's

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,050
one of those types of you know moments

122
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:14,930
and it's the aha moment you know early

123
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,700
on now one of these to consider is the

124
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,290
type of ransomware that's compromised

125
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,169
the network as well because there's a

126
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,090
few families of ransomware that I've

127
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,020
dealt with and just since Thanksgiving

128
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,960
I've dealt with about six or seven cases

129
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,430
specifically and on three occasions

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,310
phobos ransomware which comes under the

131
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:39,229
Dharma family is one of those unique

132
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,130
varieties of ransomware where it has a

133
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:45,770
nasty habit a favorable habit for us of

134
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,370
failing midstream and so it doesn't do

135
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,500
full encryption it doesn't continuous

136
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,960
the overwrite the data that it's deleted

137
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,870
so as it encrypts the the top layer of

138
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,000
the files you can in a lot of cases go

139
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,570
in and do like a forensics recovery if

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,520
you've overwritten data or view deleted

141
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,349
data in the past and trying to recover

142
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,349
that data from the from the raw drive

143
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,150
and and I'll talk about that a bit and

144
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,789
I'm gonna kind of mix two different

145
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,109
cases I know I know in the bio there I

146
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,940
said that I was going to talk about a

147
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,860
specific case but I'm going to talk

148
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,330
about two of them one was with regards

149
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,940
to to Phobos and and then another one

150
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,010
here that is pretty unique in and of

151
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,530
itself here that we'll talk about

152
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,960
but that's something I always consider

153
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,869
and we'll talk about recovery in just a

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,039
little bit but for those attackers out

155
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,400
there you know some are much more

156
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,099
disciplined and they have their attack

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,539
Keim's and then you know they do this as

158
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,580
a business you know ransomware as a

159
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,860
service is out there

160
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,659
well ransomware as a service heads-up

161
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,060
dashboards and command control centers

162
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,700
they can be purchased for you know four

163
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,980
hundred dollars anybody can go out there

164
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,409
in the dark net and you know purchase

165
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,520
Philadelphia and if you're familiar with

166
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:10,250
any kind of sales management or CMS

167
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,099
dashboards is very Salesforce like you

168
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,080
know you can track who you've who your

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,910
victims are you can build your attack

170
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,039
platforms you can attack specific type

171
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,260
of systems you can keep track of them

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,010
globally where they are and it gives you

173
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,270
a lot of heads-up information in there

174
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,070
one of the things with regards to

175
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,359
Philadelphia and a few others I think

176
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,360
it's pretty interesting that there's the

177
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,270
the give mercy button there if you look

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,970
at it down the bottom about about seven

179
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,729
o'clock so somebody gives you a good

180
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,520
enough story to the attacker they're

181
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,470
gonna be able to you know just go ahead

182
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,930
and hit that button and give you your

183
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:54,770
decryption keys back or send you to a

184
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,770
link where you can download those keys

185
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:03,640
so that's it's kind of feature-rich

186
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:08,479
right if you might say Joe Cruz another

187
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,870
c2 here that is been in the news and

188
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,880
it's been used quite a bit lately

189
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,290
and it just has a few more features than

190
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,090
Philadelphia but it's just a

191
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,830
straightforward navigation you can just

192
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,510
walk right down it's very intuitive you

193
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,120
don't have a have have to have a lot of

194
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,650
skill or training in it that's the scary

195
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,140
thing is because a lot of these folks

196
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,600
who are hidden companies especially on

197
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,189
the small to medium scale they don't

198
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,590
have a lot of training and so if they

199
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,630
screw something up in your network or if

200
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,730
you piss them off or they get pissed off

201
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,700
themselves just out of out of pure

202
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,320
anxiety they walk away and you're not

203
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,050
getting your data back if you've got no

204
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,670
way to recover yourself and so it's

205
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:54,229
extremely important to manage the

206
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,770
conversation and we'll talk about that

207
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,560
and

208
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:02,689
pretty good detail just a second there's

209
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,310
a few more shots of Joker ooh kind of

210
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,230
look at there's the victims list there

211
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,719
it gives you a nice heads-up display of

212
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,580
your victims themselves and then hey

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,920
there's my reporting page so I can see

214
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,270
who has what and how I want to report

215
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,449
that activity out maybe I've got a

216
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,449
report to my seniors because I'm I'm

217
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,890
just a field agent out there and I need

218
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:28,279
to keep on task right I'm tier I'm tier

219
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,689
one and then here's your attack builder

220
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,790
if you want to go ahead and build a

221
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,529
campaign it's just like if you you know

222
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,560
if you have like the know before or fish

223
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,760
me or whatever those other you know

224
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,560
campaign builders are it's the same type

225
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,319
of thing you build your campaigns of

226
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,790
attack against your your targets so you

227
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,410
have to think about you know kind of

228
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,620
your your victim management and do's and

229
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,510
dont's they're you know when I get

230
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,540
called out for an instant response and

231
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,930
somebody calls up and it's usually the

232
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,730
first conversation is is extreme they're

233
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,770
in stream peril and this is the worst

234
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,170
day in a company's life in a lot of

235
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,490
cases because they've invested you know

236
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,189
so much and they're keeping their

237
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,440
business you know operating or making it

238
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,940
successful and and then now all of a

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,770
sudden they just watched everything go

240
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,140
sideways overnight they come in after a

241
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,180
long weekend a long holiday and that's

242
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,240
usually when those calls come in over

243
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,010
Thanksgiving Christmas New Year's fourth

244
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,310
of July or whatever that long holiday

245
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,430
might be that's when these things seem

246
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,760
to happen but you know remember that

247
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,829
whenever you're negotiating with an

248
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,420
attacker or any of the conversations

249
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:42,529
you're acting on the behalf of your

250
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,390
clients so you can't have a

251
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:50,120
holier-than-thou type of attitude and

252
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,250
you need to to make sure that you know

253
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,209
if the client doesn't already have a

254
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,790
Bitcoin account you may already have one

255
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,010
if you're an intersect professional and

256
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,189
you may already have one day you may you

257
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,950
know be willing to offer up you know the

258
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,390
the account to to do the transaction but

259
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,340
in some cases it's a

260
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,689
liability and they don't want that they

261
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,020
want they we've got to keep it

262
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,220
maintaining within our our own sector so

263
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,380
we've got to build the count themselves

264
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,900
so that's something very important we'll

265
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,490
talk about the account itself because

266
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,140
you don't you stand up a Bitcoin account

267
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,420
overnight and you don't just stand up at

268
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,400
a count tonight and then throw money in

269
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,319
it this afternoon and then expect to

270
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,180
transact you know fifty thousand dollars

271
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,360
tomorrow it doesn't work that way in

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,089
most cases and in some cases you're

273
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,360
going to get these ransom notes says you

274
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:47,090
have 48 hours to respond and act and

275
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,590
move money and you know that's that's an

276
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,600
indicator for you whether or not you're

277
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,220
dealing with the mature organization or

278
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,680
you know some script kiddie out there

279
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,640
who may have just downloaded and and

280
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,390
spent you know his allowance on a four

281
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,260
hundred all a piece of software lets you

282
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,319
kind of look through that we're gonna

283
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,550
walk through each one of these here but

284
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,260
it's important that you pay attention to

285
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,180
these and I'm going to have this whole

286
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,360
slide deck available to you at the end

287
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:21,520
as well I'll drop it in my my instance

288
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,590
there but no matter what goes what

289
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,990
happens with with the engagement one of

290
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:29,750
the questions it's always asked from the

291
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,670
client is you know alright so if I pay

292
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,930
this we're definitely getting our keys

293
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:40,040
back right and the answer is you know

294
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,479
maybe maybe not these days in most of

295
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,370
the cases that I worked it's it's high

296
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,550
probability that it's upwards of you

297
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,100
know mid 90s percent that you're getting

298
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,760
the credentials back or the decryption

299
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,830
keys back in whatever form that is this

300
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,990
day it's almost like they have a Yelp

301
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,640
you know in the underworld where they

302
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,820
they've got to keep up their Yelp rating

303
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,069
because you know when you do your

304
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,610
research and you find out who it is

305
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,810
who may be attacking you you kind of

306
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,610
know whether or not you're going to get

307
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,920
them back by the time you you pull that

308
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,220
trigger but we'll talk about that as we

309
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,189
kind of roll along here so getting back

310
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,780
to the Bitcoin account set up you know

311
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,639
is a few folks who've already s you know

312
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,429
you know setting up

313
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,799
Bitcoin account you know am i setting up

314
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:30,679
an individual account or my city setting

315
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,399
up a business account does it make a

316
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,470
difference

317
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,769
it does because the way you set it up

318
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,319
allows you to move money quicker and you

319
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:42,290
have forms of identity that you can

320
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:47,139
provide that you can validate yourself

321
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:50,209
you know the pure essence of you know

322
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:52,279
cryptocurrency is the anonymity in a lot

323
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,920
of cases but in these tape types of

324
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,679
incidents you're not going to have all

325
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,118
that at that level of anonymity if you

326
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,279
need to set it up quickly because you

327
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:03,230
need to perform provide you know some

328
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,420
form of federal ID or something like

329
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,160
that a lot of cases depending on you

330
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,618
know which service you decide to set up

331
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,209
an account and so those are things

332
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:14,989
they're all taking consideration and

333
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:17,809
I've got a little bit coin 101 that I'm

334
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:20,269
going to add to the deck there at the

335
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:22,429
end of it along with these right here as

336
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,619
well but yeah you pick your your

337
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,689
exchange of choice you know coin base is

338
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:30,049
an example there put them things that

339
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:32,179
you can do you can put credit card you

340
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,610
know attach that to the account and you

341
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:37,369
can move money almost immediately but

342
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,679
you can only move a little bit of money

343
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:43,279
at a time and you have to kind of build

344
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,379
the trust with them and you have to you

345
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,529
can level up if you will I'll show that

346
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:50,899
next slide but it's important to point

347
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,339
out but if you do bank transfers yeah I

348
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,350
can move a whole lot of money with the

349
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,179
bank transfer fifty thousand dollars I

350
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,549
can move that tonight but that money is

351
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:00,649
going to sit there just like if I moved

352
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,779
fifty thousand dollars into a bank

353
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,970
account I really can't touch it for you

354
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:08,749
know five six seven eight nine days

355
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,339
depending on where that is and wouldn't

356
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:12,079
you know it as soon as you start a talk

357
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,939
like this that's when the phone rings I

358
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,388
think the phone of the dogs in most

359
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:20,299
cases but so those are things that you

360
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:23,360
need to take time and research and and

361
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:25,579
and help educate them as well because

362
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,919
the levelling up is extremely important

363
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,589
a lot of cases you're dealing with you

364
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,439
know maybe they have been hit with a you

365
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,329
know a - Bitcoin ransom or something

366
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:36,380
like that and you can negotiate those

367
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,839
things down

368
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,720
but you know in some cases you know

369
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,550
you're dealing with you know you know a

370
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,980
million dollars and that that might be

371
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,890
extremely challenging in a lot of cases

372
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,780
so those are things that to take it in

373
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,900
consideration and so you can see by the

374
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:57,170
time you level up into level 3 which

375
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,270
which may take a bit of time so you know

376
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,500
you can encourage them to use your

377
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,420
account or use a another organization's

378
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,170
account that already has one or if

379
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,579
you've got a pre relationship with them

380
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,469
already and that's something that

381
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,060
they're concerned about have that

382
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,530
conversation now say hey you might want

383
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,479
to go ahead and set up an account and

384
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,640
just move some money back and forth and

385
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,120
then begin stablishing the bona fides

386
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,610
with with that exchange that way if the

387
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,280
time does come because you know it's

388
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,020
quite quite possible that their time is

389
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,790
going to come and then it all boils down

390
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,920
to how fast they can move it to be able

391
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,920
to respond and keep those numbers down I

392
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,000
guess the big takeaway there is is at

393
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,820
the end we already reinforced that a few

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,010
times so here's an example of the faux

395
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,460
beau splash screen and it's on the info

396
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,680
text file that's just dropped usually in

397
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,450
the C driver or somewhere in the route

398
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,400
and it's dropped in a bunch of different

399
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,240
places on a machine once it's been

400
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,350
compromised

401
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,620
but you know kind of walking through

402
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,780
that tells you a lot because most cases

403
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,099
you're gonna see this just as a copy and

404
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,720
paste template and they'll just change

405
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,240
the header information their primary

406
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,670
secondary email and the reference ID

407
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,370
it's it's their reference ID and you

408
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,390
descend it's a it's a dash and then then

409
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:24,649
you're usually a four to six digit

410
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,900
reference ID and that's you as the

411
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,210
victim and that's that's what you put in

412
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,150
all the headers back to the emails back

413
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,880
to them so it gives you a little bit

414
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,270
instruction there and here's some your

415
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,160
proof of life opportunity here they're

416
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,230
already telling you hey we want to show

417
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,030
you that we can decrypt your data you

418
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,130
it's important to make sure that you

419
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,260
leverage that and take advantage of that

420
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,940
if a time comes when you had that

421
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,350
conversation with them that

422
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,000
you want to go ahead and send them a

423
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,480
couple of mundane files that have been

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,080
encrypted first to prove them prove to

425
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,060
you that they can compromise are that

426
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,300
they can decrypt those files and return

427
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,950
those to you and then this is an

428
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,750
important statement here about how to

429
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,940
obtain the bitcoins this is where you

430
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,200
can really determine the maturity in a

431
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,850
lot of cases of the organization and you

432
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,870
can tell whether or not they're seasoned

433
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,610
they know what they're doing

434
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,229
the verbage in here is very

435
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,719
straightforward and standard they won't

436
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,520
try to rush you they won't try to throw

437
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,590
any idle threats in here but this is one

438
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,300
of those ones that they those those

439
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,129
blocks right here where they'll throw in

440
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,750
there that you've only got 48 hours to

441
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,330
stand up a Bitcoin account and money

442
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,580
needs to be there or you know we're

443
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,949
gonna start doubling it every every 24

444
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,929
hours after that you know no delays and

445
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,940
I'll try to throw all the the anxiety

446
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,740
and stress on you that's what really

447
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,770
flips people out but that's also an

448
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,610
indicator that somebody's really doesn't

449
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,160
know what they're doing because they

450
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:57,879
don't realize and take time to sit back

451
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,930
and think the other indicator is

452
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,790
secondary communications while you've

453
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,770
got a couple of email accounts up there

454
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,879
that you can use and leverage you also

455
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:09,940
have a jabber client in here and I'll

456
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,750
show you the jet or the another

457
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,150
communications client and the other

458
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,400
splash screen here in a second but that

459
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,620
is more useful than the email because

460
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,780
email you're dealing with time zones and

461
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,889
things like that all the time and you're

462
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,330
not going to get a whole lot of sleep

463
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,340
while you're doing this because you have

464
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,340
to operate on their time zones in most

465
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,310
cases to maximize your communication and

466
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,470
you don't want to let communications lag

467
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,879
and you don't want to let let them go to

468
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,200
sleep because they're dealing with lots

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,060
of lots of victims at a time and you

470
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,450
don't want them to put you at the bottom

471
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:47,629
of their priority stack once you finally

472
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,330
do get your act together and you you are

473
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:55,190
ready to transact funds on behalf of a

474
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,960
client and the last one air is just you

475
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,610
know I think it's kind of cute in here

476
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,890
they're giving you little heads up a

477
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,740
little security awareness on how not to

478
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,030
damage further damage your files

479
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,040
one of the interesting things a lot of

480
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,960
cases you're able to take those files

481
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,330
off of a hard drive and drop them onto a

482
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,809
virtual space and and still recover them

483
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,760
so it's kind of a moot point but it is

484
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,070
pretty interesting now here's a bit

485
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,129
Paymer splash screen and it's a little

486
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,889
bit different because when you hit the

487
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,490
screen and it pops up it shows you

488
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:31,640
exactly what you are gonna owe them

489
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,260
coming back to the phobos you'll notice

490
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,010
in there you don't know how much euro

491
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,809
you owe them yet you won't the clock

492
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,910
really won't start ticking for you until

493
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,490
you reach out to one of those email

494
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:46,700
addresses up top and you tell them eh I

495
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,679
got this on my computer and it said to

496
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,750
reach out to you how much do I owe ya or

497
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,700
you know what what do I need to do you

498
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,830
know you kind of play it dumb and we'll

499
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,470
talk about that in the back-and-forth

500
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,439
and the messaging but bitpay Murs one

501
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,690
where it it shows you exactly how much

502
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,000
they're demanding right up front it

503
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,250
gives you their wallet information it

504
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,500
shows you your reference ID you put that

505
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,780
in an email to them you go out to their

506
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,160
wallet you can verify that that wallet

507
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,870
is active and they're just waiting for

508
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,760
you to drop money in there in this

509
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,850
instance here they're asking for ten

510
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,640
Bitcoin and here's my contact email so

511
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,169
you can also email me or you can use

512
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,900
that chat in the very bottom right

513
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,230
corner on that first half of the pane

514
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,270
that proves to be probably the most

515
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,660
effective form of communications that

516
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:39,770
you'll you'll use emails are great but

517
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,920
the online chat is extremely useful in

518
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:46,309
these cases especially when you get an

519
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:49,640
idea of you know the time differential

520
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:52,580
are they four hours six hours in front

521
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,100
of you you know when when do they answer

522
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,540
the first time usually and when's the

523
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,730
last time you hear from you can start

524
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,220
putting that association matrix together

525
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,900
as to where they might be regionally and

526
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,830
then you can pull a lot of it out of

527
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,390
there out of their vernacular as well

528
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,300
for me I like this you know keep a lot

529
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,220
of screens heads up on my machine when

530
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,590
I'm having any kind of conversation even

531
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,059
if I'm just having conversation with

532
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,510
them so I want to make sure like VPNs

533
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,410
not

534
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:24,410
down not down and using encrypted

535
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,910
browsers a good idea obviously and it

536
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,890
just creates another layer of protection

537
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,380
for you because here I'm using my

538
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,050
machine I might be at home or I might be

539
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,430
on client side at my hotel or wherever

540
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,129
that might be but I don't want to give

541
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,770
away any kind of detail about me if I

542
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:44,720
don't have to any needles machines and

543
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,910
so you know keeping up their blockchain

544
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,890
I like to look at their their wallet as

545
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,410
well to see if they're also receiving

546
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,880
transactions elsewhere are they getting

547
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,020
a whole lot of money running in there

548
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
and all of a sudden you know they're

549
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,520
only looking for a few bitcoins for me

550
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,700
but I'm watching you know a hundred and

551
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,410
fifty bitcoins transact through this

552
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,290
wallet a day you know these folks don't

553
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,790
need my money but how bad does the

554
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,730
client need their data back and those

555
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:13,040
types of things and so or you know are

556
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,870
they asking me for one Bitcoin and I

557
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,580
don't watch any money transact that

558
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,540
there's there's two reasons why either

559
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:23,000
they're you know they stood that wallet

560
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,700
up today and you can you can verify you

561
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,350
know when it was stood up and you know

562
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,930
if they're smart they're only using one

563
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,429
wallet per victim and they spin up

564
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,960
another wallet for each one of their

565
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,290
victims but they might be dealing with

566
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,370
you know twenty or thirty victims in any

567
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,200
given time so you know again it all

568
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,300
depends and every one of them seems to

569
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,520
be a little bit different then I have a

570
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,590
working browser in there where I can do

571
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,600
some you know heads up research without

572
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,010
having to jump screens and things like

573
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,280
that around there so when you send out

574
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:01,520
in that phobos message and you send that

575
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,980
email back out to them you get that

576
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,900
first response back and it tells them

577
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,320
that that's what it tells you hey I

578
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,930
decrypted all your files you need to pay

579
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,450
1.8 bitcoins in this instance here this

580
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,670
was just a couple months ago where that

581
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,460
was about twelve thousand dollars at the

582
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,990
time at the current exchange rate twelve

583
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,600
thousand sixty three dollars I think it

584
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,940
was is what it was and and then it gives

585
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,969
you all the instructions all the way

586
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,590
down the line in the very bottom you can

587
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,150
see the email that I sent to them is

588
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,159
very

589
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,620
bored very professional remember it's a

590
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,020
business transaction it's its business

591
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,340
to them you don't need to play games you

592
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,160
don't want to you know use a lot of

593
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,809
slang and and and street slang and

594
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,120
things like that and try to you know

595
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,320
Google leach speak because that's not

596
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,540
who you're dealing with in most cases

597
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,280
you know you want to do some research on

598
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,960
you know in the background you've got

599
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,030
somebody in your team that's either

600
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
yourself or somebody else who's skilled

601
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,510
in forensics you want to be able to

602
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,090
start pulling some data off of there

603
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,590
looking at you know indicators of

604
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,689
compromise and see what you're dealing

605
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,780
with and make sure that you actually do

606
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,600
have you know a specific family or a

607
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,550
variety of ransomware as opposed to

608
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,809
having a false indicator or somebody

609
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:21,070
just is playing games with you and has

610
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:24,160
messed around with your machine and then

611
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,530
drops you know and index file in there

612
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,360
like that which has happened in the past

613
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:31,030
and it really scares the hell out of

614
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,669
people so you're looking at and and it's

615
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,830
very clear when you drop them into

616
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:39,820
places like virustotal

617
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:42,250
or you can go to you know any run and

618
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,189
you can drop one of those executables or

619
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,650
even the binary into a Windows machine

620
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,360
and watch that thing spin up and watch

621
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,550
you know what happens it's a great

622
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,159
demonstration platform and you can do

623
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,809
this if you don't have your own

624
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,880
capabilities in your own environment or

625
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,260
you're anxious about doing that and

626
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,460
spinning up a virtual machine and

627
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,800
watching it blow up you or you can do

628
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,410
that yourself right there online and

629
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:13,200
drop it into an environment like that so

630
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:13,200
it's a great resource to have bookmarked

631
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,070
so that was you know coming back to that

632
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:22,290
business transaction that was my email

633
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:25,090
back to them is you know you spin up

634
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,500
either fire mail proton whatever you

635
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,570
know any kind of account a burner

636
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,929
account that you can use for that

637
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:34,240
instance and you know I'm I'm one of

638
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,179
them for that that sake of that

639
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,340
discussion remember the first

640
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,950
conversation you have with that client

641
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,800
is going to be you know there's

642
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,750
absolutely no way that I'm

643
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,610
hanging a ransom on here so we got to do

644
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,000
everything that we can do well when you

645
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:54,189
start running down that whole chain of

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,810
events with them and you say look do you

647
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,210
have any way of being able to recover

648
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,500
that data do you have any backups local

649
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,830
do you have them in the cloud is there

650
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,110
any possible way and you've exhausted

651
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,780
all those resources then you start

652
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,629
having that math conversation with the

653
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,550
you know the the c-suite of how much

654
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,560
would it cost you to reconstitute and

655
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,730
rebuild all of that critical data that

656
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,230
you lost because you don't need

657
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,810
everything you just need the critical

658
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:23,190
nuggets how much would it cost you and

659
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,720
if that number is more than what that

660
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,370
ransom is then you start having to have

661
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,300
that next conversation with well it

662
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,010
might be logistically you know and

663
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,639
economically better for you to maybe pay

664
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,950
that take your chances and recover that

665
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,800
data that we scrub it we carve it off

666
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,960
and then we blow up all your instances

667
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,500
of your active environment that was

668
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,250
compromised and the replace drives or

669
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,510
machines that they're you know

670
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,470
completely dead in the water and that

671
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,020
type of thing so you had those

672
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,300
conversations but you know it takes you

673
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,790
back to this point here when okay you

674
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,399
grow on through that entire exercise yes

675
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,830
it is necessary for us to to go ahead

676
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,430
and do that we received that response

677
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,449
back from them and now the clock starts

678
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,390
ticking when you're dealing with

679
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,550
something like Phobos where you've now

680
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,260
learned the destiny and how much it's

681
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,110
going to cost then you go back to them

682
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,490
is this something you can deal with it's

683
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:23,379
it's almost like going to a flea market

684
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:26,350
you can almost always ask for half at a

685
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:29,170
minimum and in most cases as long as

686
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:32,290
you're keeping that conversation alive I

687
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:35,230
like to play the you know poor country

688
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,470
boy type of conversation with a lot of

689
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,180
them and and you know we're just you'll

690
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,220
see some of my conversation here we're

691
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,750
just a poor rural school we're just

692
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,970
trying to look out for the kids and that

693
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:50,710
type of thing so you know but as you as

694
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,370
you get down to the the conversation

695
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:56,140
here you know you say well alright we're

696
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,510
thinking about it I've talked to the

697
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,840
leadership in the meantime you want to

698
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,610
keep the

699
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,470
conversational I'm now the clock is

700
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,090
tickin with him so this is the time that

701
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,640
you want to go ahead and throw them some

702
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,199
files and you send them some file that

703
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,490
doesn't have any kind of critical data

704
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,230
in it you don't want to send them your

705
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,660
password lists and now I can get into

706
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,500
all my systems because the IT guy you

707
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,210
know is AWOL but you want to you want to

708
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,860
send them those files and then they're

709
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,130
gonna send them back to you in most

710
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,750
cases yeah they send you a link and I

711
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,430
like this one here because this is a

712
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,190
pretty interesting password that they

713
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,620
chose they believe in strong passwords

714
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,900
you know we always kid get around you

715
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,340
know when we find some some you know

716
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,840
botnets out there or something like that

717
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,760
they don't even protect the botnets

718
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,159
themselves and they've got a default

719
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,420
password in their infrastructure a lot

720
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,700
of times but when they choose a password

721
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:49,330
like that maybe they thought we were

722
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,680
just the poor bumpkin company at the

723
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:57,070
time but I don't think that's the case

724
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:59,470
you'll see in a moment so goes back to

725
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,929
the don't play games with them you know

726
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,270
here's there's one instance where yeah

727
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:07,090
I'm just telling them we're a small you

728
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:10,930
know management company and this is

729
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:14,830
where they were asking for 1.8 you know

730
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:17,620
Bitcoin which is $12,000 and they did

731
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:20,199
have a rule with their board members

732
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,659
that the general manager could not allow

733
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,550
I could not spend anything more than 55

734
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,430
thousand dollars without calling

735
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,710
together a board board meeting in for

736
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,420
them to vote to vote on it and so rather

737
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,180
than having to call up an emergency

738
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,740
board meeting to go through that whole

739
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,110
thing he's like hey let's go ahead and

740
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,500
just put that back to them and offer it

741
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,479
up and see what they say and so when we

742
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,950
did that they did say hey yeah you know

743
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,410
what we'll take fifty five hundred

744
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:50,350
dollars is the least amount that we can

745
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,730
take and you know and then you start

746
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,639
going off from there and you can see I

747
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,100
tried playing the whole you know poor us

748
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,110
you know look at our small handful of

749
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,840
employees here we're a small development

750
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,689
they rely on us to be up and operating

751
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,100
and you know kind of play the old and

752
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,230
come on do it for the kids and I even

753
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,399
through the kovat in there

754
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,970
but yeah we still

755
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,430
ended up now on the other side this is

756
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,260
one where I may have taken a little bit

757
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,420
of a heavy hand with them and saying hey

758
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,830
you know it's unfortunate you make it

759
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,760
you've mistaken us for a large

760
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,500
corporation yes maybe wasn't the right

761
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,250
way to go well it clearly wasn't the

762
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,840
right way to go we're at rule school and

763
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,900
they did hit a school district was a

764
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,310
pretty big school district and you can

765
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,170
see the rest of it I won't read it to

766
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,580
your verbatim but you know I tried

767
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,200
playing it down hey we're just real

768
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,379
small we just want to make sure that we

769
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,870
focus on the kids in this rule town and

770
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:51,120
their response back was an email with an

771
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,719
attachment that had the financials from

772
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,429
the previous year you know let them know

773
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,560
look I was in your system I know how

774
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:01,170
much your budget is I know how much your

775
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,090
expenditures were and it's just a drop

776
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:06,930
in the bucket for what I'm asking you

777
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:09,080
here and we did end up negotiating it

778
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:15,030
down there yeah they asked for 10 and

779
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:17,550
they agreed on three I went back to him

780
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,590
after we got that message back and I

781
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,389
said hey can we please discuss it and

782
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,419
this is where we're in that chat window

783
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,170
and you catch them online you just keep

784
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,550
it going back and forth with them and

785
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,800
you know I said hey you said to reach

786
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,419
out to you discuss the price and I'm

787
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,490
still kind of played that we're still

788
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,100
small and he was just very

789
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,420
matter-of-fact so what's your offer yeah

790
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,129
I don't care about all the sob story

791
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:46,020
what's your offer and you know this is

792
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,000
what I stalled for a little bit more

793
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,770
time with them and say hey I can't make

794
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,050
a legitimate offer without going to the

795
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,210
board he said so discuss it and then you

796
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:57,389
know do it well we were rolling into the

797
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,730
4th of July weekend at that at that time

798
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,590
so he said all right you've got until

799
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,110
Monday so we did buy a little bit more

800
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,459
time in that instance and one of the

801
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:08,669
things important is to keep that

802
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,650
conversation alive so every day I sent

803
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,930
them at least two messages just to let

804
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,870
them know hey just to let you know we're

805
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,340
still working it and I'm waiting on the

806
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,320
board and hopefully they're they're

807
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,760
gonna be able to find everybody and pull

808
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,220
them all together and we're gonna get a

809
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,240
decision even sooner than we had

810
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,870
expected and so

811
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,010
kind of kept that going and finally I

812
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,320
told him I said hey I've been offered a

813
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:36,270
grant approved to offer you one Bitcoin

814
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,439
and still trying to beg and plead and

815
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,960
you have to swallow your pride in a lot

816
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,480
of cases because you're you know here I

817
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,050
have a grown man trying to beg and plead

818
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,760
for mercy and you feel like you know

819
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,350
geez I feel like I'm just you know

820
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,870
cowering down to them in a lot of cases

821
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:55,360
but remember you're doing this on behalf

822
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:58,330
of an entire community or whoever that

823
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,629
that client is at the time and so you

824
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,590
can see the response back and forth in

825
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:09,550
there one of the things that I'd ask and

826
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:13,080
it's not captured on this is can you can

827
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:15,910
you take a smaller amount right now and

828
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,469
give us the encryption keys for just a

829
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,109
few of the machines because it's really

830
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:22,270
important we get payroll and that hold

831
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,400
nine yards and then you can you know

832
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,500
when we can get the rest of the money we

833
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,940
can pay out the rest of it then you

834
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,199
could give us another key to give us the

835
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,720
rest of data that's where he was

836
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,580
explaining now it's it's one key to

837
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:37,509
crypts everything so it's it's a

838
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:41,549
one-and-done kind of deal so you can see

839
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:43,200
how that went and then

840
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,270
it's important not to make promises you

841
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,189
can't keep you can't say that yep okay

842
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,899
Monday I'm gonna move this money and

843
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:53,159
it's going to definitely happen on that

844
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:55,859
day it's you know I'm gonna try we're

845
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:00,750
gonna we're gonna attempt it I always

846
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:03,240
use the kind of the the soft messaging

847
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,400
the passive voice that this is my first

848
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,799
time hey we don't do this very often you

849
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,300
know we don't we don't have a Bitcoin

850
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,710
account I don't even know what bitcoin

851
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,110
is before this all happened

852
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,150
and you know we finally got the money in

853
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,310
the account but it was being delayed

854
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,170
because it was a new count stood up and

855
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,420
then you know so I asked him just to try

856
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:28,020
to keep the conversation alive is this

857
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:31,770
common and yeah so this is kind of

858
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,300
coming back to the the other case where

859
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:37,740
we'll do our best to move that money

860
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:40,080
just kind of keeping it you know passive

861
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,240
but at the same time it's not me doing

862
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,509
this it's us as a collective team

863
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,479
because I'm representing a large you

864
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:51,090
know organization and so it's not just

865
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,590
me they didn't just hit a single person

866
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,730
and that way they'd understand that

867
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,680
they're not just dealing with one person

868
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:59,850
I don't have decision-making authority

869
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,569
and so I always try to put it in that

870
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,880
way

871
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:08,130
versus I you know you hit me you you you

872
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,600
put me in this predicament it's it's us

873
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:15,480
and we type of thing so you get to the

874
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,200
point where you've been watching your

875
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,180
heads-up display and you you finally

876
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,649
transact that money it drops into their

877
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,600
account you watch their wallet transact

878
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,080
the funds and then it populates with you

879
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,850
know whatever the the volume was this is

880
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,710
a response that you get with the bid

881
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:38,759
Paymer which is pretty interesting and

882
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:41,760
comical from an investigator perspective

883
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,650
because at the end of the day they're

884
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,359
trying to help you protect your network

885
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:49,770
further down the road they try to tell

886
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,960
you that they don't intend to come back

887
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,670
or something like that but they give you

888
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,440
a little security awareness but they

889
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,720
also teach you how to

890
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,520
the tool itself but the interesting

891
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,839
piece is very end I've highlighted it

892
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,540
there they point you to Jim shavers Mimi

893
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,910
Katz

894
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,800
blogpost back in 2016 defending against

895
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:14,009
mini cats and so when you click on that

896
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,599
you end up jumping to Jim's page there

897
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,599
which is pretty interesting many of us

898
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,849
have read it over the years but you know

899
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,319
they're they're kind of giving you an

900
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,970
exit security awareness breathing hey

901
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:26,279
knuckleheads here's how I here's how I

902
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,430
did it in a lot of cases you know we

903
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,540
find that that phobos's attack vector is

904
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:35,819
through 3389 with open RDP and that's

905
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,170
where you know it's extremely important

906
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:39,930
to stress that the folks you know hey

907
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,180
look this is this is how we we see that

908
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,598
they got in and it's important to be

909
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,368
able to capture you know a lot of that

910
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,990
perimeter information like the logs and

911
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,369
all that traffic like that because one

912
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,439
of the questions that the board members

913
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,260
or any investors or any of the SI

914
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,940
squeezer gasps was this an inside job or

915
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,520
if somebody hit us from the outside how

916
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,609
did they get in what happened and they

917
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,980
want to know the full forensic story of

918
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:08,369
what happened and did anything

919
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,829
exfiltrate my perimeter and and that's

920
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,839
you know where you can or you can't

921
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:14,730
answer the question depending on what

922
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:16,560
available information you have because

923
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,010
the last act that attacker is going to

924
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,290
do before they exit rate your system is

925
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,579
they're going to delete any logs and

926
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,009
they're gonna pick up all the crumbs

927
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,680
that they can on the way out and so they

928
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,990
delete a lot of those logs and in a lot

929
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,118
of cases because your encrypted and your

930
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,890
your full disk encryption now in a lot

931
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,950
of cases you don't have the ability to

932
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,440
recover that so it's hit and miss and

933
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,589
especially if they you know are hit you

934
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,599
at your edge and you didn't have a an

935
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,799
independent firewall not a cases a lot

936
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,599
of these small to medium-sized

937
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,160
businesses it's not the case yeah I had

938
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,020
a server and it had some firewall

939
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,799
logging up my printers got firewall on

940
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,569
its off it's probably okay right you can

941
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,520
see where they're standing so it's

942
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:02,880
extremely important to be able to pull

943
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,640
that forensics information for them to

944
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,660
be able to do that analysis to say you

945
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,640
can't say to your investors that nothing

946
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,680
left our perimeter so that transitions

947
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,750
you know to the type of conversation

948
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,308
when they go public and it's extremely

949
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:20,240
important for them to be transparent

950
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:22,690
with regards to what's happened and the

951
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,770
last thing they want to do is lie

952
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,030
intentionally you know withholding some

953
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,759
that information because we all know

954
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,319
that that first report is always wrong

955
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,970
and it's just you know what's that

956
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:33,529
second report going to hold is it going

957
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:38,950
to be a hundred eighty degrees on that

958
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:44,119
story this is this is just kind of

959
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:46,339
Toni's joy in all this as a hunter and

960
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,170
an investigator I like to know where

961
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:51,170
this money is going I try to chase that

962
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,690
money as long as I can after the

963
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,970
transaction has been made that's part of

964
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,910
why I keep that wallet up because you

965
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:02,118
can chase the trail to a certain degree

966
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:06,140
you can see in this instance here where

967
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:09,170
our wallet makes the payment to the

968
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,089
attacker and then the attacker starts

969
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,039
breaking that up right away and he

970
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:15,950
starts carving that money up and he's

971
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:19,160
break it into the you know 2.2 4 then

972
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,509
0.75 and then each of those start

973
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,279
running down their trails and they're

974
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,799
either paying out or they're washing it

975
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:27,650
a little bit of both but they'll start

976
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:30,500
you know kind of laundering or blending

977
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,020
that money so that it's obfuscated a

978
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,930
little bit deeper in case Secret Service

979
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,270
or anybody else is trying to track them

980
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,160
hard but in most cases they're paying

981
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,230
out anybody that's on their team and

982
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,470
that's usually that smaller bucket on

983
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:47,599
there where they're they're paying

984
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,459
people out and then you can chase those

985
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,349
trails down as far as you go and then

986
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,910
you finally lose track of them so it's

987
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,160
difficult at best and there's a lot of

988
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,339
folks who just you know when you when

989
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,839
you lock on to a wallet they want you to

990
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:01,880
throw them the wallet and they'll do all

991
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,859
that in the background you can't eat up

992
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,250
your time you know hunting and chasing

993
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:08,900
that down the road but here's kind of a

994
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,720
blow-up if you couldn't see it very well

995
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,839
on your screen of that larger

996
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,189
transaction and that larger slice as

997
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:21,859
they were beginning to blow it out so

998
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,520
once you've got your money transacted

999
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:25,190
and you got

1000
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:29,380
the keys now then you start depending on

1001
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:33,260
the type of decryption tools that you

1002
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:36,080
ransomware that you have you begin

1003
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,600
decrypting it your conversation with the

1004
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,700
attacker in a lot of cases isn't over

1005
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,180
you have to maintain coms with them

1006
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,750
because in some instances you receive a

1007
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,379
file you download it and you executed on

1008
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,970
the encrypted files or the machine and

1009
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,310
you're done you're done conversation

1010
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:58,129
with conversation with them in the case

1011
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:00,380
of Phobos that's not the case you end up

1012
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:04,820
having to run and I'll kind of walk you

1013
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,410
through you run the tool on the

1014
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,360
respective drive

1015
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:12,129
hey you just you know scroll to the

1016
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,450
drive and you're either looking at a a

1017
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,770
directory or you're just doing a full

1018
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:19,879
disk itself and drop it in here and

1019
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:23,150
you're scanning it and then what it does

1020
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,660
is it drops the hash back to you well

1021
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:29,869
let me back up here and you email that

1022
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,509
hash back to the attacker and then they

1023
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:35,570
send you another hash for the decryption

1024
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,720
and you pick that hash up at their drop

1025
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:41,930
site and then once you receive that hash

1026
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,379
you drop it back into the tool and then

1027
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,109
you decrypt that specific instance in

1028
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,560
that machine every machine has its own

1029
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:53,480
unique signature that you have to do so

1030
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,619
if you've got an entire instance and a

1031
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,050
company that's got a hundred machines

1032
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:00,140
you're doing this transaction with

1033
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,690
Phobos a hundred times so that's why

1034
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,629
it's important to segment out a where's

1035
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:08,630
my critical day is just my my financial

1036
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,760
server is in my core server do I need to

1037
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,950
hit all of my end-user machines you know

1038
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,730
do I have the ability to do that do I

1039
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,109
care

1040
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,670
so you really have to have those

1041
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:18,440
conversations because that can really be

1042
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,890
time-consuming because once you let that

1043
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,160
conversation die for you know a half a

1044
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,270
day or a day they're gone and they're

1045
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,830
not coming back they've already got

1046
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,020
their money there's no priority for them

1047
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:33,140
to you know make sure that you're taking

1048
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,950
care of cleaning house it's speaking of

1049
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,960
cleaning house

1050
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,470
you know once you've gone into that

1051
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,329
server

1052
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:42,879
you pull off of that you know or that

1053
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:45,020
machine that's got that critical data

1054
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,140
it's interesting a lot of times to see

1055
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:52,579
what is left there and which artifacts

1056
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:55,069
are are left behind and what value add

1057
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:57,859
or gifts they gave you and you can see

1058
00:43:55,069 --> 00:44:01,790
in this instance here there's a variant

1059
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:04,420
of a Bitcoin miner that's you know left

1060
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,770
in there even after all of the

1061
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,800
ransomware is removed through the

1062
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,270
Decrypter so it leaves a bit there and

1063
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,690
that's why we always had that

1064
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:16,910
conversation with well I've decrypted it

1065
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:19,369
I'm back to operations thanks a lot guys

1066
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:22,879
go away it's not that you now you've got

1067
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:25,040
to go ahead and and scrub that pertinent

1068
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,970
data off and then you're starting over

1069
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,640
with fresh drives in some instances it's

1070
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,589
time to refresh your hardware as well

1071
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,089
because that was legacy Hardware anyway

1072
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:36,290
it's that time to go ahead if you're

1073
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:39,560
going to go through that effort let's

1074
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:42,470
just go ahead and you know build out new

1075
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,839
instances or let's just you know migrate

1076
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:47,299
you to the cloud or wherever that might

1077
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,130
be depending on your deployment but you

1078
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,589
know it's important to reach in there

1079
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,060
and clean that up and blow up those

1080
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:58,880
machines if they've got a little bit of

1081
00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:00,529
a disciplined capability in there I talk

1082
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,540
like this wouldn't be valuable unless

1083
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,430
you know kind of what do we see in the

1084
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,839
horizon you know ransomware is gonna

1085
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,940
continue to grow it's not going away

1086
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,130
anytime soon you know regardless of what

1087
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,920
you heard back in 2018 when they said eh

1088
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,050
2019 it's gonna start fading away then

1089
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,849
you had that little downturn it's almost

1090
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:18,290
like the corona right it's it's gonna

1091
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:20,420
downturn then it's probably gonna come

1092
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:22,670
back up for a lot of folks in some areas

1093
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:25,579
because they're getting out ahead of

1094
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:29,720
themselves well you know we're already

1095
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:31,760
seeing a lot of the the fireless attacks

1096
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,890
out there where you're not clicking on a

1097
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,869
PDF that sent to you an email it's

1098
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:39,200
happening with those apps that I talked

1099
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:42,319
to you up front about and then you're

1100
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,509
also seeing instances where some of the

1101
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,930
teams are saying look you know if you

1102
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:50,150
play games and you refuse to pay then

1103
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,819
we're gonna dump your data

1104
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,099
out there in public domain and so daxing

1105
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:58,670
your victims is extremely important for

1106
00:45:55,099 --> 00:46:00,589
the the victims out there to understand

1107
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,299
when they ask that question you know

1108
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:04,069
well did they excellent rate anything

1109
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:06,380
it's highly likely that they have

1110
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:08,240
excellent rated that data from your

1111
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,430
network already because they wouldn't be

1112
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,700
able to Doc's you if that's not the case

1113
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:15,558
so and it's going to get bigger and

1114
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,819
bigger they're they're already targeting

1115
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,029
you know large financial institutions

1116
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:21,529
and and hospitals especially in these

1117
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:22,910
critical times it's pathetic to see

1118
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:25,910
those types of things but I've dealt

1119
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:28,578
with three cases alone just over the the

1120
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,890
period that we've been you know quasi

1121
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:32,930
quarantined and that's not always the

1122
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,390
case when you're doing something like

1123
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,680
this but the fact the matter is it's

1124
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,868
going to get worse before it gets better

1125
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,629
and you know you're already seeing

1126
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:45,440
instances you know even prior to the the

1127
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:48,380
new year of people dumping people's

1128
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,970
creds and and access to their machines

1129
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:54,829
as well as their internals out there I

1130
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:58,250
think last week there was a there was an

1131
00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:05,750
instance where an Israeli group dumped a

1132
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:08,299
bunch of folks well is that your end of

1133
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:11,480
speech timer no that was that was mine

1134
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:13,009
yeah that was that was mine no I put my

1135
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,779
little heads up to myself over here so

1136
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,730
let it run over trying to be respectful

1137
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:19,279
of rush hour I know anybody got drive

1138
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:21,010
home to the refrigerator yeah yeah

1139
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:25,549
pretty much I already made my way there

1140
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:26,960
so I'll leave you with this you know if

1141
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:28,309
there's you know there's always those

1142
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,400
lists of here are the top things you

1143
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:33,980
need to be doing really we're all doing

1144
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,799
MFA we all should be thinking about it

1145
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:39,289
if you're not but the reality is if

1146
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:41,930
there's one thing that a company needs

1147
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:44,270
to invest their money in is three to one

1148
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,759
resilient backup recovery strategy and

1149
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:49,640
and practice practice practice give the

1150
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,260
confidence to the IT teams even when

1151
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,270
they've got an effective solution in

1152
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,010
place if they haven't practiced that

1153
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,420
there's an extreme amount of anxiety

1154
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,430
when they push that button the first

1155
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:01,549
time and if you've been there you can

1156
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,868
speak to it it's it's extremely anxious

1157
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,500
for those those folks out there

1158
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:06,560
everything

1159
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,780
else in there is traditional you know

1160
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,390
administrative housekeeping good

1161
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:15,830
networking security and and taking care

1162
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:19,040
of business but with that I'll let you

1163
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:21,230
guys get back to lay Tony I've got we've

1164
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,779
got one question on the line for you

1165
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:26,210
have you had cases where you have made

1166
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,300
negotiations sent the payment and then

1167
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:31,610
receive nothing from the attacker how do

1168
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,190
you avoid the risk or at least

1169
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,970
communicate it to the client the risk

1170
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:40,280
that they might pay and not get anything

1171
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:42,589
that's that's a great question and it's

1172
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,780
an upfront conversation because as soon

1173
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:49,100
as you start having that conversation

1174
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,870
with them that okay you know we've we've

1175
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,390
determined that we can't recover your

1176
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,190
data you don't have any backups there's

1177
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,609
no way to rebuild this that's very

1178
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,950
unique

1179
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,720
you know one-off data and there's no

1180
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,910
other way to get it back unless you

1181
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,910
reach out to who your attacker was and

1182
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:07,460
try to try to do this their question is

1183
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:09,740
usually alright so if I pay this no

1184
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,120
matter what the price is I'm guaranteed

1185
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,029
I'm going to get it back and the answer

1186
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,259
is always you can't guarantee anything

1187
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:17,120
in that and so you have to make sure

1188
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,310
it's very clear them and they're not

1189
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,850
trying to hold you liable for that as

1190
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,440
well it's a huge risk you do see all

1191
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:26,540
over the press a lot of instances where

1192
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,270
they're not paid out but I'll tell you

1193
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:32,570
I've done this for for quite a while and

1194
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:34,670
it's in the mid 90s you know low to mid

1195
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,770
90s that they're paying out and so it

1196
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,570
does happen but it's a very rare

1197
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,550
occasion these days that was more you

1198
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,190
know three four years ago and you can

1199
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,020
usually tell by the time you get to that

1200
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,150
point that you're ready to transact

1201
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:50,810
funds if you're dealing with somebody

1202
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:53,960
who's mature organization or a kitty who

1203
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:56,150
downloaded a piece of software and we

1204
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,830
have one other question just curious

1205
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,080
have you dealt with an issue where the

1206
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:04,970
entire network and shared device were

1207
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:07,069
encrypted yes yeah and so that's those

1208
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:10,279
instances where you know you're not

1209
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,900
spinning anything up and and and that's

1210
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,280
you know one of the conversations we

1211
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,910
have with a lot of folks on there as

1212
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,070
when we do assessments and pen tests is

1213
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:22,250
you know the make sure that your your

1214
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,020
backup and storage is not binded to your

1215
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,700
domain in a lot of those cases because

1216
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,400
it's crawling the domain or any of those

1217
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,379
domain attachments are are being

1218
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,100
encrypted as well even when you push

1219
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:36,470
them up into your your off-site storage

1220
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,420
and we're seeing those so you know in

1221
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,859
some some cases that's kind of comical

1222
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,810
because you'll see in and you know were

1223
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,580
the last pen test report that we got was

1224
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:46,759
that we got gigged on it because it

1225
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,799
wasn't we didn't have it bound well it's

1226
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,900
it's actually a good thing these days

1227
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,870
because it's it's giving you kind of a

1228
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,880
gap in in some instances but that's

1229
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,680
where you start rolling into the RA

1230
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,080
let's find those critical machines and

1231
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,230
let's try to do a forensic recovery of

1232
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,810
those machines just like we might try to

1233
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:09,530
you know do a disaster recovery for a

1234
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:11,779
drive that's crashed it looks like we

1235
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:15,200
have someone put in one more question

1236
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:17,540
they're an inquisitive folk so when is

1237
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,560
it better to refuse the payment or is it

1238
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,560
never a good option

1239
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:29,840
you're talking about refuse life use to

1240
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:32,340
pay the ransom so yeah that's a great

1241
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,260
topic of discussion it really it turns

1242
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,570
into a heated discussion so if you

1243
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,670
remember about November of last year a

1244
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:40,920
bunch of Mayors all across the country

1245
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:42,450
and to date I think it's well over a

1246
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,850
hundred there's something different

1247
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,879
mayor's around the country have put

1248
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:50,130
together this letter and they signed the

1249
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,740
letter saying there we will not pay

1250
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:56,040
ransom we're under any circumstances and

1251
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,779
I shout out to the mayor of a couple of

1252
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,730
cities that I do business with regularly

1253
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,620
and I said good luck with that because I

1254
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:04,860
know what your network looks like and

1255
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:08,910
you're gonna fail hard when it comes

1256
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:11,100
time to address that because if you

1257
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:13,259
can't recover and you and I talked to

1258
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,990
these these IT guys a lot of times and I

1259
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,460
go man we think we have it but we

1260
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,680
haven't exercise it well let's sit down

1261
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,930
and exercise it you've got to have the

1262
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,620
confidence and ability to recover that

1263
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:28,529
and your IT team has to have the

1264
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,720
confidence in themselves and and to just

1265
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,760
arbitrarily say there's absolutely no

1266
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,220
way that we're gonna pay it you know

1267
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,100
it's you tongue in cheek you just have

1268
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,330
to say good luck with that because it's

1269
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:43,110
you have to be willing to have that

1270
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:45,360
conversation you know at least ask if if

1271
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:49,200
you've got no other option because what

1272
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:52,440
are you gonna do and Tony the masses are

1273
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,819
asking for your slide deck yeah I'm

1274
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:01,530
