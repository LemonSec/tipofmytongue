so if everyone is having a good day so

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,349
far and a little bit about myself I'm

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,649

pentesting cert

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,579
I'm a senior red team lead at a large

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,140
consumer product company imagine

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,780
professor Richland College I teach

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,640
ethical hacking and web app pentesting

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,350
and I'm also the founder of the pone

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,230
school project teaching got me

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,809
interested in expanding my teaching

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,288
outside of the classroom doing workshops

22
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,809
and doing meetups and we actually stream

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,820
these talks to we started streaming last

24
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,259
year and fortunately with all the

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,409
quarantine stuff were able to still

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,540
operate as well as my classes I've been

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,240
in InfoSec and i.t for a little over 22

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,070
years spent my first six and a half

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,630
years six plus years as a system

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,330
administrator I like to go through this

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,009
in detail because you know this talk is

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,689
how to become a pen tester in your

33
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,640
background so you can kind of see my

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:29,548
background for the past 16 plus years I

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,829
worked well for 16 have 16 plus years I

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,140
worked in security a knapsack the last

37
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,240
eight plus years and pen testing my

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,070
first five years were in consulting I

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,539
highly recommend consulting if you ever

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,369
get the chance to do it because you get

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,049
to learn it at an accelerated pace I

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,409
don't feel like I'd be where I'm at

43
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,840
without that experience and I'm also the

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,240
co-host of a new web podcast series that

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,110
just started here recently the uncommon

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,509
journey and it's hosted by itsp magazine

47
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,640
so check us out we talked to different

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,070
people in security and they share their

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,380
story how they got in and kind of like

50
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,329
my story not everyone got in so

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,019
straightforward

52
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,450
my path to InfoSec was pro wrestling

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,860
when I graduate from high school I had

54
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,690
no plans in my

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,190
friends you know said you know since

56
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,740
you're a power through your big guy why

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,390
don't you be a pro-wrestler so I decided

58
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,860
to give it a chance

59
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,500
got married and had to find a more

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,570
stable career so I moved moved into CAD

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,870
drafting from there I found out about

62
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,750
sysadmin and from sysadmin I moved in

63
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,510
the InfoSec and then from there tent

64
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,420
testing and so back then whenever my

65
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,190
wrestling days I actually wrestled a 750

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,179
pound black bear but you can see

67
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:49,140
pictured in this slide this is a slide I

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,459
share each semester with my students and

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,738
also just to kind of give you more

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,190
detail on this talk this talk is based

71
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,450
on my first lecture of the semester so

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,959
one things I like didn't let everyone

73
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,929
knows you know well you know pen testing

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
or hacking with with permission is legal

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,100
but without it it's illegal you don't to

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,480
get yourself in trouble if you're in

77
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,370
security want to get into security it's

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,510
kind of hard to get jobs if you have a

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,489
felony on your record

80
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,750
so only hack if you have permission even

81
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,540
better written permission

82
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,140
hacking without permission is illegal

83
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,798
and quotes by Voltaire but my first

84
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,450
exposure to it was from spider-man Uncle

85
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,459
Ben Uncle Ben said with great power

86
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,079
comes great responsibility so we need to

87
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,489
remember this you know regardless of

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,790
your pen test or any other areas of

89
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,650
security

90
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,660
what is pen testing pen testing is

91
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,160
assessing security from adversarial

92
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,540
perspective attempting to exploit

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,180
vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized

94
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,230
access to systems and sensitive data a

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,820
lot of times people just think a root or

96
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,859
empty system Authority or domain admin

97
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,630
and when it comes down to it it's the

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,730
information that's the most important

99
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,440
part so pen testing gives you the

100
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,090
adversarial perspective as security you

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,500
better you have a better understanding

102
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,209
of the risk severity exploitable

103
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,220
vulnerabilities or high risk and a

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,350
higher priority for remediation as well

105
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,570
as justifying the budget sometimes

106
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,640
companies need a little more proof to

107
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,770
provide the budget to to remediate the

108
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,690
vulnerability and sometimes they just

109
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,039
don't you know just doing a

110
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,630
vulnerability scan is not enough so

111
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,180
understanding that it's

112
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,670
and there's a risk and gives them more

113
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,020
reason to remediate especially when some

114
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,400
vulnerabilities could you know it could

115
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,340
be very expensive it may not be

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,429
something like a simple HTTP header

117
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,869
change on a web server it could be

118
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,810
implementing some new firewalls or new

119
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,240
endpoint protection or something so this

120
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,320
information collected during a pen test

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,210
will give them better

122
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,050
ammunition to go get justification for

123
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,700
budgeting to remediate regulatory

124
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,030
compliance is a big driver for pen

125
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,159
testing pay payment card industry data

126
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,510
security standard PC PCI DSS

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,280
has been a large influence on pen

128
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,590
testing you have to have pen tests

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,330
performed to be compliant so this is

130
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,219
drawn a lot of work you see a lot of pen

131
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,650
testers and banks for this reason and a

132
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,940
lot of pen testing it's a fun job even

133
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,870
though I've been doing this for over

134
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,820
year over eight years

135
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,700
anytime I hack into something is still a

136
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,110
big thrill so it's a lot of fun it's a

137
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,150
pretty good area for opportunities

138
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,410
because although it's not a new field

139
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,659
there's been a lot of companies have

140
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,730
used consultants and contractors to do

141
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,330
their work and not everyone can afford

142
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,550
that much consulting time so it only

143
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,050
makes sense to bring in your own pen

144
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,360
test team so a lot of companies are

145
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,950
starting to add pen test teams if they

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,250
don't have one then there's a good

147
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,599
possibility that they will impair

148
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,600
testing jobs and kind of some of the

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,370
terms penetration testers the

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,060
professional term shortened to pen

151
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,200
tester sometimes this fall under

152
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,000
security consultants or analysts or

153
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,680
engineers so when you're looking for

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,810
jobs you may not be able to just clearly

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,010
find a job that says pen testing and so

156
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,170
you have to look through the job

157
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,260
description because sometimes HR can't

158
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,930
break down every single job into a job

159
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,120
class and all that so you just have to

160
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,860
be cognizant that it falls under

161
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,930
different titles you just have to look

162
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,360
at the job descriptions and see the

163
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,950
tools being used and the type of work to

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
give an idea of it's a pen testing job

165
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,190
sometimes the main title might be

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
something else but pen testing will be

167
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,490
related will be listed somewhere in that

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,169
description different words synonymous

169
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,100
with pen testing is ethical hackers

170
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,409
which is

171
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,990
more common one and more easy to explain

172
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,920
to the general public for those that are

173
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,590
not don't understand the term pentesting

174
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,870
offensive security adversarial security

175
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,989
are some terms that are widely used for

176
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,140
this this area of security threat and

177
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,190
vulnerability management is common

178
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,840
Department this falls under sometimes

179
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,360
sometimes it can be separate it could be

180
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,810
the vulnerability scan team may be under

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,370
this alone the remediation team but a

182
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,330
lot of cases this falls under threat and

183
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,220
vulnerability management contesting

184
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,479
skills in other areas this is not only

185
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,220
important to to pen testers it's

186
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,870
important to other areas and kind of

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,300
evidence of that is if you look at the

188
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,760
the mitre attack framework it discret

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,610
describes different apts

190
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,560
how these hacks happen and so that kind

191
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,790
of gives you the importance of this

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,160
knowledge so Sauk analyst network

193
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,190
engineers and security and network

194
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,710
security analyst being able to identify

195
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,500
malicious traffic is very important dfi

196
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,150
are people you know if you're responding

197
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,070
to an incident if you understand some of

198
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,080
the attacks it makes it easier makes

199
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,540
your job easier to do you'll understand

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,570
the attack patterns and and get a better

201
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,240
idea of how the certain system was

202
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,920
exploited and breached in purple teams

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,830
is kind of more of a newer thing and

204
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,270
this is where your offense and defensive

205
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,270
teams play together they work together

206
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,310
to improve the defenses so whereas you

207
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,700
could be doing your pen test and what

208
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,930
the blue team know what's going on and

209
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,840
they're there monitoring the traffic

210
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,210
then they can write better signatures to

211
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,710
detect that type of activity and this is

212
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,530
also a way to see how they're responding

213
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,090
as well as like red team engagements be

214
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,098
able to test the response and help

215
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,799
improve those areas and application

216
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,360
security this is a an area where these

217
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,770
skills are very handy understanding

218
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,219
those attacks are very important

219
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,990
understanding the OWASP top 10 in

220
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,510
applications security was where I got my

221
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,550
interest in pen testing I ran web app

222
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,220
vulnerability scans had no idea about

223
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,229
hacking but from that I learned about a

224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,990
loss of top 10 and the field of pen

225
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,120
testing this was back in like 2005 so

226
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,500
a lot less common back then so I found

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,630
out about pen testing and that's what

228
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,380
drove me to eventually want to become a

229
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,610
pen tester and we were doing a pen test

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,649
there's different types of targets

231
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,920
you're gonna be testing most commonly

232
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,230
you'll see networks and this could be

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,750
internal facing external and wireless

234
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,940
networks applications are very popular

235
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,279
to webapp thick client mobile and cloud

236
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,670
and then hardware and this can be your

237
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,770
network hardware this could be a IOT

238
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,149
this could be medical devices your

239
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,579
medical devices need to be secure

240
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,830
someone's able to breach

241
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,350
an insulin pump or something then they

242
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,820
could cause harm to someone even even

243
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,760
cause death

244
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,160
so that's reasons for these areas to be

245
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,689
tested transportation so with your

246
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,760
autonomous vehicles these self-driving

247
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,110
vehicles you need to make sure they're

248
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
secure because they give you weaponize

249
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,640
they're just you know you don't want any

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,649
kind of security vulnerability exploit

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,279
and cause harm to someone so these are

252
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,420
this has become very important areas and

253
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,899
then when you getting these other one

254
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,760
these last two are kind of somewhat

255
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:05,670
combined at times you get the people

256
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,860
aspect your your pen testing people so

257
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,290
through social engineering and buildings

258
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,050
through trying to access the buildings

259
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,910
by cloning cards picking locks or just

260
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,099
you know tailgating those type of things

261
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,329
so these are you know you can have a

262
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,950
very secure network but if your people

263
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:25,319
are not secure your buildings not secure

264
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,760
then it makes it easier for an attacker

265
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,620
to get into your building and access

266
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:35,990
these these assets and types of pen

267
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,640
the target knowledge and so these like a

268
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:45,160
different knowledge that you have on the

269
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:49,730
targets so black box is usually more

270
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,650
indicator of what a malicious actor

271
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,630
would attack this is more like a

272
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,180
real-world attack so you've got limited

273
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,850
information usually maybe just IP

274
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,370
addresses I did a Penta black box pen

275
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,650
test for a company and we just knew the

276
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,720
address physical address to be able to

277
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,660
test the physical security and it was up

278
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,120
to us to find the network blocks through

279
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,250
Poe sent to be able to test that target

280
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,350
and so this is more like a real-world

281
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,000
attacker white box is just opposite a

282
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,130
spectrum you got detailed information

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,890
when it comes to web application pen

284
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,450
testing you've got accounts different

285
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,920
documentation working with the

286
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,839
developers to get a flow of the

287
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,069
application how it works because of

288
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,750
white box testing you want to make sure

289
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,820
you don't miss anything and white box

290
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,760
testing is also referred to as crystal

291
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,089
box and this is very important a web app

292
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,470
because you know if the external

293
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,660
security controls may be really tight

294
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,020
and you can't get in so what happens if

295
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,540
someone is able to bypass that how

296
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,150
secure is the application beyond the

297
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,370
surface so it's important to test on

298
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,220
different levels you want to test that

299
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,600
admin unauthenticated and some of the

300
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,700
lower level users you may have an

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,080
application that has been used in

302
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,339
different regions and you have admins

303
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,420
for those regions so you want to test

304
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:06,350
all those roles because even as an admin

305
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,360
there's like stuff like Social Security

306
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,130
numbers that they don't need to see so

307
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,110
you need to make sure that that

308
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,760
information is not being leaked and then

309
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,990
gray box is more common this is more

310
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,930
common what you're gonna see as a pen

311
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,790
tester you get your IP address ranges

312
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,189
there's more information where you can

313
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,980
do the test and it's these all three

314
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,270
options are really dictated on the

315
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,970
amount of depth that needs to be tested

316
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,790
and the time if you've got a lot of time

317
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,370
then black box could be a good option

318
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,069
and if you very short on time then white

319
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,600
box may be a better solution and just

320
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,060
like I said the white box you can more

321
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,770
thoroughly test the systems but all

322
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,310
three of these methods and extremes are

323
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,310
good to test

324
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,660
and types of types of steps within

325
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,949
vulnerability assessments and

326
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,020
vulnerability testing include

327
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,370
vulnerability scans and so a lot of

328
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,189
companies will have a dedicated team

329
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,110
that all they're doing is vulnerability

330
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,540
scans they're running necess or NEX pose

331
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,160
to look for vulnerabilities and this is

332
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,370
turned over to the different teams to

333
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,870
remediate those vulnerabilities the next

334
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,760
step above that is vulnerability

335
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,070
assessment and these first two options

336
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,780
they're not pen tests a vulnerability

337
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,310
assessment you're taking that further

338
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,230
your good a vulnerability scan and

339
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,199
you're validating those vulnerabilities

340
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,850
to make sure they're not false positives

341
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,160
and aside from that you're also running

342
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,650
other tools like in map to look for open

343
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,660
ports and services other ways the test

344
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,370
but in this year you're doing it's

345
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,199
almost like a pin test but you're not

346
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,990
exploiting the system not hacking into

347
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,550
it so you're looking for vulnerabilities

348
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,830
and validating to make sure they're not

349
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,660
false positives in some companies they

350
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,910
will request this opposed to a pen test

351
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,069
because some people are worried about

352
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,130
the risk maybe their environment is a

353
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,110
hospital and they've got medical devices

354
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,880
connected to their Wi-Fi network and

355
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,650
they're wanting be careful so sometimes

356
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,170
people will go with the vulnerability

357
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,000
assessment instead and pen test is the

358
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,750
next level so this is we've done your

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,010
vulnerability scan port scans validated

360
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,720
any of the vulnerabilities that you

361
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,280
found next you're going to your pen

362
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,780
testing tools your scripts and your

363
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,990
exploits and try to hack into those

364
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,760
systems and like we've mentioned before

365
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,590
you know if this is exploitable then

366
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,180
it's a higher risk vulnerability but

367
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,520
then you get into your adversarial

368
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,130
simulation the red team and adversarial

369
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,110
tests one of the best descriptions I

370
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,510
heard of this was from waterfowl that

371
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,220
ones Dallas hackers association he

372
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,020
refers to red teaming is testing the

373
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,320
blue teams so you're going in and

374
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:38,380
testing the controls the technology the

375
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,850
response to these attacks and so you're

376
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,980
doing more of an attack simulation

377
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,260
whereas a pen test is less of a TAC

378
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,420
simulation people usually know what's

379
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,760
going on with the red team very few

380
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,020
people know usually management maybe but

381
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,630
they're really trying to keep this quiet

382
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,160
just to see the response and after the

383
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,100
the test is done they can go back and

384
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,750
find ways to you know improve the

385
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,819
response from the instant response team

386
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,269
and the blue team on blocking these

387
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:08,108
activities there's different

388
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,100
specializations actually the first one

389
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,629
the generals is really not a

390
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,999
specialization this is kind of where

391
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:15,069
most people start out so if you've got a

392
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,539
network background you're gonna start

393
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,699
out as a generalist if you have an

394
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:19,749
application development background then

395
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:22,539
you're gonna start out with webapp

396
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:25,329
pentesting but the generalist you need

397
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,649
to understand networking Wi-Fi and light

398
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,258
web app because during your test

399
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,329
sometimes the only vulnerable is you

400
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:34,899
maybe you may find earthly web

401
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:39,248
applications there's some applications

402
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:42,129
for managing IT functions or different

403
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:43,660
technologies they have web front-ends so

404
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,249
it's good to be able to know this even

405
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,879
as a generalist and then your

406
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:48,970
application

407
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,899
this covers web app mobile thick client

408
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,089
and cloud and then social engineering

409
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,970
social engineering physical go

410
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,160
hand-in-hand so you're in you're trying

411
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,289
to hack people in buildings as we

412
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,569
mentioned before the transportation some

413
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,009
people specialize in this and I've seen

414
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:08,108
people that work in automotive industry

415
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:11,819
that have gone over from being someone

416
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:14,429
that works on the computer systems to

417
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:18,189
troubleshooting those to moving over to

418
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:22,269
vehicle pen testing and then red teaming

419
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:23,949
and with your adversarial simulation and

420
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,269
sometimes is there's a lot more you get

421
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,189
some of the social engineering and

422
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:32,739
physical that go hand in hand with red

423
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:34,238
see me and for the the part of the

424
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:37,899
presentation most people are here for

425
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:39,369
how do I become a pen tester so you know

426
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,009
you have to have this base knowledge you

427
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,839
need to understand the technology you

428
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:46,869
need to understand networking operating

429
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,659
systems especially Windows Linux and

430
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:53,470
UNIX your enterprise networks are gonna

431
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:56,019
be a mostly Windows but then your your

432
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,549
web is gonna be mostly Linux and so you

433
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,220
need to understand these it assists

434
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:03,339
admin level so if you get a shell to a

435
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,529
system that you've you managed to hack

436
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,209
into if you don't understand the command

437
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:09,128
line and it's gonna slow you down so you

438
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,039
really need to understand that

439
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:14,300
technology understand security

440
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,099
applications and hardware

441
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,389
and these are these important items

442
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,310
because you have to understand the

443
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:24,290
technology before you can secure it

444
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:26,629
before you can hack into it and a way to

445
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,490
gain so once you get that technology

446
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,410
knowledge then you need to learn how to

447
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,530
hack and this was where I was at when I

448
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,880
moved from app sack to pentesting I had

449
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,290
experience with web application

450
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,630
vulnerability scanners Network

451
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,790
vulnerability scanners and some other

452
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,070
tools but I didn't know how to hack so I

453
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,950
had to learn how to hack and that's when

454
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,040
I signed up for the the O SCP course to

455
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,390
learn how to hack systems so you can

456
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,300
gain this knowledge through classes

457
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,240
conferences like this different meetings

458
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,720
and meetups there's a lot of local

459
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,720
Hawass chapters and local Def Con groups

460
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,790
that you can go in and and learn from

461
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,260
other people and sometimes taking these

462
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,460
first steps and conferences and meetups

463
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,290
as a way to see if you're really

464
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,790
interested sometimes you may not want to

465
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,930
invest the money into something unless

466
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,930
you know it's something that you're

467
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,480
wanting to do self-study is a big one

468
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,550
even if you do the classes and stuff you

469
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,770
definitely need to to do some self say

470
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,419
so one of the best options here is home

471
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,190
labs getting the hand on hands-on

472
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,650
experience there's a lot of good videos

473
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,070
on there hacking walkthroughs on YouTube

474
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,990
and different educational videos

475
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,790
tutorials are good there's a lot of good

476
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,190
tutorials on how to use the tools how to

477
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,500
do different hacking techniques blogs

478
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,820
and articles and Twitter the InfoSec

479
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,270
twitter is a great place to find

480
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,860
information prior to Twitter I used to

481
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,260
get my information from blogs and RSS

482
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,030
feeds now through Twitter sometimes you

483
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,270
may find out it's about some new exploit

484
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,470
before it actually makes it to some

485
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,510
magazine articles so you can get your

486
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,900
information quicker and get links to

487
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,700
proof of concept code and connect with a

488
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,610
lot of other security professionals that

489
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,890
you can learn from and also networking

490
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:11,120
and networking is Bigham on finding jobs

491
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,520
as well as gaining knowledge and so the

492
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,409
hacker mindset you can understand the

493
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,180
different hacking tools and how to do

494
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,640
certain hacks but you have to develop

495
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,920
the hacker mindset that's be able to

496
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,990
chain together different exploits and

497
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,200
vulnerabilities be able to exploit those

498
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,100
different vulnerabilities and see how

499
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,169
you can get further you

500
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,020
maybe we'll get passed into the lair but

501
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:35,480
if you can't exploit the system then you

502
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,330
may be stuck there so understanding this

503
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,650
is very important and you develop this

504
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,250
kind like you do troubleshooting by

505
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,720
hands-on experience and if you're doing

506
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,539
you know Network administration or

507
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,549
sysadmin work or development if you when

508
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,190
you're starting out when things install

509
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,960
and go perfect that's great but if you

510
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,490
if things don't go wrong and you miss

511
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,100
out an opportunity to troubleshoot and

512
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,940
hacking similar to troubleshooting you

513
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,730
know it's getting the hands-on

514
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,990
experience and pen testing is one of the

515
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:08,150
areas and security that that is a

516
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,220
combination of creativity and analytical

517
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,049
thinking so you have to be creative and

518
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,690
this is how helps you develop the hacker

519
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,400
mindset and the hacker mindset takes

520
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,950
repetition to develop and it's best

521
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:24,860
develop with hands-on learning

522
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:26,960
we like labs in the formula for becoming

523
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,719
a pen tester is as we discovered you

524
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,990
have to understand the technology the

525
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,059
security of it that target as well as

526
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,710
have the hacker mindset and once you

527
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,360
have all these then you're on your way

528
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,350
to becoming a pen tester having what it

529
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,969
takes and you'll be patient with

530
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,918
yourself while you're learning for me

531
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,440
this wasn't a really easy topic to learn

532
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,169
so give yourself patience take time

533
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,520
while you're doing this you know take

534
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:53,900
time to really understand where you do

535
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,330
it if you don't take the time to

536
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,950
understand it then you there's a good

537
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,699
chance you're going back and having to

538
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,530
relearn it all over again and developing

539
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,080
a plan so we're you kind of do a gap

540
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,850
analysis so you need to fill in the gaps

541
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,070
that you're missing if you're just

542
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,570
getting started out then the basics like

543
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,970
operating systems hardware and

544
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,730
networking web development some kind of

545
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,130
development that's a good background to

546
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,580
get IT experience if you're working in

547
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,140
IT and you'll have Linux experience or

548
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,260
security learn that so learn those items

549
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,980
those Basics in InfoSec experience

550
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,059
there's you may work in some area that

551
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,880
compliance or something missing some of

552
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,889
these areas so go back and fill in these

553
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,870
areas that you're missing the better you

554
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,909
learn something the better pentester

555
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,719
you're going to be less googling and

556
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:42,950
research you have to

557
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
why you're doing a pen test the better

558
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,540
and it's gonna take some of that at

559
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,490
first but as you get into it and learn

560
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,290
certain exploits then you'll kind of

561
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,900
know once you see this circle really hey

562
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,800
I can use this exploit and build on that

563
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:01,870
so participating in pen testing hacking

564
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,100
hacking in CTF sblood bounties and

565
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,770
building a lab are really good ways to

566
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,120
get experience filling these gaps and

567
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,090
for everyone no matter what level you're

568
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,560
at build a lab I even have a lab at home

569
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,439
so if you're wanting to learn some new

570
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,929
hacking techniques even if you're in the

571
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,420
field as a pen tester then sometimes you

572
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,620
wanna test it in a lab environment so to

573
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,830
make sure it's not going to have any

574
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,570
negative impact on the network or the

575
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,250
systems you're testing and this getting

576
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,350
way to test your proof of concepts prior

577
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,140
to using it because sometimes exploits

578
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,770
or you use it once and you can't use it

579
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,200
again because uh you know sometimes it

580
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,550
messes up like a tcp/ip port or a

581
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,620
service and you're not able to run it

582
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:46,909
again so having that lab to test your

583
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,260
proof of concepts is it's a good idea in

584
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,260
your lab setup so there's different

585
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,050
options out there for you and based on

586
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,180
your budget and your time you have to

587
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,570
spend in it these kind of start out with

588
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,030
the most time the least time needed to

589
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,740
setup and troubleshoot - the most time

590
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,810
needed to setup and troubleshooting the

591
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,850
most money so you're minimis lab this is

592
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,580
what I recommend starting out is you

593
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,139
take your your desktop or your laptop

594
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,449
and you install some VMs on it you

595
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,520
install your attack platform I think you

596
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,930
install some vulnerable VMs and your

597
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,629
attack platform can actually be your

598
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,550
host OS as well and then you get in your

599
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,860
dedicated labs this is where you're

600
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,230
starting to have separate systems you

601
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,780
can have like a separate computer that's

602
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,180
working as a server with different VMs

603
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,500
on it different vulnerable VMs and then

604
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,930
you can get more advanced labs where you

605
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,760
got your routers and switches and your

606
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,740
your computers and servers that you're

607
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,629
actually attacking seek but one thing to

608
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,960
keep in mind with this if you're really

609
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,490
in a crunch to try to learn something

610
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,310
the more complex you get you can spend

611
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,470
more time troubleshooting your lab early

612
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,220
in my career I did web web development

613
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,470
or actually

614
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,250
web design on the side I built websites

615
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,340
and

616
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,210
hosted them at home on Linux server that

617
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,610
I had home

618
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,130
and so the problem I'd run in from time

619
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,659
to time is if I had a failed hard drive

620
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,060
then I was troubleshooting trying to fix

621
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,840
issues if I was having problems with the

622
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,490
webserver

623
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,419
I was troubleshooting and fixing your

624
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,950
issues so I have go into using web

625
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,690
hosting companies so I could spend more

626
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,580
time on the part I was making money off

627
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,370
of so keep that in mind you can spend

628
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,330
more time troubleshooting and this is

629
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,639
good too if you're trying to learn

630
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,290
networking but just have to balance your

631
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,240
priorities at the time if you really

632
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,470
need to learn this then you may stick

633
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,480
with more the minimalist lab and

634
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,310
advantage to the minimalist lab but you

635
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,630
can have a combination of these you know

636
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,700
if you've got a laptop with vulnerable

637
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,700
VMs if you're home studying sometimes

638
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,050
you get bored and burn out sometimes to

639
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,930
change your scene or going to a coffee

640
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,399
shop when they open back up and you know

641
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,960
go to the park or somewhere else and

642
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,510
just test if you're traveling for work

643
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,230
or something you can clear out your lab

644
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,540
on the plane while you're traveling so

645
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,610
the mem lists the portability is really

646
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,260
what I like about that option I've kind

647
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,030
of got both of those going on home I get

648
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,120
kind of a dedicated lab in the

649
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,500
minimalist thing going on and then you

650
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,540
have to have your attack platform this

651
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,400
is the operating system that you're

652
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,649
going to use to perform your attacks

653
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,170
with Kali Linux is a popular when

654
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,620
peridot s is a pretty good option as

655
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,020
well

656
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,939
Kali I like it's been around longer it

657
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:24,110
was developed by pen testers for pen

658
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,090
testers they're also the creators of the

659
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,240
OS CP certification so there's a lot of

660
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,980
good experience going behind that and I

661
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,660
feel like you know it's it's a brand

662
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,740
that's gonna be around for a while so

663
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,970
they'll have that they'll keep

664
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,160
supporting that and they keep making

665
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,530
improvements on the operating system

666
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,850
some of the recent changes to the

667
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,680
operating system where you're not

668
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,270
logging in as root makes it a little

669
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,520
more secure so it can actually be used

670
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,690
as a daily driver in the past there will

671
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,670
be something you have to be careful if

672
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,470
you use as your daily driver or do a

673
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,690
little more lockdown on your security to

674
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,030
make sure you know you're not going to

675
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,430
get your attack machine breached and

676
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,350
another option too is Ubuntu you can use

677
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:03,290
the pen tester framework script by

678
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,480
trusted set and it's a that will sit

679
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,480
there and install all these different

680
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,660
pen testing tools there

681
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,340
like in in cali so this is a good option

682
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,060
to if you want to just install them on

683
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,970
ubuntu and another option is have a

684
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,220
Windows 10 VM or operating system and

685
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,320
install the fire I command OBM scripts

686
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,720
this installs all the windows based

687
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,810
hacking tools and sometimes you need a

688
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,640
Windows VM to better attack Active

689
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,860
Directory or some Windows devices so

690
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,310
having those admin tools can be very

691
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:39,399
helpful and kind of for me I always have

692
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,350
like a Windows VM as well as the Kali VM

693
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,070
to test so it's good to have more than

694
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:47,110
one option and you have to have your

695
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,760
targets in your home lab so you can

696
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,699
create virtual machine targets from

697
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,590
using vault up and some really good

698
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,050
choices to start out with is exploitable

699
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,350
to annex Metasploit able to a Metasploit

700
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:02,440
will three and the good thing about

701
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,990
these vulnerable VMs is there's a lot of

702
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,070
vulnerabilities on it to exploit whereas

703
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,320
the gifties same amount of

704
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,689
vulnerabilities on other vm she meant to

705
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,129
install multiple so you can kind of you

706
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,870
can start out with Metis point well to

707
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,970
you and that'll keep you busy for a

708
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,860
while if you get stumped go online look

709
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,390
up some walkthroughs the walkthroughs

710
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,729
can be very educational you can see how

711
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:26,530
different people exploit these same

712
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:28,630
systems a no wast webgoat there's also a

713
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,180
vast array of vulnerable apps that you

714
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,370
can use juice shop is a good one

715
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,100
damn vulnerable web app Mattila day

716
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,679
there's a bunch of them out there for

717
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,629
the for vulnerable web apps and create

718
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,140
your own vulnerable VMs you can download

719
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,760
the software from exploit DB as well as

720
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,290
having exploits they have links to some

721
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,480
of the vulnerable software versions so

722
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,950
if you want to test the exploits out you

723
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,750
can download and build your own

724
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,750
vulnerable VMs with this software and

725
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,080
recommend it reading so you you know

726
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,850
these are some really good books to

727
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,860
start out with the pen testing a

728
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:06,040
hands-on introduction to hacking by

729
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:09,100
Georgia weepin this was my class book

730
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,530
textbook for my ethical hacking class

731
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,480
the first semester first first year

732
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,060
actually and it's a really good book it

733
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,560
teaches you how to build labs and the

734
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,690
only reason I really moved to the pen

735
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,980
test plus content is to give students a

736
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,440
certification

737
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,440
prepare for but this shows you how to

738
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,059
build a lab and also how to do pen

739
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,620
testing so this book is a really good

740
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,600
good one to start out with and this is

741
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,370
what I recommend and start with in the

742
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,980
next book I would get moved to is that

743
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,090
the hackers playbook version two and

744
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,669
three are out but I would start out

745
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:43,510
don't skip over a version version to

746
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:46,299
version two is more pen testing centric

747
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,860
and version three gets into more red

748
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,110
teaming so you're more adversarial

749
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,639
simulation so both of these are good and

750
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,290
they play on each other so I would start

751
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,620
out with the hackers playbook too and

752
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,059
then progress to version three and four

753
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,459
web app pen testing one of the best

754
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,889
books out there is the web application

755
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,410
hacker's handbook discovering exporting

756
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,840
flaws make sure to get version two of

757
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,309
that there's two versions out in version

758
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,780
two is the latest version I use this

759
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,610
from my web application pen testing

760
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,710
class it's a really good book to learn

761
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,059
from and the creators of this or the

762
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,510
creators is actually one of the writers

763
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:22,030
of burp suite which is one of the most

764
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,250
common in popular web application pen

765
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,899
testing tools and then you have the red

766
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,840
Red Team Field Manual this is just a

767
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,790
good reference to have very thin

768
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,990
lightweight easy easy book to carry

769
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,549
around it's got a lot of different

770
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:38,049
syntax for Windows Unix Linux and maps

771
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:40,000
of the different pen testing tools so

772
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,950
it's a really quick reference and

773
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,620
sometimes you're testing a network and

774
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:49,929
you may not have access to the Internet

775
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,889
and so having this book can be handy and

776
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:54,580
here's here's a list of learning

777
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,200
resources and the first the first group

778
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,399
of resources you can kind of see at the

779
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,590
top there's a kind of a gap there these

780
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,360
first ones are not free resources they

781
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,370
go from where most expensive down the

782
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,439
least expensive sans is really good

783
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:11,080
content but not everyone has employers

784
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,510
that can pay seven thousand dollars for

785
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,520
training and then travel if travel is

786
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,470
required for the training it's really

787
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,660
good content it's written by some of the

788
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,460
industry industry bests and a lot of

789
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,070
them work in in consulting the really

790
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,169
sharp lines yeah people like Tim Madine

791
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,730
teaching there that that created

792
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:29,290
Kerberos ting so it's a really good

793
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,030
resource and if your company will pay

794
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,918
for it I recommend taking I've been

795
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,940
through there with about pentesting

796
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,309
course

797
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,340
of their advanced pen testing and

798
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,350
exploit development class the GX pn as

799
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,779
well as i went to a hosted ICS pen

800
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,549
testing course there and they were all

801
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,980
really good very helpful courses and

802
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:50,019
then even at security is another it's

803
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,350
another opportunity to learn this is the

804
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:55,330
this is really good price usually the

805
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,389
max you're gonna pay is about $1,200

806
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:03,090
there's different levels and the levels

807
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:05,769
vary on where you have to do all of your

808
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,860
learning online or some of them you can

809
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:11,590
download PDFs and then the amount of lab

810
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,340
time you get in the labs and it's really

811
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,049
good

812
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,149
there's certifications that go along

813
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:18,820
with it and you have to perform pen

814
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:20,949
tests on the pen testing certs and then

815
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,408
there's also virtual hacking labs which

816
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,940
is this is fairly inexpensive think you

817
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:28,149
can get like a year's worth the lab time

818
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,529
for $750 so if you're going the OSAP

819
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:32,018
route this is a good way to start

820
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:35,379
because they've got like a course with

821
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:39,269
it as well as a virtual lab setup that

822
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:41,379
you connect via VPN like the osep labs

823
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:42,940
but with a difference with this they

824
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,799
have different level boxes and they're

825
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,529
actually listed on their difficulty and

826
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,320
they will give you hints and tips to

827
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:52,360
help exploit that system as you get into

828
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,950
more difficult systems they give you

829
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,689
less help so they're kind of building

830
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,100
you up you're starting up and then they

831
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,259
take your training wheels off at the end

832
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,120
and so it's up to you to be able to hack

833
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,159
into the systems without the help so

834
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,959
it's a good way to to prep you in a good

835
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:09,220
way to prepare for the OSC P and

836
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,009
pentester lab this is a really good one

837
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:15,190
for web application pen testing they

838
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:17,259
take you past the typical looked here's

839
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,090
how you do a pop-up window for

840
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,649
cross-site scripting some of these

841
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,649
actually show you how to get a shell to

842
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:26,350
a system so it goes really deep into the

843
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:27,639
hacking part of web app pen testing and

844
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,000
then there's practical pen test labs

845
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:34,149
this one is like $64 for lifetime access

846
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,230
I think most of the systems are Linux

847
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm not sure if there's a Windows

848
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,139
systems but it's a really good place to

849
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,869
start there's a VPN a set up that you

850
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:46,539
connect to it via VPN and and test that

851
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,830
network and it's 64 dollars for four

852
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,510
years

853
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,510
lifetime access so that's a really good

854
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:55,269
deal and then bugcrowd University and

855
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,740
hacker one these are our bug bounty

856
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:59,019
platforms and they offer some

857
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,620
educational content so these are good

858
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:04,299
areas there for video hacker one 101

859
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,760
through hacker one actually has like a

860
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:08,889
CTF so you go through the CTF learning

861
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,690
so they these bug bounty companies put

862
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,380
out a lot of great content on web app

863
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,549
pen testing and then the sans blog

864
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,230
they've got a lot of cheat sheets on

865
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:19,480
there on how to use in Map Metasploit

866
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:22,059
different pen testing and hacking tools

867
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,860
then there's hacking tutorials org this

868
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,440
was created by the people that created

869
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,658
virtual hacking labs they have tutorials

870
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,580
on in map different vulnerability

871
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:32,409
scanners Metasploit and different tools

872
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,720
so this is a good way to learn those

873
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:36,039
tools while you're learning for this

874
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,480
process so if you don't have experience

875
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,789
with a map then this is a good way to

876
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,880
pick up how to use and map those

877
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:44,559
different tools and then cyber AIT I've

878
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,480
got it listed in the free category there

879
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,450
is some paid content but their pen

880
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,450
testing and advanced pen testing courses

881
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,669
on there are free and actually use the

882
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,799
advanced pen testing videos in my class

883
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:58,809
when I was using George's book because

884
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,710
the the content was written by Georgia

885
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:04,928
Weidman and it mirrors fairly close to

886
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,130
the book if you're going through the

887
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:07,960
book I would go through both of these

888
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,859
because you'll pick up some stuff from

889
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,270
both that you may not get and there's

890
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,009
you know video on how to do this so if

891
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:19,330
you're a visual learner this is a good

892
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:21,280
good resource to add to that and the web

893
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,589
application security Academy from ports

894
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,909
wicker this is kind of an extension of

895
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:28,210
the web application hacker's handbook

896
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,500
instead of updating the book they went

897
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,810
ahead and decided to put learning

898
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,000
content online for free as well as the

899
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:36,310
labs so you go through here and it's

900
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,339
gotten pretty pretty thick I use these

901
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,949
labs in my class and it's gotten where

902
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:45,159
now this takes you from kind of more

903
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,689
entry-level stuff up to very advanced so

904
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,089
this is one as one of those type of

905
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,159
resources that will will last you for a

906
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:54,849
while and as you go through the learning

907
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,280
content the labs are online so you can

908
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:59,619
access the labs and there's no no cost

909
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,510
for that the labs can be used mostly

910
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,760
with with the Community Edition

911
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,550
burp sweet but my understanding there

912
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,460
are some some of the labs that require

913
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,500
the pro version and then a wast org this

914
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,830
is a great site because you get a lot of

915
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,720
testing guide in the OWASP top 10 if

916
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,250
you're giving into webapp pen testing

917
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,890
then this is a real good place to learn

918
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,780
you can go to that site and learn a lot

919
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,299
blowing pretty much mostly what you need

920
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,650
to learn as well as there's a list of

921
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,030
vulnerable apps on there some that you

922
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,330
can download they're vulnerable VMs and

923
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,160
some links to some online apps that are

924
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:36,250
that are hosted up in the cloud so you

925
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,810
can use use that that's really good and

926
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,190
then you have hack the box this is a

927
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,900
really good place to practice your

928
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:45,430
hacking some of the stuff is more kind

929
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:48,550
of CTF oriented but there's a good chart

930
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,310
out there by TJ Noll on how to prepare

931
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:54,100
for the OSC P using boxes that are very

932
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,799
similar to the OSC P labs and then over

933
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,779
the wire CTF offers some online hacking

934
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,859
resources which are really good and I

935
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,420
really recommend this if you're really

936
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:04,600
trying to learn Linux security that's a

937
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,220
good place to start and there's a link

938
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,779
down the bottom to the resources this

939
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,240
would be available online that you can

940
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,320
go to this page with all these resources

941
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,180
so that way if you don't take a

942
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,000
screenshot or download the slides which

943
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,169
you're available you can go to that link

944
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,359
and get that information certifications

945
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,690
and one thing I want to say before I

946
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,680
mention the certification part of this

947
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,990
certifications are good at getting your

948
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,790
foot in the door and they can be very

949
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,368
helpful some people have been successful

950
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,470
without them some people they've been

951
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:37,480
successful with them me personally

952
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,129
they've helped me but even if you do

953
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,080
preserve that pursue any of the

954
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,510
certifications spend the time to learn

955
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,400
the content the worst thing you could do

956
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,869
is go through and learn this go through

957
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,780
one of these and complete the

958
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,520
certification and then not retaining the

959
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,340
material and then you need it later on

960
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,869
you got to go back and relearn it and

961
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,340
also you're doing people that do that

962
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,590
you're doing the certifications in

963
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,990
justice because people will say ok this

964
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,250
person came in had this cert and didn't

965
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,529
know what they're doing so some

966
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,530
entry-level certs

967
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,869
seh from EC counsel is one of the one of

968
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,280
the first and most widely known this one

969
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:15,579
is a good one because it kind of helps

970
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,680
bypass the HR firewall HR is very from

971
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,420
with the certified ethical hacker a lot

972
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,328
of hiring managers they really are

973
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,999
plugged in to the industry recommend

974
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:26,799
this it's also a DoD cert so companies

975
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:28,569
that do government work or if you work

976
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:30,660
for the government this is a highly

977
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:33,069
sought after cert along with the CISSP

978
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,180
for government work and then the pen

979
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:39,069
test plus is a little newer of these

980
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,379
entry-level certs but the thing I really

981
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:43,209
like about the pen test plus is it's

982
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,489
really heavy on methodology it's not

983
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,839
just tool based it doesn't just teach

984
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,880
you how to use the tools it shows you

985
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:51,279
the methodology and how to put things

986
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,259
together during a pen test and this is

987
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:55,599
kind of piak content it really builds on

988
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:56,940
some of the previous CompTIA contents

989
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,890
have you been through like security plus

990
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,180
and some of the other certs you'll you

991
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,769
know you've touched on some of these

992
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,910
topics so it kind of builds on that

993
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,919
that's one of the things I really like

994
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,739
about pen test plus is some of the

995
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,200
CompTIA content and then you get into

996
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:14,200
your intermediate certs some people will

997
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,390
consider will say Oh SCP is an entry

998
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,939
level cert mind you it's entry level to

999
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,589
ethical hacking pen testing so it's not

1000
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,660
like an entry level security

1001
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,239
certification it's not not easy and you

1002
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,549
have the G pen both of these are very

1003
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,239
popular certs when people are looking

1004
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:33,940
for for pen testers they typically will

1005
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:38,019
look for the cheap in osep or the sans

1006
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,459
webapp pen testing cert and osep you

1007
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:41,140
actually have a practical exam where

1008
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:43,269
you're hacking into systems performing a

1009
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,618
pen test and you have to get a certain

1010
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:45,939
amount of points to be able to pass the

1011
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:49,359
exam so this gives you hands-on

1012
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,390
experience and one of my my second pen

1013
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,328
test job I got because I had this cert

1014
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,739
they normally do a hands-on interview

1015
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,049
where they give you a vulnerable VM to

1016
00:38:56,739 --> 00:39:03,009
pen test and since I had that that got

1017
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:07,469
me parsed past the the lab portion of

1018
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:09,880
the interview and the Jeep in this is a

1019
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,589
question/answer typical like the sand

1020
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,900
certs they may bring up like a certain

1021
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:15,369
tool and have you asked answer questions

1022
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,219
towards that and then your advanced

1023
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,809
certifications the gspn advanced pen

1024
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:23,739
testing and exploit development by sands

1025
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:26,109
and OSCE by offensive security these are

1026
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:28,509
advanced pen testing and exploit

1027
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,380
development certs and as far as these go

1028
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:33,370
your

1029
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:36,190
which one to get a lot of companies what

1030
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,440
equally ask for the sand certs as much

1031
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,110
as the offensive security certs my

1032
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,420
recommendation would be what helped me

1033
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,620
the most was the OS CP because I

1034
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,690
actually learned how to hack through

1035
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,980
that so you actually have to prove that

1036
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:53,500
these methods you learned are working

1037
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,060
and some job tips so professional

1038
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,190
networking you know be part of your

1039
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,470
local meetups different clubs and groups

1040
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,790
and go to conferences that way it's a

1041
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,129
good way to network even their knees

1042
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:06,420
virtual conferences get in discord talk

1043
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:09,340
to people network my last three

1044
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,870
permanent full-time jobs even including

1045
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,710
mine my teaching job I got through

1046
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:16,089
referrals people I know meetups Gaming

1047
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,400
referrals to jobs and at the time I

1048
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,080
really wasn't looking for a job so stay

1049
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,270
unplugged in connecting to your

1050
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,590
community is a good way to find jobs and

1051
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,650
I really have to put in a lot of effort

1052
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,750
in seeking out jobs and then LinkedIn is

1053
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,360
good and that's your virtual resume make

1054
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:34,690
sure you have that populated keep it

1055
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,950
professional and make sure you update it

1056
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,540
regularly when you learn things make

1057
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,970
sure it's on there so recruiters will

1058
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,090
find you so most the recruiters I hear

1059
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,890
from or directly through LinkedIn if not

1060
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,410
through referrals and interview tips

1061
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,330
prepare for the interviews know the hola

1062
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,549
spot can no matter what kind of pentest

1063
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:55,360
job you're applying for you're always

1064
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:57,070
gonna get asked some interview question

1065
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,450
about the last option cross-site

1066
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,780
scripting the different types how to

1067
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,549
remediate sequel injection so you can

1068
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,770
ask letters and then some of the basic

1069
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,910
stuff when you're interviewing for upper

1070
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,020
level management they've been away from

1071
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,779
it for a while they may ask you

1072
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,240
questions about freeway TC PCP handshake

1073
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,770
and the OSI model so kind understand

1074
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,720
those and anything you put your resume

1075
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,060
or LinkedIn make sure it's stuff you've

1076
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,589
done if you know you have a working

1077
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,049
knowledge of it because when you write

1078
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,450
your resume you're basically giving the

1079
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,250
interviewer an outline of what questions

1080
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,560
to ask you so you have something you

1081
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,810
really don't know that well you could

1082
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,700
get asked questions on it so keep that

1083
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:37,570
in mind and if you don't know it don't

1084
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,299
put it on your resume and here's my

1085
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:43,030
contact information how I got into

1086
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,860
teaching was through just men

1087
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,590
and helping people that were interested

1088
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,660
in getting into pen testing and so

1089
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,060
here's my contact information I'm pretty

1090
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,640
responsive and happy to help people out

1091
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,590
I've helped a lot of people get started

1092
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,390
my website is the hacker maker comm I

1093
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,300
usually post information on my upcoming

1094
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,339
classes at Richland College and I run

1095
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,070
the pone school project so we livestream

1096
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,600
our meetings and there's recording

1097
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,230
content on there as well as a link to

1098
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,470

podcast the uncommon journey on ITP sb

1100
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:21,220
itsp magazine it's available on other

1101

platforms but check those out and that

1102
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,720
concludes my presentation if anyone has

1103
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:33,069
any questions I'd be happy to take those

1104
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:34,810
now all right yeah we've got I know

1105
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,460
we've got at least one here and you

1106
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,710
might have answered it this question

1107
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,630
came in pretty early during the talk and

1108
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,000
I know you touched on certifications

1109
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,100
later but the question is what are your

1110
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,520
thoughts on cyber security master's

1111
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,750
programs you know any point in going

1112
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,810
that route or just stick with

1113
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,160
certifications for me it's it's you're

1114
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,240
really gonna Bend depend on your end

1115
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,779
goal if you're want to move into

1116
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,060
management I've seen companies that will

1117
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,310
only put people management some of these

1118
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:05,799
are like some you're big for consulting

1119
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:07,330
companies and even some of them as far

1120
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,590
as used to require bachelor's degrees

1121
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,150
aren't requiring it but I would say if

1122
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,650
you're just getting started out you've

1123
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,720
got the time to spin in school it's not

1124
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,940
gonna hurt you to have it

1125
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,529
but definitely if you want to be a pen

1126
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,820
tester you don't have to have a master's

1127
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,190
degree if that's something you want to

1128
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,780
get I would get it it's definitely not

1129
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,220
going to hurt you at all and if you ever

1130
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,920
decide you want to teach it's good to

1131
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,779
have so any kind of formal education

1132
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,220
sometimes what this is gonna do if you

1133
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,160
go to school get a computer science

1134
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,470
degree or a cyber security degree this

1135
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,089
is going to give you some base knowledge

1136
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,980
coming in because if you don't have that

1137
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,890
you're not working in IT you're still

1138
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:46,690
gonna have to learn you know learn

1139
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:49,000
technology to be a pen tester another

1140
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,369
ideas on certifications training

1141
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,230
programs etc that are focused on the red

1142
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,060
team side of things including social

1143
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,000
engineering physical security testing

1144
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:01,270
and adversarial emulation I think you

1145
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,470
touched on a lot of those but go ahead

1146
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:08,200
some of the classes pentester academy

1147
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,950
has like a course on and their their red

1148
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,990
team courses are really focused around a

1149
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,490
active directory it kind of slipped my

1150
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,970
mind

1151
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:20,470
rastamouse there through zero security

1152
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,109
has some kind of course that goes

1153
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,930
through I think they leverage the pro

1154
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:28,990
version of ethical hack packed the box

1155
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,669
so that's a really popular one zero

1156
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:34,720
security actually has a cert board and

1157
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:37,119
that's based on you know the logical

1158
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,790
side not really the technical side not

1159
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,950
so much the physical or social

1160
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:44,609
engineering part of red teaming there's

1161
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:46,569
some people after that offers some some

1162
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:49,869
courses like that a lot of that it's

1163
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:53,109
gonna be probably easier found at like

1164
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:55,089
blackhat I know also Jason Street does

1165
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:58,839
some social engineering courses from

1166
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:02,410
time to time someone recently shared one

1167
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:04,270
with me it was like Red Team Academy or

1168
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,399
something around that lines and they go

1169
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:09,660
into a lot of physical and lock-picking

1170
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,369
and stuff sans used to offer like a

1171
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,848
hosted one or two day class that was on

1172
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:18,250
like physical security so so they're out

1173
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:21,040
out there but it's not as real already

1174
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:24,640
available as some of the the hacking

1175
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,589
pieces and red teaming there's a lot of

1176
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,900
good stories out there too I know a

1177
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:31,390
speaker we had earlier Adam Compton has

1178
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,960
a whole podcast series that he's done on

1179
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:36,670
YouTube on pentest fails you know and

1180
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,619
they're just so many stories on how I

1181
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,670
went to jail or almost went to jail

1182
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:45,099
Jason Street that a dark dark net

1183
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:52,119
Diaries you know about how we robbed the

1184
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:55,960
wrong bank and I mean it's it's I've got

1185
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,730
some myself but I find those are those

1186
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,640
are can actually be pretty useful and

1187
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,140
like like stuffed some red team

1188
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,328
situations you can get into trouble so

1189
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:10,269
those are holding that on the osep right

1190
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:12,130
yeah yes uh that's one of the things too

1191
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:13,359
is go through any of these things

1192
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:16,599
learning how to hack you need to learn

1193
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,339
the methodology too so you know don't

1194
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:21,039
just get hung up on the hacking part and

1195
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:23,650
learn the methodology because I've seen

1196
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:26,079
people that came in that the one thing

1197
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,970
got their osep they knew how to hack all

1198
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,440
day long but they come back and told me

1199
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:34,930
man there's a lot more to pen testing

1200
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:37,510
than I thought so wrestling the bear did

1201
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:39,430
you win well technically I have to say

1202
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,349
no the bear didn't take me down but I

1203
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,669
didn't take the bear down either and so

1204
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:45,549
yeah that was actually wrestled that

1205
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,260
bear twice and it was back during my pro

1206
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:49,420
wrestling days I worked part time as a

1207
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,369
bouncer because I wasn't making enough

1208
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,680
pro wrestling getting started out so

1209
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:55,210
they did a promo on a Sunday because

1210
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,460
they were bringing in this bear to bring

1211
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,049
in you know extra business on Sundays

1212
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,000
because Sunday's would normally slow so

1213
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,759
it was interesting experience not in B

1214
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,289
team but it was pretty crazy how hard it

1215
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
was to move that bear is like trying to

1216
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:11,500
to move a parked car

1217
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,118
so we we all agreed in the chat on

1218
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,450
discord that you won because you

1219
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,640
survived it yeah so so based on that

1220
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:22,569
alone the fact that you know he had what

1221
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:28,960
a 4-4 400 450 pound advantage over you

1222
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:34,750
you win by surviving with both eyes not

1223
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:37,240
disfigured yeah well awesome I don't

1224
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,700
think we have any other questions but

1225
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,500
this was great lots of questions about

1226
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,569
you know certainly if you can get these

1227
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,880
or if you've already got the slides up

1228
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:48,269
where people can get to them I've gotta

1229
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,339
give resources in there yep there are

1230
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:52,118
re-upload ask it last night awesome

1231
