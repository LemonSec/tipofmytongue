1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:08,329
all right well yet without further ado

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:12,629
Joe gray social engineering your metrics

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,490
very cool I think under represented one

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,920
I remember telling Joe and I was looking

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,600
at an early version of this I've seen a

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,580
lot of metric talks and a lot of them

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,170
just don't get into enough detail enough

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,250
examples and stuff like that so it's

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,380
good to have one of these and metrics in

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,150
general is just one of those things that

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,399
doesn't sound very sexy to talk about

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,390
but you get in a situation where you

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,719
need them and and boy is it important so

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,329
I'll leave it to you Joe

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:49,050
take it away thank you very much

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:53,430
Adrian so um here's me my office

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,800
so I'm Joe gray you all didn't take time

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,879
out of your day to look at my ugly face

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,260
so we're gonna go ahead and get into the

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:06,090
slides so welcome to social engineering

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,600
your metrics basically this is kind of a

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,659
derivative of one of the chapters of my

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,658
upcoming book when I was ready the

24
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:18,869
defensive portion of the book talking

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,710
about ways to integrate with Incident

26
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:26,310
Response to find ways to have better

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,520
awareness programs I was brainstorming

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,900
and it came to me you know we should

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,399
talk about some metrics and I didn't

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,049
want to reinvent the wheel but at the

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,229
same time I wanted to provide something

32
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,880
that would kind of disrupt things and

33
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,929
actually have it change for the good

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,030
so about me by day I'm a senior ascent

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,729
specialist at complex I served in the

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,189
Navy on submarines not gonna read

37
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,310
everything on this of course generalist

38
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,750
promotion for the book it's due out

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,000
October 13th it is available for

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,110
pre-order on Amazon that is a redirect

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,659
link that will take you there

42
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,100
I used to write for Forbes now I write

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,930
for whomever I feel like it right now

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,369
the competitive side of me from ascent

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,920
and social engineering kind of where I

46
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,970
got my basis from I'm the 2017 Derby

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,339
social engineering capture-the-flag

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,489
winner the runner-up of the 2019

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,160
hackfest in Quebec City social

50
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,630
engineering capture the flag I can't

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,810
stress how important the phrase Polly

52
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,849
vous Anglais was that day and then I've

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,340
competed in quite a few ascents ETFs and

54
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,049
missing persons CTFs notably getting

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,690
fourth place at the derby condo since

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,690
ETF last year fifth place in the most

57
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,150
recent tres labs missing persons CTF and

58
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,160
second place in the tres labs missing

59
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,360
persons CTF at hackfest the same one I

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,010
was competing in the social engineering

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,840
stuff with I'm not a lawyer but here's

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,970
the disclaimer so the thoughts and

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,069
opinions are mine mine alone not those

64
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:01,019
of any of my employers past present or

65
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:04,170
future so to break into this and get in

66
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,000
line with the objectives I want to talk

67
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,458
about current general metrics and social

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,620
engineering specific metrics the problem

69
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,720
with that I'm going to introduce some

70
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,519
new metrics a little bit about analysis

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,790
models and some potential for future

72
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,070
integration so with that being said

73
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,000
current InfoSec metrics that we have in

74
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,608
general we have metrics about passwords

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,049
things like these are the most common

76
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:35,130
passwords these here's the common time

77
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:37,160
to crack this list of passwords here's

78
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,070
the complexity of such-and-such password

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,859
on average X percentage of people within

80
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,019
an organization have their email address

81
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,780
password phone number or something in a

82
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,880
data breach and then what getting into

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,000
the vendor world we have response

84
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,410
metrics so that comes into things like

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,180
service level agreements between

86
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,260
organizations and manage security

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,819
providers but then it also gets into

88
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:08,399
other other terms of responses such as

89
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,810
internal things that could be used in

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,220
performance evaluations and

91
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,260
what-have-you

92
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,819
then we have what I call the vendors

93
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,608
favorite metric and that's dwell time

94
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,579
especially when we're talking about

95
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,930
vendor selling malware protection or

96
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,000
something along those lines so dwell

97
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,800
time basically the time from compromise

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
until they actually decide to do

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,830
something

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,170
and while it's not specifically a metric

101
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,340
per se return-on-investment

102
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:40,120
is a pretty common theme that is metric

103
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,580
ish or metric adjacent if you will so

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,850
going into social engineering especially

105
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,530
like fishing we have opens clicks

106
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,610
credentials stolen and then we might

107
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,159
have averages or a ratio of opens clicks

108
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,720
stolen credentials so how many people

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,460
open the email how many people clicked

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,700
on the email how many people input stuff

111
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,060
on a form you can convert this over to

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,590
vishen by how many people kept you on a

113
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,980
call for a certain amount of time how

114
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,229
much time was the average phone call

115
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,730
based on the predefined things you were

116
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,100
trying to collect how many of those did

117
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,650
you collect on average and then

118
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,560
regarding ratios it could be the number

119
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,710
of opens as opposed to the number of

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,480
people of ascent to the number of opens

121
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,150
in contrast to how many people clicked

122
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,920
on it or how many people opened it and

123
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,219
you stole creds from a lot of different

124
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,720
ways you can go about that but I mean

125
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,940
getting into the meat and potatoes of it

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,760
we have to ask what's the problem with

127
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,620
this and I'll just summarize this on a

128
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,969
single slide and that's these metrics

129
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,870
really don't measure much basically

130
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,120
they're just measuring something so that

131
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,330
we can say we did better on this metric

132
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,240
that has no application than we did the

133
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,830
last time so we must be doing better

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,770
that's one of those things that I like

135
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,900
to call digital melatonin it's one of

136
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,120
those things that helps execs sleep at

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,130
night and I mean there's nothing wrong

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
with some level of digital melatonin but

139
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,450
at the same time we don't want to get

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,040
too wrapped up on in that if I'm if I'm

141
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,750
providing someone metrics I want to

142
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,300
provide them something that is

143
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,530
actionable something that they can work

144
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,480
with I really I hate using the smart

145
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,780
acronym but specific measurable

146
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,730
attainable realistic and timely that's

147
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,830
that's something I would look for in a

148
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,570
metric so the logic behind that

149
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,340
statement that they really don't measure

150
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,969
much let's face it

151
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,810
emails are meant to be open and we have

152
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,000
a lot of

153
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,360
trading platforms and they really have

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,070
anything for like link detonation you

155
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,810
might be able to input your own links in

156
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,300
there but it's not really going to test

157
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,919
anything and the links are usually

158
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:59,980
really strange and then you know a lot

159
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,830
of non tech folks there they use the

160
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,800
same password everywhere or they may use

161
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,180
some variant of that for free for

162
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,940
example a friend of mine reached out

163
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,190
they had received one of those emails

164
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,560
claiming that it had turned their webcam

165
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,540
on and observed them doing explicit

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,250
stuff and they were gonna release the

167
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,729
video unless they paid him $200 in

168
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:26,590
Bitcoin the password they cited had not

169
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:28,750
been used in about five years the wind

170
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,359
of a cited in the email but it was

171
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,540
literally the person's child's name and

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,910
the year that they were born so that's a

173
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,090
very common thing and it ended up being

174
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,010
an eight character password so in some

175
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,169
compliance schemes that's fully

176
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,849
compliant even though it was all

177
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,810
lowercase and just numbers two of the

178
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:52,539
four typefaces

179
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:53,860
the point with that being that what if

180
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,020
someone required a nine character

181
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,120
password well that person probably would

182
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,320
have added an exclamation point to it or

183
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,900
something to that effect but let's let's

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,300
dig into these bullets again so

185
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,638
regarding emails and the the fact

186
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,500
they're meant to be open a good fish

187
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,030
should not set off any alarms with the

188
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,500
subject line or the sender of the email

189
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,690
the text of a well-constructed fish

190
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,270
should raise some eyebrows but not

191
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,500
immediately set off alarms and that's

192
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,060
assuming you're using something like

193
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Outlook that has a preview pane and then

194
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,190
the other thing is the the training

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,870
platforms a lot of that stuff is

196
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,940
predicated on the assumption that the

197
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,570
organization's going to have a training

198
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,719
program that actually employees that has

199
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,630
something that actually engage the users

200
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,970
and they actually care about oftentimes

201
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,410
it's like oh gosh Security's in my inbox

202
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,780
again I've got to do this stupid

203
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,640
training I'm gonna have to work extra

204
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,920
today to finish my

205
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,900
to find workload because I've got this

206
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,729
deadline or something and I mean

207
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,130
conventional wisdom says oh if it's HTTP

208
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,350
it's safe if it has a green padlock it's

209
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,170
safe that's not the case anymore

210
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,360
and then of course we have human nature

211
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,969
that deals with various types of

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,390
curiosity no matter what you do no

213
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,740
matter how you train people there's

214
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,449
always going to be someone that's going

215
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,060
to either fall for it

216
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,860
because they're naive or they are gonna

217
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,640
fall for it because they're curious or

218
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,890
because they don't care so and if you

219
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,390
want any evidence regarding things about

220
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,390
non tech people using the same password

221
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,199
or variants you can't get that from have

222
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,090
I been pwned

223
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,070
but what you can find out from have I

224
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,470
been poned would be a bunch of the data

225
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,280
breaches that particular email address

226
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:54,090
has been in there are other resources

227
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:57,400
like D hashed or Scylla Scylla is not

228
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,810
commercially online right now so you

229
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,500
have to know somebody to get into that

230
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,209
but basically you could query an email

231
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,590
address in one of those platforms and

232
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,560
there there are others out there there

233
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,630
used to be one called the leak source

234
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,670
but every time I knew when a new leak

235
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,130
source pops up the feds shut it down in

236
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,199
a relative short amount of time but

237
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:22,900
anyway you can query an email address

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:27,160
and see that variation so what am I

239
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:31,959
getting at well I mean what let's let's

240
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,949
deconstruct how these things that we

241
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:40,510
care about affect us so if we care about

242
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,400
opens what we're telling users is that

243
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,020
we are going to punish them for opening

244
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,390
emails and if we've got someone who's

245
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,870
naive or we've got someone who's

246
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,699
problematic maybe not very productive or

247
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,830
something to that effect they may use

248
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,690
that to avoid work oh I'm sorry that

249
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,930
email look like a fish so I didn't I

250
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:05,080
didn't open it or if you have an email

251
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,880
address that you ask your users to send

252
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,460
emails to you may get flood

253
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,950
with legitimate emails and in the

254
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,810
initial learning phases that time but

255
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,690
when you when you've got an employee

256
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,270
who's been with your organization for

257
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,090
months or years who has been in the

258
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,960
training program for weeks months or

259
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:30,440
years that are still sending emails that

260
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,690
they know to be authentic as phishing

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,140
emails then obviously there's a problem

262
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,090
there and opens yes I understand in some

263
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,880
cases there are some types of malware

264
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,880
that when you open it it will execute I

265
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,550
understand that and I'll address that in

266
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,870
a moment but Oh caring about how many

267
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,719
people open an email that doesn't

268
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,720
accurately measure risk it measures some

269
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,700
level of risk but I've got more on that

270
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,760
a little bit later so worrying about

271
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,480
clicks I will admit that clicks are more

272
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,540
relevant than opens uh it does test the

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,860
human but at the same time this is the

274
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,130
point I was getting it from the previous

275
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,810
slide building defense-in-depth should

276
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:16,850
be built in such a way that it allows

277
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,910
for users to make a mistake without

278
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,000
causing a fatal error for your entire

279
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,490
organization if if your security

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,730
architecture is built in such a way that

281
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,530
one single user clicking on one single

282
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,780
fish that has one single piece of

283
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,020
malware can take the entire organization

284
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:40,850
down completely you need to rethink your

285
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:42,439
security priorities that being said if

286
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,930
you have the defense in depth and you

287
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,510
have mitigating factors because at the

288
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,910
end of the day I like to reference wink

289
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,730
or toes book time-based security and

290
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,439
basically that the TLDR of that book is

291
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,440
that we don't need to build security

292
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,060
that's 100 percent absolute we don't

293
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,160
want to build things that's going to

294
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,209
protect us for everyone because as we

295
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,560
saw in Alyssa's presentation before this

296
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,970
it's a constant moving target it's a

297
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,630
continuous game of cat and mouse

298
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,540
so that being said we need to build our

299
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,410
security defenses up in such a way that

300
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,050
they will defend long enough for us to

301
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,939
detect that something is wrong and take

302
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,280
from

303
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,160
steps and actions to mitigate the

304
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,740
problem and the same should exist for

305
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,790
clicking on on links there should be

306
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,190
anytime that you're doing things like

307
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,010
this and you're running with malware or

308
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,500
malware simulation or something to this

309
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,290
effect there should be a test of your

310
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,950
technical controls in addition to the

311
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:51,500
people and honestly a lot of managers

312
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,320
miss that point a lot of people get

313
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,190
really passionate about pointing the

314
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,180
finger at users calling them stupid

315
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,400
punishing them with more training and

316
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,079
don't get me wrong if a user falls

317
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,510
victim yes they need to be retrained

318
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:12,110
they need some sort of remediation but

319
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,540
humiliation and hardcore punitive

320
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,670
actions threatening their job or their

321
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,120
livelihood that's not the way to go

322
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,520
about it

323
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,700
and that falls under the theory of bees

324
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,430
with honey instead of vinegar so looking

325
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:30,350
at stolen credentials you know this is

326
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:32,329
also this fails to face the reality that

327
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,520
is predicated on not on having a

328
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,920
password policy and what I mean by that

329
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,630
is if you're requiring people to change

330
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,490
their passwords depending on which

331
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,770
compliance framework you're in or

332
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,100
whatever your defined interval is based

333
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:49,310
on your organization it could be 30 60

334
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,780
90 180 days could be 365 days you may

335
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,489
not ever have to change the password

336
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:57,140
policy but what I'm getting at with that

337
00:14:52,490 --> 00:15:02,360
is okay if my password was NIC 1999

338
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:06,100
that's only good for up to 89 days if

339
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,540
all passwords are changed every 90 days

340
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,360
but because password reuse is so

341
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:16,969
prevalent then that causes issues

342
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:19,700
because even if I captured NIC 1999 your

343
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,320
next password might be NIC 1999

344
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,810
exclamation point and then the next one

345
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,210
might be with the @ symbol and and there

346
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,069
are ways to go about this and that's why

347
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,790
I really try to hammer home with that

348
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,560
final bullet

349
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,780
it's mitigated with things like

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,869
multi-factor authentication and password

351
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,339
managers of course someone

352
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,250
to know the password Twitter password

353
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,460
manager they have to have access to

354
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,140
whatever method of alabang communication

355
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,440
you are using for multi-factor

356
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,420
authentication but the thing about it is

357
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,029
if you're using a password manager it's

358
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,860
a lot easier to advocate to the users to

359
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,700
use a unique password for every single

360
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,700
website because it's absolutely

361
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,490
transparent to them they don't care I

362
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,920
mean so what if you enforce a password

363
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,450
change every 30 days even if you wanted

364
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,640
to go that far I think that's a little

365
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,490
extreme but if you wanted to go that far

366
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,360
so what it's literally been going into a

367
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,350
forum clicking a button in their browser

368
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,330
updating their database and going on

369
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,740
about their day and then if they have

370
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,900
their password manager on their phone it

371
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,320
seems there too so it's not the end of

372
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,670
the world so with that being said you

373
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,140
can care a lot less about stolen

374
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,020
credentials with the use of password

375
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,170
managers assuming and this is based on a

376
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,290
large assumption that users are creating

377
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,870
and using unique passwords that are

378
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:41,939
complex for every single resource that

379
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:44,620
they use so the TLDR of that is

380
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,750
organizations do try to put the burden

381
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,839
entirely on non-technical employees I

382
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,600
don't expect Betty in HR to be a

383
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,250
security guru just as she should not

384
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,810
expect me to know the laws around

385
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,140
working in human resources in the state

386
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,708
of Tennessee I don't have an MBA because

387
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm no good at accounting so therefore

388
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:10,350
Melissa in accounting cannot expect me

389
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,569
to do her job nor should I expect her to

390
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:16,389
understand everything about security but

391
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,490
just as I have to adhere to the

392
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,260
processes that we use to submit our

393
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,120
expenses and things for repayment and I

394
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,030
have to have that limited working

395
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,159
knowledge of the accounting process

396
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,410
Melissa should also have that limited

397
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
working knowledge of my discipline of

398
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,770
security to understand hey you know this

399
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,390
looks a little fishy I have some

400
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,190
questions about this who do I reach out

401
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:44,500
to and then of course some managers

402
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,660
executives and professionals within is

403
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,820
within the industry they fail to see

404
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,159
that technology is

405
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,840
Dalby all solution it can help mitigate

406
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,110
the problem but it's not going to

407
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,610
completely solve the problem as long as

408
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,168
you don't care about availability the

409
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,019
only way to solve the problem was to

410
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,779
completely disconnect all power sources

411
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:07,269
but then why are we doing this and with

412
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,529
with companies they they fail to admit

413
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:10,779
their own shortcomings they're like well

414
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:13,539
you know we paid for this random

415
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:16,120
training that was made six years ago

416
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:21,250
that still doesn't address all these

417
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,289
other things well that you can't a Betty

418
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,120
and HR can't make that happen that's

419
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,370
going that's got to be a decision from

420
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,279
the top and a lot of not saying all but

421
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,779
a lot of organizations fail to pick up

422
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:37,179
on that and get meaningful use of it I

423
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,799
mean one of the one of the hardest

424
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,649
things about being a consultant back

425
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,149
when I was in consulting was basically

426
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:45,428
telling companies that their baby was

427
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:47,739
ugly and what I remember I got was you

428
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,149
think your security posture is great

429
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,200
well you didn't think about all of these

430
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,268
things and here are some additional

431
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,470
things to think about I mean I didn't

432
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,629
legitimately go and show people with

433
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,120
their babies were ugly but proverbially

434
00:18:55,629 --> 00:19:00,639
speaking yeah so getting into the

435
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,428
metrics that matter so we've got open to

436
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:05,979
click ratio that's that's kind of one

437
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:08,799
that we've looked at before as a

438
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,860
traditional metric but it actually has

439
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,889
some some teeth to it open to action

440
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,049
that accident could be forwarding that

441
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:19,918
could be inputting data that could be

442
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,629
downloading a file with a macro in it

443
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,000
that could be responding whatever the

444
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:29,019
action is you can define that for each

445
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,399
individual part of the engagement the

446
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:33,850
third one is the one that is the most

447
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:38,258
important in my opinion I don't care as

448
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:40,928
a security practitioner I don't care if

449
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:44,649
someone within my organization clicks an

450
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:46,029
email and the email has an exploit kit

451
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:49,178
that's trying to drop ransomware on my

452
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:52,360
network I care that the exploit gets

453
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,340
there what I care most about is that the

454
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,649
employee reports it to me so I have

455
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,350
ample time to take action there's

456
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:02,590
nothing else create a rule within the

457
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,870
routing equipment that would

458
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,428
vent that host from communicating with

459
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,989
any other her so basically putting it in

460
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,909
a rubber room disconnecting power

461
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,590
removing it from the network restoring

462
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,320
from a known good media all those things

463
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,970
that we always hear about but if it's

464
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,330
not reported to me I don't get that head

465
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,830
start

466
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:25,149
I have no opportunity to take action and

467
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:27,428
then the same things for reporting so or

468
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,559
I'm sorry for clicking so click to

469
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,390
action so how long from the time you

470
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,539
click an email until you input something

471
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,700
in the form from the time someone clicks

472
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,940
an email how what is the time between

473
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,830
their first click of an email and the

474
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,309
time it is reported and then you can

475
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,668
even go and say on a per user basis what

476
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:50,470
is the average time between the time

477
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:53,200
someone clicks on an email and reports

478
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,470
it and then oh man I didn't mean to do

479
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,990
that

480
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,090
I totally input information on this form

481
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,860
that I shouldn't have I need to report

482
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:08,949
it that's a very valuable metric as well

483
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:13,570
and then we duplicated that slide so the

484
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,029
click metrics again click to action we

485
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,970
went through that the click to reporting

486
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:21,010
at the end of the day I want to know hey

487
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,210
you know I did something wrong ok cool

488
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,379
you did the right thing

489
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,330
you're gonna you're gonna have to do

490
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,659
some extra training but all is good in

491
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,418
the world

492
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:32,740
trigger incident response do whatever we

493
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:34,210
need to do so the here's the other one

494
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,179
that's very important these are the

495
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,440
distance measures and I got ahead of

496
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:41,890
myself and kind of talked about them

497
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,169
before but open to action that is the

498
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,480
time and I'm working on a script right

499
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,340
now they're will automate this it's not

500
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,080
done I can't show you anything because

501
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:55,750
it's that it's not even close yet but

502
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,658
basically measuring the difference in

503
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:02,610
time using epoch time so measuring the

504
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:05,470
time in seconds from the time a user

505
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,620
opens an email until they perform an

506
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,620
action

507
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,540
with click and again we can do that on a

508
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,640
per user basis or as an organization as

509
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,520
a whole the time from the first click

510
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,050
until their report something to that

511
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,490
effect and then the same thing for we

512
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,409
have it for the actions we have it for

513
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,880
reporting and then the action to report

514
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,150
what is the distance within that time

515
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,110
you know how many people going back to

516
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:38,820
the ratio measurement with action to

517
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:40,740
reporting we had 12 people I'm sorry we

518
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,200
had 10 people click on it but only one

519
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,180
reported so we would in that case we

520
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,210
would say we have a 10 percent reporting

521
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:54,330
ratio very simple math with that and I

522
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,620
try to keep the math as simple as

523
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,629
possible with us we're not going to be

524
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,669
looking at equations don't worry we're

525
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,200
not gonna have any anything from any of

526
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,670
those movies but the the distance

527
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,460
measurement basically you know we

528
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:08,490
ultimately do want to avoid an incident

529
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,080
altogether but we also want to be

530
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:16,140
notified you know i we don't want to be

531
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,960
notified by Brian Krebs the FBI or you

532
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,340
know whatever else there's a reference

533
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,310
to a winch for toes book again focus on

534
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,320
the defenses and then how much how much

535
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,850
lead time do you have to enact incident

536
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,800
responds that's that's really the

537
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:41,340
absolute meat and potatoes of what I'm

538
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:43,560
going for with this so from that lens

539
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,310
I alluded to this before but what if you

540
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:52,200
what if you are a consultant well I mean

541
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,780
you can provide even more value I mean

542
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,030
how do you think organizations like

543
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,649
Symantec and Verizon come up with and

544
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,950
and the anti fish workgroup come up with

545
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,110
things like the is tr the DB IR and the

546
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,880
fishing report of the year well that's

547
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,850
because they have member organizations

548
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,740
that collect metrics and submit them but

549
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,600
if you if you work as a consultant and

550
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,460
you have several clients you can do this

551
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,429
on a per engagement basis and a

552
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,290
population basis the population basis is

553
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,500
going to be all clients the per

554
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:28,129
engagement can be curve facing the

555
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:30,930
engagement or per client so nevertheless

556
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,320
so the sliced metric that would be all

557
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:37,050
fishing again engagements across all

558
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,370
clients client only of course you're

559
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,080
gonna have to anonymize some data you

560
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:44,189
don't want to release anything about an

561
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,810
organization but the ratios themselves

562
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,030
you can say on aggregate Mott our

563
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:53,669
customers tend to have a 42 percent

564
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:59,430
reporting rate as it relates to clicks

565
00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:03,380
they have a 19 percent reporting rate

566
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:07,110
for email opens and a 63 percent

567
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:10,860
reporting rate for having input

568
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,719
information into forms so that's

569
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,899
something you can you can provide and

570
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,850
say okay based on this information your

571
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,280
team is really good at reporting after

572
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,800
they've done something wrong their

573
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,670
marginal at reporting something after

574
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,850
they've clicked on it and they've

575
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:30,210
realized it's bad they're not doing so

576
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:34,889
good at identifying these emails as they

577
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:37,920
open them so with that one being the

578
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:40,830
subject line there's not a whole lot you

579
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,100
can do with that but you can

580
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,620
there are ways you can go about things

581
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:50,159
things like Proofpoint for example that

582
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,850
will prepend or upend the word external

583
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,260
or whatever you choose before or after

584
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,139
the subject of an email

585
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,240
that's always an option as well but

586
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,059
anyway you have access to this data and

587
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,519
of course you would have to look at your

588
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:08,250
your consulting contracts with clients

589
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,960
and verify the verbage with that but if

590
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:15,980
you're using an autumn eyes data then

591
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:19,470
you can say hey here's some value we did

592
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,950
319 fishing engagements last year here

593
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,899
are the statistics you can provide it to

594
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,570
the client exclusively for client only

595
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:30,570
across all of our fishing engagements

596
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,200
here's what we have and then you want to

597
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,178
include fishing here's those as well so

598
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,130
and as we get into that we're gonna deal

599
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,590
with a little bit of the statistic

600
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,029
analysis and this is probably the part

601
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,279
that's going to make some eyes glaze

602
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:46,169
over I'm not gonna get too deep into it

603
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:50,010
but basically we have the mean which is

604
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:53,070
the average that's basically the central

605
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,620
tendency and the equation for that is

606
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,809
there are some basically every value

607
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,570
added together divided by the number of

608
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,730
values we have the median that's going

609
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,299
to be the center most value in your data

610
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,320
set and then we have standard deviation

611
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,220
and that's the amount of variance

612
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,689
between data points within the data set

613
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,610
regarding that a very high standard

614
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,820
deviation is going to show a lot of

615
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,549
variation between your data points lower

616
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,210
standard deviation will indicate that

617
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:25,500
they're grouped very similar and

618
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,389
whenever you're assessing what is high

619
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,559
and what is low that's going to be based

620
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:33,240
on what values your data has so with

621
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,240
that being said when you're dealing with

622
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,429
the statistic methods depending on how

623
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,870
many data points you have like for

624
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:41,159
example if you're a consultant and

625
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,870
you're doing efficient engagement

626
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,159
against an organization that only has 8

627
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:49,620
employees you may be able to do

628
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,659
quantitative and qualitative so the

629
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:57,360
qualitative and the quantitative

630
00:27:53,659 --> 00:28:02,850
quantitative is assigning a firm numeric

631
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:07,229
value to each each level qualitative is

632
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:08,669
like high medium low good average bad

633
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,190
something to that

634
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:15,450
and in some cases there are some things

635
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:17,190
like for example Beijing if you're

636
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,280
talking about activities on phone calls

637
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,080
that could actually call for a mixed

638
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,950
method and the reason I say that is

639
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,760
mixed method is you could measure the

640
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,890
overall sentiment of the phone calls a

641
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:37,500
lot of them were positive couple were

642
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:40,290
neutral and one was negative okay that

643
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,080
those quantity those qualitative

644
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,020
properties would be qualitative but then

645
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,090
you can still measure okay this is the

646
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,440
number of times I called bidding or

647
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,750
here's the number of times I called

648
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,670
here's the amount of time I urged on

649
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,090
each call here's the time I was on each

650
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:00,420
call did you receive any reports and

651
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,980
that does require the client security

652
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,820
team to provide you some forms of

653
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,710
information but with that that would be

654
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,110
mixed method and that's just kind of

655
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,960
getting into the data science part but

656
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,179
that the challenges that rely on this if

657
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,200
you want to do like if we wanted to

658
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,790
apply like big data data science

659
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,660
basically the only thing I thought on

660
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,980
this slide is regression which is

661
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,610
similar to standard deviation it takes a

662
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,610
very large data set and it compares each

663
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:34,649
value to each other value and mass

664
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,169
that's how organizations find out who

665
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,860
the best person to market to this that's

666
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:46,320
that's a very common use case for

667
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:48,240
regression and regarding regression you

668
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,179
have to have a very large data set for

669
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,850
it when I was taking a data science

670
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,710
course in college I one of my

671
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,060
assignments required me to do regression

672
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,060
and actually figure out who the best

673
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:06,060
person to market to was I had 10,000

674
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:08,490
unique rows and I think it was a hundred

675
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,370
and fifty columns I don't remember the

676
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,840
exact number but nevertheless and each

677
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,459
of each thing had been quantified so

678
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,110
that was a data set that was good enough

679
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,760
to get something from if you only have

680
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,530
eight people you're not going to be able

681
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,570
to perform that it's just not

682
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,280
possible another thing would be cluster

683
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:30,210
analysis which is basically doing

684
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,980
comparative regression that is something

685
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,690
that is very similar to what we might

686
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:40,680
call a B testing so getting into the

687
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:44,640
practical application of this well how

688
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,260
would how would we do this well like I

689
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,170
said I'm working on a script that would

690
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,200
actually assist with parts of this and

691
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:55,730
we'd have to integrate it with your same

692
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:59,100
or syslog or Windows logs or whatever

693
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,960
you might have to have some integration

694
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,879
with the ticketing system if that's if

695
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,420
that's your main method of reporting

696
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,790
things and then of course measure

697
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,730
distance and difference between things

698
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,990
using Heacock time like I said I'm

699
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,780
working on it but I've now got it

700
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,150
finished the other thing you could do

701
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,460
with this is actually input a list and

702
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:24,180
say here are the internal non-routable

703
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,540
IP addresses and the users associated

704
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,580
with them so that we can measure based

705
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,860
on the tracking pixel if you decide to

706
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,340
use that in to fish or any other

707
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,320
quantitative method to see who actually

708
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,790
input information and who clicked the

709
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:45,540
window just a side epical unethical

710
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:48,450
sidebar associated with it would be I

711
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:52,860
wouldn't share the information that was

712
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,080
input by the users just because I can't

713
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,229
guarantee that it wouldn't be misused I

714
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,010
would just give a yes/no they input they

715
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:03,570
didn't so if we want to integrate this

716
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,850
with data science I talked about cluster

717
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,419
analysis we could do some level of a be

718
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:11,730
testing with this which would be oh you

719
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:17,610
potentially send two different types of

720
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:20,160
phishing emails to to define groups to

721
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,590
test how they respond to things so that

722
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,570
you can adjust your training based on

723
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,820
the differences between those two emails

724
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,470
could be differences in the links

725
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,960
differences and the verbage differences

726
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,600
in the landing page the delivery it

727
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,790
could be time of day so many variables

728
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,178
with that and then we can bring in other

729
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,678
things

730
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,840
like we're current neural networks and

731
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,220
long short-term memory models which are

732
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,709
even more advanced data science concepts

733
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,299
so in conclusion you don't have to have

734
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,960
a doctorate in data science to be able

735
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,668
to meddle with this to be like really

736
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,320
really really good to the point where

737
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,179
you feel comfortable selling it yeah

738
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,428
probably I'm not trying to sell anything

739
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,759
with this I just like the idea of the

740
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:04,019
metrics I guess in hindsight I might be

741
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,440
trying to sell the book but that's not

742
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:11,429
the ultimate end game that also being

743
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,740
said though ultimately using these data

744
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,769
points and metrics that allows us to

745
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,139
actually provide value to our

746
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:21,029
organization and adjacent organizations

747
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:27,418
whether it be our customers partners or

748
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:30,029
whomever via the additional security so

749
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:33,600
that's that's always a part of it as

750
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:38,149
well and then also as with anything

751
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,360
whether it be malware protection act sec

752
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:42,449
whatever

753
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,080
there's snake oil especially when you're

754
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:48,690
dealing with sales and product teams and

755
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,689
then just keep in mind and this is a

756
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:55,490
very important concept statistics can be

757
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:59,039
manipulated in various ways for

758
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,919
ill-gained so depending on how you frame

759
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,320
the information depending on how you

760
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:08,369
normalize and stem the data set that

761
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,710
will that can affect the way that it is

762
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,169
perceived as well as the way you

763
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,490
visualize it it can have that same

764
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:20,578
impact so for example putting something

765
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:25,199
on a scale from zero to a hundred when

766
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:26,879
the highest value is we'll say 14 that's

767
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,918
gonna make things look very small and

768
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,409
that's just part of the human nature but

769
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,960
if we put it on a scale from zero to

770
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:37,669
twenty or zero to fifty it's going to

771
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,569
look more significant for that reason so

772
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:42,960
keeping in mind the way that we

773
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:44,969
visualize the data that's important as

774
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,520
well but visualization is not a

775
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,520
necessary component of that so

776
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,199
we'll go ahead and start taking

777
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,540
questions in the meantime I'm going to

778
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,450
share some additional slides with you as

779
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,839
well I've got some upcoming training

780
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,160
events online they're all pure virtual

781
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,490
there's short links to get to all of

782
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,430
them I've got coupon codes the 15% off

783
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:11,069
coupon codes that also gets a 15%

784
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,220
donation to the organization associated

785
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:17,400
with it so trace labs women women of

786
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,069
security or operation safe escape I also

787
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,950
created a coupon code for 25% off for

788
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:25,920
besides Knoxville so there's those

789
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,210
coupon codes I've got the basic OSINT

790
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,700
course coming up and the regular

791
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:33,150
expressions course the basic ascent

792
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,859
course is business oriented though

793
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,890
regular expressions course deals with

794
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:40,680
Python based regular expressions and

795
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,420
some decent size data sets

796
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,649
I've also got another missing persons

797
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,540
assent course coming up as well as an

798
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,319
opposite for host and privacy course

799
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,750
same thing with all those coupon codes

800
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:56,670
in cooperation with workshop Khan as

801
00:35:54,750 --> 00:36:01,380
part of the layer a conference I will be

802
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:03,140
giving a full-day person crash course

803
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,339
there's the registration link for that

804
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,529
there's a coupon code in the works it's

805
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:09,839
just not happened yet there's the short

806
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,700
link to it and I did not set the price

807
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,460
on that so I don't have very much

808
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,000
control over it you may or may not be

809
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,150
aware but no search has donated to book

810
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,809
vouchers to give away today they've also

811
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,670
given us a coupon code for 20% all books

812
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:30,500
there are the instructions to do so I've

813
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:34,349
also posted the instructions in the

814
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,880
discord server and it's in a couple of

815
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,930
slides I am going to be sharing my

816
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,640
slides so this will be on schedule

817
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:45,390
if you want to attend a free virtual

818
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,690
conference it was going to be in Atlanta

819
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,490
but it's not anymore it's virtual

820
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:54,150
October 22nd 23rd

821
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:56,729
there's hacker halted so information

822
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:01,520
with that that being said we've got a

823
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,520
few minutes so any questions

824
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,390
you

825
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:09,640
you

826
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:23,450
let's see don't have any in the

827
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:23,450
GoToWebinar let's check track one here

828
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:32,970
we were sharing some memes in the in

829
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,230
track one the Orange County Choppers one

830
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,589
where he's like what do you mean I

831
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:42,060
didn't pass the fish the fishing test

832
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:44,250
haha it's always a good one yeah it's

833
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,470
like why is security saying why are you

834
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,150
clicking this stuff you know and the dad

835
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,779
says if you're so smart why don't you

836
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,040
block those emails in the first place I

837
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,520
mean that's my favorite

838
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,830
I mean being honest I I submitted that

839
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,970
meme to the Maury Povich Show and his

840
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:11,500
test came back that that is not a lie

841
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:14,230
nice so tips tips for

842
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:19,420
thinking about useful metrics is a

843
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:23,740
question that we've got so you've got to

844
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:26,140
think about in regards to what it is

845
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,350
you're trying to achieve what it is

846
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,120
you're trying to learn from it and how

847
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,360
you're going to go about it so basically

848
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,990
is the juice worth the squeeze is the

849
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,880
reward worth the lift so if you're

850
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,479
coming at it from a consulting cent

851
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,880
since you need to collaborate with your

852
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,440
client and say hey if you're trying to

853
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,850
get distance metrics especially as it

854
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,720
relates to reporting I need to know the

855
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,830
exact time that someone reported this

856
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,410
because you're going to know the exact

857
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,120
time you sent the email because

858
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,250
obviously you're the one doing the

859
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,100
fishing so that you can convert both of

860
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,810
those times to epoch time and measure it

861
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,640
in seconds and then if you want to

862
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,250
compare it and you can move that to

863
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,980
minutes and hours that's a matter of

864
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,740
dividing by 60 or 3600 if you want to go

865
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:22,440
directly to hours regarding two ratios

866
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:27,209
same thing you will be able to tell

867
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,920
partially a ratio of how many people

868
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,650
clicked it versus how many people input

869
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,250
information if that's the route you went

870
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:39,430
the problem with that is unless you host

871
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:41,530
the fishing server internally you were

872
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,140
only going to see the organization's not

873
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:46,000
address network address translation so

874
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,819
that's going to be their public address

875
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,140
so that's another opportunity that

876
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,360
you're going to have to collaborate with

877
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,779
the internal security team to be able to

878
00:39:52,360 --> 00:40:01,450
get access to those logs and parse it

879
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:03,840
and break it down that way does that

880
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,839
answer your question

881
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:13,460
I was on the question was on discord so

882
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:20,109
be a good place to jump in later on

883
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:22,910
after after we wrap up here um need yeah

884
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:24,890
it sounds like a you know common problem

885
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,440
is you know like people are expected to

886
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,420
record metrics but just so many of them

887
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,359
are just worthless you know like they

888
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,210
don't really mean much of anything right

889
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,549
and I mean I look at this from two

890
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,470
perspectives one I want to collect all

891
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,369
the metrics because there may be a way

892
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:45,290
that we can eventually figure out how to

893
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:48,020
I'm just gonna use the example of cure

894
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,820
world hunger with this right you might

895
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,670
be able to figure that part out but at

896
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,450
the same time even if we can't solve

897
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:58,640
that problem we may be able to find some

898
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,250
trends that we can build better defenses

899
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,348
with but at the same time I don't want

900
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,630
to spend all of the time creating these

901
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:08,180
metrics doing the analysis doing all

902
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,579
this and that if nothing's ever going to

903
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,078
change and I kind of think that's where

904
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:17,180
a lot of the the world is today because

905
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,750
people we we have a negative

906
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:24,098
unemployment rate well prior to covet

907
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:26,540
and we have people who are significantly

908
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:29,150
overworked that don't have the time to

909
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,009
implement a lot of things and that plays

910
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,750
into it as well and that leads to

911
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:38,510
general frustration about anything

912
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:42,310
though and yet we get feedback that you

913
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:45,940
did answer that first question perfect

914
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:49,279
did you want to talk about no starch

915
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:52,700
yeah I put the slide up here I'll bring

916
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:59,030
it back in there's the new search stuff

917
00:41:52,700 --> 00:42:01,640
so again 20% off their books

918
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:05,390
there's the redemption instructions it's

919
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,480
a valid until May 15th show no starch

920
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:11,560
lots of love because full disclosure

921
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,560
they are my publisher

922
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:23,310
so the secure code warrior championship

923
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:27,180
is done and thank you very much Joe for

924
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:29,190
that that was a great presentation again

925
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,580
lots of good conversation in the in the

926
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,580
channels
