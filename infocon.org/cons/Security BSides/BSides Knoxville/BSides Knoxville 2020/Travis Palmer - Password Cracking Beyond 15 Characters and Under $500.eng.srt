1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,990
got everything managed do you ready to

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,230
go Travis yep just in the ball yep

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,379
so next up is Travis Palmer pasture

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,829
cracking beyond 15 characters and under

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:18,140
$500 without burning down your house I

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:21,320
assume without burning down your house

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,400
or hopefully anybody else's right it

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,400
generates a lot of heat man

9
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:37,190
all right should be able to present

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:40,969
excellent all right whenever you're

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,370
ready all right so yeah this is cracking

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:45,559
beyond 15 characters under $500 other

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,419
titles for this talk for greener

14
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,449
pastures are the computational wall or

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,579
why xkcd advice is easy to understand

16
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:54,559
and hard to do that second one is

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,329
something that my management suggested

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,260
and well we'll get to the reason behind

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,039
that in a second

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,230
so I'm Travis I'm also a nerd so I go by

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,700
the pseudonym tráfico I'm an O SCP osce

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,590
and G mob if those letters mean

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,880
something to you and has this tradition

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,290
for speakers a couple of my favorite

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,850
hobbies outside of security you're along

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,040
the right side arma 3 D & E and BWC yes

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,899
again I am a nerd and my beard is

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,310
nowhere as magnificent as the last two

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,930
speakers of this track so I'm gonna kill

30
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,290
the video now so that you folks can get

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,500
full screen slides and also well we've

32
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,370
got a lot of content to cook through but

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,960
as fast as I basically can so for this

34
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,190
talk we're gonna start with a fair bit

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,839
of background before we get into the

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,670
meat of things I should give a

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,350
disclaimer I have limited time so I

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,420
can't make this an all-inclusive

39
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,220
introductory talk if you've never heard

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,580
of hash gap before and are thinking

41
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,410
where can I adopt one this talk is gonna

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,390
be a little rough to follow just stick

43
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,800
around you'll learn something and you'll

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:57,350
definitely have some keywords to Google

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:00,940
later so let's address well what should

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,940
always be the first question why

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,800
I mean what freezes up terribly we're

48
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,420
gonna have to click it we're gonna have

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,970
to click it well large corporations

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,950
still are using character minimums that

51
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,490
were determined in 1985 by the

52
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,190
Department of Defense to be resistant to

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,470
offline brute-force attacks over a 1200

54
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,609
baud modem and even then they should

55
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,530
have been rotated every couple of months

56
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,600
they also have complexity requirements

57
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,820
that should seem familiar because they

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,769
become pervasive and are largely

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,500
responsible for a lot of people honestly

60
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,120
believing that taking almost any English

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,090
word and adding a number in an

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,460
exclamation point in the end makes it an

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,560
acceptable password spoiler these

64
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,440
policies in isolation have not magically

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,290
become more secure since 1985 and are

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,130
still guarding very sensitive things

67
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,510
thankfully most of these websites and

68
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,340
companies have some additional safety

69
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,220
nuts like detecting questionable login

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:04,450
origins or to a Fae well it's set for

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,100
Wikipedia which well doesn't and

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,450
historically might have actually had one

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,459
of the worst password policies on the

74
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,988
Internet Thank You Troy Hunt for using a

75
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,680
megaphone to broadcast a history here

76
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:16,690
which I just why your fix were zero

77
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,570
character passwords was a one character

78
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,560
requirement there was also a large

79
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,410
number of places where that eight

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,420
character standard well isn't which

81
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,010
frankly is a little baffling given some

82
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,929
of the sensitivity here PCI is the

83
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,340
payment card industry which this only

84
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,130
covers the systems where the payment

85
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,170
card info is stored and that seems a

86
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,760
little lackluster the other side of this

87
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,799
imagine the kind of information somebody

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,510
could collect getting in your facebook

89
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,769
or pornhub account and imagine what they

90
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,709
could do to your reputation by

91
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,450
controlling it we just had a talk about

92
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,370
this on the same track and then there's

93
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,410
eBay and I shouldn't need to explain the

94
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,420
level of financial ruin an auction site

95
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,440
can bring up if somebody else is bidding

96
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,030
for you yeah Wells Fargo a deserving

97
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,950
punching bag perhaps but they just

98
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,410
haven't wizened up that's a 14 character

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,390
limit and is there seriously database

100
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,820
with plaintext credentials limited to 14

101
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,190
characters in the back ends and there's

102
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,959
Netflix it doesn't really make sense why

103
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,450
Netflix accounts get hijacked all the

104
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,829
time I understand the want to make for

105
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,969
pin for number pins usable but really

106
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,859
finally we have a whole suite of devices

107
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,630
in tech and I'll pick on Cisco because I

108
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,090
love them so much that historically by

109
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,100
default no password and the policy might

110
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,010
get set by the person installing it but

111
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,660
you know eight characters suggested this

112
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,789
seems deeply questionable it's

113
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,400
especially as a recommendation when

114
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,190
again those passwords were determined to

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,270
be only resistant to attack some

116
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,310
networks in 1985 well I'm on the trend

117
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,440
of bashing trustworthy sources I should

118
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,360
also talk about NIST the National

119
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,250
Institute of Science and Technology and

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,810
what they say given that what they say

121
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,770
often seeps into government regulation

122
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,020
special publication 800-53 be released

123
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,090
in 2017 said the requirements should be

124
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,000
8 plus characters with no complexity

125
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,830
because someone did the Cystic analysis

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,450
and found out that people actually

127
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,880
produce easier brute force passwords

128
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,090
under complexity requirements like

129
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,680
adding a number and an exclamation point

130
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,549
they also say the maximal links should

131
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,430
be at least 64 characters hmm a hint of

132
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,640
where things might be going there's also

133
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,950
this key section here that says

134
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,539
increased password length is the key

135
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,380
security control and to encourage

136
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,200
passphrases

137
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:36,430
you hear that the future is coming

138
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:39,370
slowly and the late 80s might finally

139
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,020
end soon the most recent guidance in

140
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,490
February of this year my June at the

141
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,620
first time it was published from NIST

142
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,750
and the FBI it was a lot more it's

143
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,340
flicked on this 15 characters without

144
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,110
other complex requirements is where we

145
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,039
should be going in fact we should

146
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,930
require it as soon as possible and this

147
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,060
is in line with what a bunch of other

148
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,980
experts and sources that aren't the

149
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,590
largest tech companies have been saying

150
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,820
for much much longer in fact a security

151
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,530
consulting group that I greatly respect

152
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,360
Black Hills Information Security makes

153
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,159
the suggest in their clients and uses a

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,800
more paranoid standard of 20 characters

155
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,230
internal need though you might be asking

156
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,690
okay why is Black Hills specifically on

157
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,940
here well it's because I'm picking on

158
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,620
them and we're about to listen to some

159
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:27,690
snippets of audio from a webcast last

160
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,690
December I'm not sure if I

161
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,380
the next slide my son's computer he's

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,710
got a gaming computer it takes 8 minutes

163
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,110
to crack an LM hash if you take the same

164
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:50,260
14 character password it would take 4.3

165
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:50,260
billion years policy that they said in

166
00:06:51,340 --> 00:07:09,590
its password policy was secure forever

167
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:15,260
because secure but I mean this

168
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:18,380
technology changes this is warfare right

169
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,120
everything is moved counter move we have

170
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,980
electronic countermeasures you have

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,650
electronic counter countermeasures and

172
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:28,520
then it goes up above that and I lose

173
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,520
track so okay so we're getting questions

174
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,770
about have you run the Google comment

175
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,560
word attack against pass phrases so like

176
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,460
if you just glued words into a cracker

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,790
that doesn't that crack passphrases sure

178
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:49,130
yes it does how many combinations of

179
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:51,050
forward passwords Arthur so how long is

180
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,909
that going to take you what if you start

181
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,520
using words from a foreign dictionary

182
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,680
what if you start putting salts into

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,690
those words like but I just I think it

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,430
for forwards and if you start using

185
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,820
special characters as a spacer between

186
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,710
your words and things like this

187
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:10,430
the question is are you more secure than

188
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:15,890
you were with eight but yes there are

189
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,600
attacks against everything so so daring

190
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,669
kind of summarize this up this from the

191
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,260
field kind of our results but I just

192
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,969
didn't want to talk about it we have no

193
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,789
success with people who have 15

194
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,260
character passwords approaches zero and

195
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,360
we have tried these things now we're

196
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,550
constrained in our time normally we

197
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,440
don't have more than a week or so to do

198
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,960
our password guessing whereas attacker

199
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,370
according to Verizon report they've got

200
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,400
like what nine months something like

201
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,969
that

202
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,770
okay another question Jason yes so this

203
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,790
questions come up a few times are spaces

204
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:52,740
legal yes they they are spacious special

205
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:56,069
character and they are very good and I'm

206
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,290
just gonna cut it right there so there's

207
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,720
a couple of things here and they do give

208
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,969
good recommendations it's solid

209
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,580
reasoning behind this it's impossible to

210
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,930
save an LM hash and when you have more

211
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,990
than 15 character passwords so if those

212
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,120
really old Windows domains yeah this is

213
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,760
really where you need to be going just

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,050
to be absolutely certain and they have a

215
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,490
couple of other pointed recommendations

216
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,930
but perhaps the most interesting thing

217
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,150
mentioned is that they have been given

218
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,040
hashes from a domain with that 15

219
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,560
character passphrase policy specifically

220
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,620
to crack them and the amount that can

221
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,010
crack in one week approaches zero

222
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:36,150
basically no success well pack it in

223
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,220
presentation over that's all folks know

224
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,319
you're not buying that well good because

225
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,970
neither am i and i should address the

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,230
final reason I'm here presenting on this

227
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,640
topic in particular which unfortunately

228
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:52,050
does mean we have to have another quick

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:55,170
sound bite incubator looking at

230
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,180
passwords so passwords are something

231
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,860
that's highly audited because it's it's

232
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,819
very easy to do if you're an auditor and

233
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,470
you're trying to assess whether

234
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,120
somebody's passing muster you can have

235
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,250
this rule set and you can walk in and

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,930
either they pass or they fail and you'll

237
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,160
see a lot of that and a lot of companies

238
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,930
have this password policy to come

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,339
straight out of audits eight characters

240
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,290
and three or four of uppercase lowercase

241
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,910
special characters and numbers I just

242
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,449
rattle it off it's been almost 20 years

243
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,520
of that so um you know we looked at that

244
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,680
though and as we went through the red

245
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,990
teaming we found that one step and what

246
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,880
we call the kill chain if a attacker

247
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,529
were successful and we actually give

248
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,930
them a leg off we actually bring hackers

249
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,790
on and bring them in as take employees

250
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,829
because a laptop of the password they

251
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,420
start and we found one step in the kill

252
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,640
chain was taking all the passwords and

253
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,529
cracking them and they would run

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,350
computers with with graphic processing

255
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,779
unit augmentation and they've run for

256
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,980
hours and they be able to crack a few

257
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,480
passwords and hopefully they find a

258
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,450
privileged account and then they were

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,310
off to the races

260
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,530
so while there was only one step in what

261
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,329
I call the kill chain we decide you know

262
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,939
we want to win that battle and here we

263
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,650
are compliant but it's just not getting

264
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,350
it done I'm just meeting meaning

265
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,459
compliance so we Bram some some math on

266
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,020
the whiteboard and we said well what if

267
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,640
we went out to a really long password 15

268
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,949
characters but got rid of all that

269
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,860
complexity requirements and you know I

270
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,350
have a lot of a lot of people with high

271
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,060
math SAT scores on my team let's put it

272
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,470
that way so we have some great

273
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,550
whiteboard battles and you know how much

274
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,790
better would it be and that sort of

275
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,410
thing what kept creeping in there

276
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,819
because of kind of that tick box

277
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,170
mentality was what we have to have

278
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,960
complexity everybody but we said well

279
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,219
let's just try it out so the math held

280
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,560
and we felt pretty good about it and

281
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,700
then around that time the National

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,160
Institute of Standards and Technology

283
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,930
NIST released an updated standard and

284
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,670
they said what length is king you can

285
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,500
get it longer password you get rid of

286
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,120
some of that stuff as long as you look

287
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,910
for commonly used passwords and block

288
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,120
them out so long story short we did it

289
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,329
and it took about 90 days to roll it in

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,740
and the impact has been substantial and

291
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,480
the only reason we're able to do that is

292
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,460
because we innovated and created this

293
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,380
this thing that we called the Kraken

294
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,600
that every single day tries to crack all

295
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,340
the passwords in the company and we see

296
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,490
the success rate of that machine just

297
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,390
dropping precipitously sod and I'm gonna

298
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:18,910
cut him there but yeah that informations

299
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:21,100
public now so let's quickly recap it 15

300
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,230
characters no complexity yes we cracker

301
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,010
on domains if you remember my job title

302
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,980
yes the above and transitioning to that

303
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,560
15 characters standard was definitely a

304
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,180
good idea but well given the existence

305
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,219
of this presentation you might guess

306
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,010
that it wasn't a silver bullet and it

307
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,470
wasn't so we just start talking about

308
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,810
that math that Jerry mentioned now the

309
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,940
math might hold up but the equation

310
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,439
isn't necessarily realistic there is

311
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,270
more than one way of approaching this

312
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,010
problem and I've heard the argument spun

313
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,770
multiple different ways the first of

314
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,330
which is it's inconceivable to crack 15

315
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,860
character password because brute-forcing

316
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,840
through all the possible numbers and

317
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,480
lowercase letters is 1.6 sextillion

318
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,800
combinations which is yes huge massive

319
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,310
you're not going to crack that on modern

320
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,859
hardware

321
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,268
unless you're the NSA another argument

322
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,249
I've heard that comes from a better

323
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,199
standpoint is assuming the passphrase is

324
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:13,389
made up of words and there are a lot of

325
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,769
words around five characters or more so

326
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,620
you can say that a 15 character

327
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,930
passphrase is probably three words which

328
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,430
is extremely difficult and you'd have to

329
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,609
go through more than 50 quadrillion

330
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,680
options to be sure okay big number but

331
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,199
certainly smaller than the last one and

332
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,638
the last argument I've heard and perhaps

333
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,889
the most educated of these straumann

334
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,600
arguments is based on the common

335
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,069
requirement of eight characters doubling

336
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,259
that gets you just about 15 character

337
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:40,180
requirement and so maybe we could think

338
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,740
about past races as just multiple

339
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,599
passwords combines in which case the

340
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,100
lowest margin for cracking is just

341
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,529
trying all the combinations of two

342
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,649
relatively common passwords or common

343
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,209
passwords which if you're using the

344
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,949
RockYou dictionary well that's still

345
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,109
over two hundred and five trillion which

346
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,370
they'll say is unreasonable well I'm

347
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,620
here to tell you that all of these

348
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,449
arguments that say cracking past 15

349
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,610
characters regardless of reasoning can

350
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,769
be undermined and they can be undermined

351
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,540
by only three factors what are those

352
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,579
factors you might ask are you just

353
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,009
teasing us is this a timeshare scheme

354
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:15,008
and disguise No the big secret

355
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:18,699
weaknesses humans inconceivable

356
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,680
I know specifically humans are bad at

357
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,599
big numbers human packed humans pack

358
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,149
complexity on the ends the ends of

359
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,910
passwords or pass phrases and humans

360
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,680
packet similar humans pick similar

361
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,420
things similar things to other humans

362
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,959
common things are common because they're

363
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,639
commonly picked before I get too far we

364
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,229
should define some limits to what is

365
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,610
reasonable and I should address the

366
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,470
other part of the clickbait II title for

367
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,680
this talk why the 500 other limit

368
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,569
well besides it being a nice round

369
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,429
number that's easy to pitch it's also

370
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,050
the roundabout cost of entertainment

371
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,939
system and you can safely assume that

372
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,829
every type of threat actor you might

373
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,420
needing to be worried about including

374
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,878
low stack and your script kiddies has

375
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,679
access to this amount of money it's also

376
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,269
an amount that can pack a pre sizable

377
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,980
punch regardless of the path you take

378
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,660
either owning a cracking rig or renting

379
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,550
out cloud computing 500 ollars is more

380
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,740
than up to go off and build a small

381
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,099
cracking system out of a use GPU from

382
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,529
ebay and some outdated desktop which

383
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,649
should net you around 53 Giga Giga

384
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,749
hashes a second against ntlm well

385
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:22,290
you can go the route of the cloud and an

386
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:23,670
AWS 500 ollars gets you 68 hours on a

387
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,860
spot instance which yes might get

388
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,920
preempted probably won't though with 8v

389
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,329
100 GPUs which you can do manually or

390
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,430
you can use a management tool like coal

391
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,050
fires NPK to manage the spot instances

392
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,420
for you and both scale and automate the

393
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,219
attack if you are an attacker and what

394
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,529
you're planning on doing is a series of

395
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,110
short running attacks instead of waiting

396
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,660
68 hours for all the results wine

397
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,509
automates fitting up 68 instances and

398
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,040
just get the results in one sadly NPK

399
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,529
doesn't work too well with Google Cloud

400
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,599
which appears to be cheaper and you can

401
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,470
actually squeeze out 83 hours of time on

402
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,420
an instance with 8100 GPUs which besides

403
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,290
being terrifically cheap brings us to a

404
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,599
terrifying theoretical max of 180 9.3

405
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,009
peda hashes of ntlm we can guess not

406
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,029
mega not Giga not tera

407
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:13,829
hedda 189 quadrillion if we compare that

408
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,149
to that last straw man argument of the

409
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,429
rock addiction - on top of itself

410
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,439
sure theoretical isn't real performance

411
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:21,959
but the difference isn't off by a factor

412
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,389
of a thousand times although humans are

413
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,800
bad with big numbers which brings us

414
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,929
around to the second strum at argument

415
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,410
and I'd like to throw in an alternate

416
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,149
equation

417
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,160
mostly jokingly that is still very

418
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,749
conservative for how many guesses it

419
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,759
takes to crack a three-word passphrase

420
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:38,069
all of the passwords that aren't

421
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,779
obsolete to the 3rd power divided by the

422
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,248
number of people in the organization or

423
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,139
the number of hashes an attacker has to

424
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:45,959
crack all of which is divided by the

425
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,449
factor of human laziness squared how do

426
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,429
you quantify human laziness don't ask me

427
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:53,160
but trust me the value of that variable

428
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:55,050
always seems to be greater than one the

429
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,730
very conservative hypothesis here is

430
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,229
that people making a passphrase are

431
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,059
going to use words from languages they

432
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,370
know and can think of during the duress

433
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,049
of password creation I did say this was

434
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,079
going to be very conservative which

435
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:09,029
tends to be a lot more limited set in

436
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,279
fact I'm gonna say right now and support

437
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:13,589
later that pool to pick from four people

438
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,309
it seems to be somewhere between 32,000

439
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,589
at 64 thousand words which bring these

440
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,779
brings me to a point where we need to

441
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,220
break out a lot of math because under

442
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,619
minor number one people are bad at big

443
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,909
numbers thankfully people are good at

444
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,408
spotting trends after they have all the

445
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,210
information and I've done a lot of math

446
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,020
for you up front here so

447
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,149
let me give you something that's

448
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,889
hopefully a lot easier to parse this is

449
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,510
a chart of the actual computational

450
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,899
limits of combining words together an

451
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,149
attack for a single 20/80 TI on ntlm

452
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,649
hashes which i pick only because it's

453
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,899
consumer GPU and i have access to one

454
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,549
the horizontal axis of this chart is the

455
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,229
number of words in a passphrase the

456
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,120
vertical axis is the size of the

457
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,980
dictionary or perhaps a more useful way

458
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,649
to think about it the rarest word and a

459
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,240
password that can be cracked because the

460
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:59,789
logical attacker is going to use a list

461
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,649
of words by frequency the bigger the

462
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:05,370
list is the rare the words are gonna be

463
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:07,889
in it and as for everything else the

464
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,658
numbers in the boxes are the amount of

465
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,429
minutes to complete an attack in that

466
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,690
search face of the passphrase and the

467
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,370
coloration tells you how long that time

468
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,529
is relative to minutes hours days weeks

469
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,000
months or years because I'm not gonna

470
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,760
lie I don't know off the top of my head

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,929
how many minutes are in a week now going

472
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,250
down or to the right exponentially

473
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,350
increases the amount of work needed and

474
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,880
there are some jumps and difficulty that

475
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,408
are sharp and this is where the idea of

476
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,870
a computational wall comes in a

477
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,940
seemingly sudden increase in difficulty

478
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,590
that you just can't go over but of

479
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,919
course this is only the chart for a

480
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,090
consumer GPU what about if you 100 well

481
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,950
it's actually not that much different

482
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,480
there are reasons why a V 100 should be

483
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,610
much better but it isn't a variable for

484
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,919
this chart anyway what if we had more

485
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,260
than one GPU what if we have eight just

486
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,090
like those cloud instances well the

487
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,370
charts gonna shift down a little bit and

488
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,139
open up some options those of you that

489
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,399
notice the size of the numbers we're

490
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,799
dealing with in the vertical axis

491
00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:00,809
already probably have some nightmares to

492
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,020
take home but I'm gonna make sure

493
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:06,480
everyone else has them too and the two

494
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,940
word column that is more than 16 million

495
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,890
words in 20 minutes basically every word

496
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,840
actually in use from every language

497
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,270
spoken by at least 1% of the world's

498
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,158
population fits in here with room to

499
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,440
spare for a couple extra million common

500
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,120
passwords and the three word column that

501
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,279
is every non obsolete word in the

502
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,379
English language that is testable in a

503
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,970
matter of hours and the forward column

504
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,950
we have a sizable chunk of commonly used

505
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,840
words where a targeted attacks a

506
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,610
scraping from memos or websites or

507
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,570
targeting individual people makes sense

508
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,729
now before I get too excited someone I'm

509
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,830
sure has been thinking okay cool but

510
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,960
that's ntlm what about a slower actually

511
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,199
quote unquote secure hash well here's

512
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
the same chart for

513
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,210
five twelve eunuchs and you'll notice

514
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,580
there's still viable attacks on two in

515
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,470
three word passphrases and here's B

516
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,658
krypter Blowfish configured the UNIX

517
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,909
defaults although we do lose a lot of

518
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,340
capability we can still go after two

519
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,500
word pass phrases as an attacker this

520
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,059
chart does make me sad but the reality

521
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,360
of most corporations using Windows is

522
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:09,549
that there will be some where something

523
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,559
using a hash like ntlm for quite a while

524
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:14,110
to come and as far as the individual

525
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,908
user is concerned they need to have a

526
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,979
passphrase that isn't going to get

527
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,899
cracked when the hashes get dumped

528
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,940
either inside their institution or when

529
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:23,590
a website that they use it's all of its

530
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,940
passwords done by SQL injection and

531
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,500
let's be real a lot of major websites

532
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,419
and companies keep on getting caught

533
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,649
with their pants down and we only find

534
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:31,570
out they're using a fast hash the hard

535
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,729
way not to mention the difficulty of

536
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,990
computing hash is a linear factor in a

537
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,059
world where computing power it's

538
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,250
increasing exponentially so I'm going

539
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,870
back to the other chart because it's

540
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,460
time to get into the attacker mindset

541
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,799
and play a game of bad recommendations

542
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,960
they're first up is Google and yes the

543
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,549
advice is old but the advice much like

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,220
their policy hasn't been updated in more

545
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,720
than a decade I love sandwiches isn't a

546
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,399
great example and that mix of leet-speak

547
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,990
in case shifting doesn't actually do

548
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,370
much for the difficulty I'll be generous

549
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,159
and say it makes about a hundred times

550
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,139
harder in terms of the rarity the slide

551
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,240
shows were various walls various words

552
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:06,789
fall on Google's own most searched words

553
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
and the most frequently occurring words

554
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,679
in the English Wikipedia that's the G

555
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,570
number and the W number the fact of the

556
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,610
matter here is that the underlying

557
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,529
phrases crackable in under three minutes

558
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,120
and so even giving them the benefit they

559
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,549
doubt on the difficulty of guessing

560
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,100
leet-speak substitutions it's crackable

561
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,899
in 244 minutes and I should also mention

562
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,610
the recommendation put forth in the

563
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,709
absolute latest NIST an FBI

564
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,519
recommendation because they suggested a

565
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,840
passphrase voices protected 2020 we are

566
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,510
but then suggested that a passphrase

567
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,399
that's even better is director month

568
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,090
learned truck because the words are

569
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,250
unrelated

570
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,600
while those words might seem unrelated

571
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,850
but they all have one thing in common

572
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,309
and that's that they're all AI searingly

573
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,799
Khan the rarest word here is truck and

574
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,600
hoo boy that's in the top 4,000 words

575
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,850
regardless of the list you choose for

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,100
common words are not safe from offline

577
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:05,800
which does bring up another perhaps more

578
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,060
viral recommendation xkcd 936 now a lot

579
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,990
of people have used this as password

580
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,060
advice including management

581
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,610
IntercontinentalExchange and the matter

582
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:16,030
of it is the math in ex-ac DS advice as

583
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:18,370
written is fine because it was written

584
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,800
to handle an online attack where the

585
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,199
rate of guessing is only 1,000 a second

586
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,909
now there is a claim here that the

587
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,340
average user shouldn't have to worry

588
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,440
about attacks and cracks on a stolen

589
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,600
hash but I'm here to tell you from

590
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,550
experience the average user doesn't

591
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,860
attend a security conference and reuses

592
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,510
passwords the average user also works at

593
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,040
a company and if that company is larger

594
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,450
than a couple dozen people they should

595
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,970
worry about stone there dumps hashes

596
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,920
both from their infrastructure and their

597
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,060
websites that the users are using both

598
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,510
professionally and personally

599
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,820
a for common passwords yeah isn't safe

600
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,290
from offline attacks if anything the

601
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,939
xkcd example is actually a little

602
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,620
stronger than intended because staple

603
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,620
isn't actually that comment of a word

604
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,330
it's number 11,000 367 on the Wikipedia

605
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,909
frequency list and just completely off

606
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,610
the end of the Google list and the low

607
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,980
of entropy xkcd says is a common word

608
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,290
well if we say common words are words

609
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,690
that are in the first 2048 and the

610
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,120
attackers well they're gonna win all the

611
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,750
way out to six word phrases yes really

612
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,340
six now there are some caveats and the

613
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,950
real world isn't as simple as the excel

614
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,110
sheet so before we get into rovol the

615
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,640
results and the mechanics of attacks we

616
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,139
should very quickly cover the things

617
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,850
that are going to be ever-present when

618
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,990
attacking these passwords using a GPU

619
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:36,490
the first of which is the dictionaries

620
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,830
and specifically the size of the

621
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,230
dictionaries there is a lot of bandwidth

622
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,449
to go around for operations within a GPU

623
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,570
and its memory but transferring data to

624
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,730
the GPU while PCIe gen3 by 16 is only 16

625
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,230
gigabytes a second max theoretical not

626
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,930
real world and that might seem like a

627
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,060
lot but that is against 16 billion

628
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,470
theoretical byte that's 16 billion

629
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,300
theoretical bytes per second and modern

630
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,300
GPU can do twenty six billion real

631
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,860
hashes of passphrase per second and one

632
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,080
of these numbers doesn't fit within the

633
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,570
other and also is real not theoretical

634
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,850
the other limitation to be mindful in

635
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,770
terms of what kind of attacks are

636
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,300
possible is the nature of CUDA

637
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,590
unified device architecture I'm not

638
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,230
gonna talk about the AMD equivalent for

639
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,070
sake of time cores on the GPU and what

640
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,780
they can do which is well not a lot they

641
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,520
were built to do lots of single

642
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,649
instruction multiple data computations

643
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,100
on matrices and vectors of your graphics

644
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,560
which means lots and lots of units that

645
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,909
can do arithmetic Hale use and not a lot

646
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,679
of space or silicon devoted to

647
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,300
controlling the nature of single

648
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,940
instruction mobile data means groups or

649
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,409
in this diagram rows of Al use all need

650
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,090
to be doing the same thing at the same

651
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,470
time and those instructions in a

652
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,090
significant portion of the data need to

653
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,560
fit into a smaller shared cache and oh

654
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,300
right the instructions is better be

655
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,310
simple and something can actually do

656
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,919
because it's something it's not actually

657
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,929
implemented and it's not gonna work and

658
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,310
this is where we have to say quick thank

659
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,110
you to the hash cottage on the Ripper

660
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,810
Deb's because oftentimes the best bet in

661
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,580
those programs is the best way I

662
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,419
actually do it on a GPU anyway and

663
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,870
you're better off just finding a

664
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,880
workaround so thank you to those dents

665
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,620
let's talk techniques and results first

666
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,210
dictionary attacks basically checking

667
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,070
through a massive list of passwords in a

668
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,660
file with or without GPU generating some

669
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,490
additional similar candidates to crack

670
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,890
through rules we'll do more on that

671
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,540
later IntercontinentalExchange we've

672
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,980
been running a dictionary attack during

673
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,680
the period Jerry mentioned in that sound

674
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,290
bite and we rolled out the 15 character

675
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,080
policy and as you can see this graph of

676
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,970
the average length of a crack password

677
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,590
well the policy wasn't just successful

678
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,790
it caused some rapid jumps and links

679
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,860
when it actually started getting forced

680
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,840
and after implantation the average

681
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,149
length evened out despite some outlying

682
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,159
spikes this is of course the less

683
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,780
interesting half of this story this is

684
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,980
the graph of the percentage of passwords

685
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,760
that are cracked in dictionary attacks

686
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,930
yes that number in the upper left is 50%

687
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,370
dictionary attacks are very good when

688
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,080
you have a dictionary of passwords made

689
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,129
under the same password policy targeted

690
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,530
and yes

691
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,780
dictionaries also aren't very good after

692
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,879
people change their password out under

693
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,290
significantly differed and better policy

694
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,190
and start picking things that just

695
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,990
aren't going to be in a dictionary

696
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,930
anymore in fact if we overlay the two

697
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,610
graphs we see multiple downward shifts

698
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,400
in the number of crack passwords even

699
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,350
after the average cracked password says

700
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,670
puffs 15 they have it's the length of

701
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,709
those cracks they have sir it's about 15

702
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,390
characters as further enforcement for

703
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,220
changing crack passwords was rolled out

704
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,650
until it settled somewhere around the

705
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,290
one-percent range

706
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,270
didn't approach zero it held down near a

707
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,129
certain percentage there's always

708
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:34,110
somebody picking and REE picking a

709
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,130
terrible password these graphs are

710
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,270
trimmed so it doesn't show anything

711
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,320
that's happened particularly recently

712
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,120
but I assure you

713
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,860
straight dictionary attacks have not had

714
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,280
much success but they've also definitely

715
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,959
not gone zero sorry Black Hills so let's

716
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,490
talk Combinator attacks attacks centered

717
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,290
around combining multiple dictionaries

718
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,370
or the same dictionary onto itself the

719
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,450
attacks pretty straightforward we've

720
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,250
already kind of talked about in those

721
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,160
computational limit slides so let's get

722
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,470
right into the results and well here is

723
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,179
the charts of every s phrase password

724
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,950
longer than 15 characters ever attracted

725
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,360
in your account no exchange that was

726
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,250
crackable with the small dictionary of

727
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,270
words or common passwords and organized

728
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,590
to reflect the charts from that

729
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,600
computational wall part of the

730
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,830
presentation earlier and in order to do

731
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,020
this item modify an algorithm for

732
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,669
dissecting passwords called CXC BBN I

733
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,080
highly recommend it but it does have one

734
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,790
particular issue and that it doesn't

735
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,139
handle common separators like spaces

736
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,159
between passwords and a passphrase and

737
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,540
apparently the creator's just didn't

738
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,190
think that was important and still

739
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,070
haven't added it anyway I digress

740
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,500
a password a passphrase is slotted here

741
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,419
when you fix the algorithm based on how

742
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,490
many elements usually words but

743
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,470
sometimes a common password CX CBN

744
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,179
believes it's made up of and the rear

745
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,920
the rarity of the rarest element is

746
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,410
based on the number of us is required

747
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,300
which should roughly dictate the size of

748
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,400
the source dictionary required we can

749
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,770
see there's a rather precipitous

750
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,320
drop-off somewhere between 30 2016 4

751
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,510
thousand along with a pretty significant

752
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,730
preference for three element pass races

753
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,200
which hmm might have had something to do

754
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,260
with certain recommendation package with

755
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,660
the policy mmm-hmm now this is neat Mel

756
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,820
but what about other data sets say not

757
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,559
from this company well I considered

758
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,850
calling up various companies with a 15

759
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,110
character policy and seeing if they're

760
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,809
willing to give me their password hashes

761
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,209
but it seemed unlikely so I kinda had to

762
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:17,340
artificially make one here's the results

763
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,140
from over 37 million hashes from the

764
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,730
have I been poned version two collection

765
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,170
where every password known to be less

766
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,059
than 15 characters long has been

767
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,800
stripped out and this is really only

768
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,899
possible because 90% of this list has

769
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,790
already been cracked both of the attacks

770
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,530
here are pretty shallow and short

771
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,090
running and a large cart a large part

772
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,280
because I only need to prove a point and

773
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,689
also the hashed right here is going to

774
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,040
be artificially terrible this is going

775
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,180
to be a recurring theme because when you

776
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,460
cross-check 30

777
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,480
million hashes for a match it slows you

778
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,700
down a little bit

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,820
most domains do not contain 37 million

780
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,130
people that being said this is one point

781
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,860
one four percent of all the pass phrases

782
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,260
in the dataset in one attack in less

783
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,280
than three minutes are you scared yet

784
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,150
good because this is an example of what

785
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,530
happens when you use a lot more

786
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,540
candidates and you actually start

787
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,820
checking for combinations of passwords

788
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,020
inside a pass rates if you still

789
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,669
remember that third strawman argument oh

790
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:15,200
this is the entire RockYou data set on

791
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:18,060
top of itself and yeah you can do it and

792
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,950
it takes one day in 16 hours in this

793
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,179
very weird case on one GPU we're

794
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,520
cross-checking 37 million hashes

795
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,290
normally this only takes 16 minutes on a

796
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,210
single machine and AWS or Google cloud

797
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,360
to do this and it cost single-digit

798
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,040
dollars now that I've got the would-be

799
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,419
crackers it's sighted there are some

800
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,580
technical shortfalls with hash cut that

801
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,440
need to be quickly noted the combination

802
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,790
mode only takes two files input so

803
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,590
you're gonna if you want to use this

804
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:43,020
with hash ket and you do want to use

805
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,060
this with hash cap you're gonna have to

806
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,770
make some intermediary dictionaries to

807
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,419
go after those three and for element

808
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,240
pass raises being mindful ooh of

809
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,650
exponential file size it's also a

810
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,240
similar deal for hybrid mode which only

811
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,910
takes one word list and one mask file

812
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,560
you could use other programs and pipe in

813
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,970
candidates but you pay the piper when

814
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,580
doing so on a fast hash you can only

815
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,630
transfer so many things for a PCI you

816
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,189
the other thing hash guide isn't going

817
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,810
to do for you is generate variants of a

818
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,010
passphrase candidate with spaces and

819
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,040
capitalization that people are actually

820
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,000
going to be generally using which well

821
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,860
from what I've seen you're gonna want to

822
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,110
use title case sentence and lower case

823
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,149
both within without spaces easiest way

824
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,500
to do this is with individual rules on a

825
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,900
Combinator attack starting with a

826
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,610
pre-process dictionary that already has

827
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,810
the spaces between capitalized words and

828
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,600
then you can just manipulate it you sign

829
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,810
off you with the J and K rules to get

830
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,159
these spaces and capitalization desired

831
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,290
which on the topic of it's another

832
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,790
shortfall you can only use one set of

833
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,190
rules for word lists in combination mode

834
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,990
yes sorry if you want to check lots of

835
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,090
different things using girls like common

836
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,810
words in between two words you're going

837
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,159
to need a honking massive bash file or

838
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,929
another program to manage it for you and

839
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,580
this is actually what trusted sex hate

840
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,650
crack is doing behind the scenes when

841
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,110
they for what they call middle or

842
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,840
thorough

843
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,428
combinator text alright enough about the

844
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,320
conditions of commentators we're not

845
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,210
gonna go back there let's move on to

846
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,370
Prince attacks which despite the other

847
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,960
name for the attack has actually nothing

848
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,320
to do with the artist formerly known as

849
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,840
Prince is a acronym for probability

850
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,309
infinite change elements but its purpose

851
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,350
is simple take the path of least

852
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,910
resistance and find more passphrases

853
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,949
sooner by outputting shorter length

854
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,750
candidates first not only is the search

855
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,520
space a little bit smaller but we can

856
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,470
also expect to find more passphrases

857
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,150
here because people tend to pick

858
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,520
passphrases close to the minimum

859
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,190
required effort this overlap of least

860
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,910
resistance motivation is just great for

861
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,919
an attacker

862
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,809
how does Prince work well and adjusts a

863
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:36,520
word list it sorts all the contents by

864
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,250
length and puts them into separate lists

865
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,929
and then begins producing candidates at

866
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,299
the minimum the specified length out of

867
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:44,950
the lists of various links iterating

868
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:46,660
through all the possible combinations of

869
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,390
lists until all the options are

870
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,970
exhausted at which point it moves on to

871
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,410
making longer candidates now after the

872
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,150
explanation of how Prince works you

873
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,280
might be wondering okay why not just use

874
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,780
Combinator's of length cut lists aren't

875
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,460
Princeton hash get separate programs

876
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,780
when I have to pay the piper wasn't that

877
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,919
terrible for performance and you just

878
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,168
say that a couple minutes ago

879
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,600
well yes you do have to pay the piper

880
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:09,850
and you could manually manage all these

881
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,530
attacks with a Combinator but it gets

882
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,090
pretty crazy to manage all the lists and

883
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,460
combinations for three and forward

884
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,649
elements it's doable but you really need

885
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,290
another programmer script or some

886
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,570
solution that circumvents this and comes

887
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:26,860
right on back to one of the undermining

888
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:28,780
factors this is the positions of

889
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,879
dictionary elements in pass phrases here

890
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,710
at the bottom and larger numbers mean

891
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,059
more pass phrases contained an element

892
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,059
straight out of a dictionary in that

893
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:38,230
position and this is again data from

894
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,629
inner accountant let's change and

895
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,370
there's some one heck of a disparity

896
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,990
between the last position in the pass

897
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,149
phrase and the rest the pass phrase in

898
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:50,080
terms of how likely it is to contain a

899
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:51,880
dictionary word that's because humans

900
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,590
pack complexity on the ends mostly on

901
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,730
the end but sometimes on the beginning

902
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:59,678
so the fix for prints is terrible hash

903
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,860
rate on fast hash is when it's piped in

904
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:06,010
its rules because when you use the

905
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,090
default hash cat well you can beat in an

906
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,570
entire file that can

907
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:15,689
however many rules you want and you're

908
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:18,759
pretty in the clear here but there's

909
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,620
kind of a one problem it's most the rule

910
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,360
sets out in the internet and that are

911
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,279
actually big enough to make use of all

912
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,100
the GPUs horsepower while they're not

913
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:30,190
focused on these prefixes and suffixes

914
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,418
that are tacked on on the ends for that

915
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,210
one you're gonna need something else

916
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:36,669
which I actually have you covered

917
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,620
I made a particular word list that is

918
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:39,940
thrown up and a github repo that will be

919
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,029
mentioned a little bit later that

920
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,769
contains 4175 rules and soon to come

921
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:46,809
also be releasing a prefix and suffix

922
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,009
lists based on the frequency data of the

923
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,928
crack passwords in the haven't been

924
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:52,419
poned version to list and this really

925
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:54,070
just focuses on previous instance 20/20

926
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:57,789
your exclamation point your exclamation

927
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,529
point number you get it so let's talk at

928
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,080
success rates for prints now the kicker

929
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:04,480
here is we'll be making use of the

930
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,178
rulers dimensions so there's not going

931
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,770
to be any single element passphrases

932
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,168
but we see a repeat of an earlier trend

933
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,579
namely a sudden drop-off between thirty

934
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:14,408
two thousand sixty four thousand and

935
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:18,040
some clustering around three elements

936
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:20,859
including that suffix or prefix so yeah

937
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:26,219
it's it's almost like everybody's doing

938
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:28,418
the same thing Oh like kinda bar and

939
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,918
well this works really well for

940
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:33,158
assessing up pass phrases but what about

941
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:35,259
a larger data set well we can also see

942
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,270
the reason people like using prints

943
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,220
attacks both of these attacks are the

944
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,159
RockYou password dictionary at the

945
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,888
source and both I stopped at the same

946
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,050
time at 1/8 the runtime of the rock you

947
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,460
on top of itself Combinator and that

948
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,690
entire that complete attack I had

949
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,220
mentioned earlier in the Combinator

950
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,069
section that took one day in 16 hours

951
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:56,348
and I'll it got five point eight two

952
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:59,410
percent well these are getting almost

953
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:01,119
half of that in 1/8 the time they manage

954
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,799
to concentrate a significant portion of

955
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,020
that success very early in the cracking

956
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,089
the other comparison to note here is

957
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,640
while these are kind of the same attack

958
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:11,319
with one exception and that prince was

959
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:16,540
basically unrestricted for one of these

960
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:17,770
attacks head there's for some reason it

961
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,329
might just be this data set might be

962
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,609
others but there's a significant man it

963
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,499
man

964
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:23,720
to focusing on only three element

965
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:25,459
passphrases and that's because we're

966
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,019
also using that role Syd mentioned

967
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,509
earlier trying to fix the prefixes and

968
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:33,319
suffixes but it does still show up here

969
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:35,839
and it's notable again - right here is

970
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:37,249
pretty abysmal so these timings these

971
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,720
attacks go much much quicker when you

972
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:40,399
actually have an instance or more GPUs

973
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,919
to work with and not checking 37 million

974
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,390
hashes and speaking of fast it's about

975
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,369
time I get to the new and shiny weird

976
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,970
level Markov chains for going after pass

977
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,410
phrases that are at their core phrases

978
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,089
what our word level Markov chains well

979
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,799
the simplest explanation I can give is

980
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:56,538
that it's an over glorified state model

981
00:35:54,799 --> 00:36:00,079
to store relationships between groups of

982
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:02,390
words and for this example we'll do a to

983
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,579
a 2 gram model think 2 elements in the

984
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,220
state and if the phrase were used for

985
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,289
the training is the cows eat grass a 2

986
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,049
gram model will record state transitions

987
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,789
for the cows to eat and cows eat to

988
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:14,630
grass

989
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:16,730
obviously this isn't terribly useful

990
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,950
model by itself but imagine if it had

991
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,599
some more training data say some

992
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,999
hundreds thousands or millions of

993
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,529
sentences the intent here is to build up

994
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:26,569
a model of the relationships between

995
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:28,309
groups of words and if we want to be

996
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:29,569
more accurate we can also increase the

997
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,369
number of elements in the state and

998
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,819
raise the number of gram at the model of

999
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,880
the three

1000
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:36,950
now there is one pre-existing proof of

1001
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,420
concept for this that I could find that

1002
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,970
actually would generate output fast

1003
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,380
enough to be useful in password cracking

1004
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,689
sadly however it was single-threaded

1005
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,430
written in a mix of c-sharp and c++ and

1006
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,099
designed for a Windows compile target

1007
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,538
which simply wouldn't do for my purposes

1008
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,130
on Linux so I created something in

1009
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:54,739
similar in Python that's parallel uses

1010
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,319
existing libraries and is a little more

1011
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,079
multi-platform the nature of Python how

1012
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,579
well does it do well the astute members

1013
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,989
of the audience when I showed this table

1014
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,670
on the right of every passphrase crack

1015
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,609
that was Combinator findable might have

1016
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,249
noticed some members that are a little

1017
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:12,230
too far to the lower right based on the

1018
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:14,149
computational complexity charts we went

1019
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,460
through before let me tell her that

1020
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,319
chart for you now the very student view

1021
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,299
might also infer that I did not in fact

1022
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,730
have the limit unlimited access to 81

1023
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:24,470
hundreds and also this chart is

1024
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,819
strangely positioned in the slide almost

1025
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,439
as if it extends further to the right

1026
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:30,259
well it does

1027
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,450
I had a single 20 atti for my research

1028
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:33,300
and I was also heavily timebox so

1029
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,759
everything here that

1030
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,160
the shade of green not from accommodator

1031
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,100
attack admittedly not a delusion results

1032
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,299
but come on years little years with

1033
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,120
accommodating attack but not have

1034
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,250
yielded some of these and a couple out

1035
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,750
of the six and seven element column do

1036
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,380
you any idea how long ten to the

1037
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,580
thirteen minutes is it's millennia

1038
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,380
clearly I'm very happy but what about

1039
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,720
the much larger dataset well it's a

1040
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,020
similar story these attacks are very

1041
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:04,709
quick even on a stunted artificial case

1042
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:07,200
here and I'll be doing a couple of words

1043
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,360
but admittedly they don't pull on too

1044
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,029
much only tens of thousands you know

1045
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,440
whatever the other fact here likely at

1046
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,540
play here is there just isn't that many

1047
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,520
pass phrases that are also phrases that

1048
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,620
exist in this data set and the three and

1049
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,880
four word area and while I'm here I'd

1050
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,990
also like to point out there's an

1051
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,520
accuracy trade-off I did that thing

1052
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,680
again where I did almost the same attack

1053
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,600
twice well the difference is for the two

1054
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,779
forward attacks one of these attacks is

1055
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,170
to Graham yellow ones three green sighs

1056
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:37,640
the model the accuracy of the model and

1057
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:40,740
well there's an accuracy trade-off here

1058
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,020
it's pretty intense

1059
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,390
actually the three Graham got a little

1060
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,660
over half as much but took only 1/12 the

1061
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,310
time now before people get too

1062
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,020
uninterested here I really should show

1063
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,460
them much more impressive slide which is

1064
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,160
what happens when you put this to use on

1065
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,660
even longer phrases and well there

1066
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,399
really shouldn't be much out here in

1067
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,109
this search space but people seem really

1068
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,450
content to just use phrases at this

1069
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,010
length probably because they're these

1070
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,319
should be safe according to most

1071
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,880
everyone's advice and these aren't even

1072
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,740
really common phrases they're actually

1073
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,050
just kind of normal phrases

1074
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,560
here's some examples of what isn't safe

1075
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:19,200
anymore that entire left side is actual

1076
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,090
passwords and these probably aren't past

1077
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,379
phrases or passwords you were expecting

1078
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,120
to leave here knowing or crackable and

1079
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,280
certainly not crackable in one two or

1080
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,410
nine hours speeds barely over one Giga

1081
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,480
hash a second do you have nightmares yet

1082
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,850
because everything here was generated by

1083
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,460
a Markov model in a simple hash cat rule

1084
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,750
set and we didn't do any targeting no

1085
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,820
dumb passwords as input no

1086
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,780
cherry-picking shanigan x' the training

1087
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:44,520
data is completely agnostic admittedly

1088
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,900
it does produce some strange candidates

1089
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,630
sometimes and i've collected some of the

1090
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,830
reader ones i've seen on the right

1091
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,960
I don't know how we went from

1092
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,700
intrauterine pressure catheters to Kiwi

1093
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,290
or Kiwis I can only assume one of the

1094
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,879
websites scraped for the trend ghetto

1095
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,680
was a blog post about making Kiwi or

1096
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,369
Kiwis with an embedded catheter cowboy

1097
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,470
advertisement I really don't know now I

1098
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,839
should head off some common questions

1099
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,609
I'm anticipating some of you familiar

1100
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,160
with haschke might be thinking doesn't

1101
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:13,250
ash that already have Markov chains why

1102
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,720
can't they do this well yes it does it

1103
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,369
has a premade model for character level

1104
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,959
predictions when you start trying to

1105
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,970
stretch it out to 15 character passwords

1106
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,619
and what you want is basically multiple

1107
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,629
actual word world

1108
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,609
multiple actual words that model foals

1109
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,930
are part really quickly not to mention

1110
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:29,000
it doesn't store relationships between

1111
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,640
words and it will basically never finish

1112
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,080
because the search space is at least 333

1113
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,960
sextillion combinations are depending on

1114
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,060
the particular mascar use them and if

1115
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,589
you're thinking haven't you tried GPT 2

1116
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,450
or some other machine learning algorithm

1117
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:42,950
my answer is have you considered hash

1118
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,598
rates Markov chains are actually a

1119
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,368
really good fit for this because they

1120
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,349
are quick especially compared to massive

1121
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,880
models like GPU 2 which by itself is

1122
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:52,070
more than 5 gigabytes intends to take

1123
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,470
multiple seconds to pop out a single

1124
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,700
prediction we need millions of

1125
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,169
predictions per second for it to be

1126
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,118
remotely viable and password cracking

1127
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,290
the other side of this is the more

1128
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,690
advanced models are focused on making

1129
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,279
paragraphs and complete pages currently

1130
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,020
need sentences there are very few

1131
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,420
passphrases have seen that resemble more

1132
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,250
than a sentence fragment

1133
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,440
alright head back out of the weeds here

1134
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,280
time to wrap up and summarize because if

1135
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,810
you're not an attack you you've probably

1136
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,400
been sitting through this talk mildly

1137
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,770
terrifying for some kind of

1138
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,410
recommendation allow me to wait allow me

1139
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,420
free to let you wait slightly longer by

1140
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,670
addressing the red teamers first red

1141
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:31,010
teamers please don't cop-out 15

1142
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,990
character passwords or pass phrases are

1143
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,460
hard but they aren't that hard to crack

1144
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,020
even against a be crip you should at

1145
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,280
least be doing Combinator's prints

1146
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,050
attacks and Markov chains for the

1147
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,099
duration of your engagement don't

1148
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,960
pretend that your results should

1149
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,910
approach 0 it should never be 0 and

1150
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,040
there will always be somebody who picks

1151
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:49,430
hello spring 2020 as their passphrase

1152
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,589
blue teen your turn finally do the math

1153
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,210
that applies to your situation and do a

1154
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:55,279
little more than just gather some people

1155
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,750
that score highly on SAT a decade or

1156
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,000
more ago in a recompensed room and

1157
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,230
whiteboard it if intercepted or dumped

1158
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,760
hashes or

1159
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,670
personal password reuses our concern for

1160
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,960
you and it almost always should be feel

1161
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,420
free to use my math and represent it

1162
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,490
unless your organization is cracking its

1163
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,100
own passwords you won't know what people

1164
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,649
are using recommend the best behaviors

1165
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,359
but plan for the worst which brings me

1166
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,920
to something that can maybe serve as a

1167
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,380
starting point for what to pass along to

1168
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,090
end users and this is my personal

1169
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,280
recommendation and a starting point so

1170
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,109
you better bet it's fairly paranoid but

1171
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,170
the intent here is to make sure a hash

1172
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:32,600
can't be cracked in $500 for expense

1173
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,060
regardless of the type of hash which

1174
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,650
means making an illogical unlikely

1175
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,150
phrase of five or more relatively

1176
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,250
uncommon words that are thematically

1177
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,320
unrelated we're talking about diabetic

1178
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,050
unicorn traps Chicago tunnel as a

1179
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,369
passphrase and unless you force these

1180
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,660
hacker to use a large dictionary

1181
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:49,130
combining all the different types of

1182
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,839
words cities structures fantasy

1183
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,780
creatures verbs medical conditions and

1184
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,770
use some words that are uncommon you're

1185
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,270
going to be building your security

1186
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,619
posture with some cracks already built

1187
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:01,340
into the foundation especially if you're

1188
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:08,900
working with fast hashes all right any

1189
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:13,369
questions all right let's see here

1190
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:15,440
none in the GoToWebinar I did see a

1191
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:17,780
couple people mention that their brains

1192
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,050
might have exploded from them the math

1193
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:23,720
on a few of those slides there yeah I

1194
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:26,060
said we'll apologize I have a bad habit

1195
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,910
of trying to pack a ton in but it is

1196
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:32,060
recorded so yeah if you could have your

1197
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:35,060
pocket this morning yeah it's wonderful

1198
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:38,060
stuff how difficult is it to get started

1199
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:41,540
cracking on these for the red team

1200
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,400
that's one question I see well so I mean

1201
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,279
I can put it this way all of the data

1202
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,980
that was collected here was with attacks

1203
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,440
using only one GPU so admittedly I was

1204
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,300
targeting pretty fast hashes but I have

1205
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,760
a personal machine that's been cooking

1206
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,170
away at the right of me and I have a

1207
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,190
machine for my corporate environment

1208
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,350
that remains inside the corporate

1209
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,470
environment that we do cracking on to

1210
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,580
crack our own domain and that one again

1211
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,259
doesn't have very much in it so you

1212
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:10,850
definitely can get going with just a

1213
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:17,060
consumer GPU and as far as good places

1214
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:22,970
to start yes we got one I knew at least

1215
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:25,549
one as far as getting started I will say

1216
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,009
the hash Catman page is a little

1217
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:30,140
hilariously daunting and it actually

1218
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,369
doesn't have all of hash Katz's line

1219
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,350
arguments in it so you actually have to

1220
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,630
go to hashtag org if you want all of the

1221
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:37,100
information on it and I would strongly

1222
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,050
recommend seeking out because there have

1223
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,109
been a lot of videos in the past by

1224
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:44,000
other people who speak a lot slower than

1225
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:48,980
I do and are much better at explaining

1226
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,380
things than I do yeah um yeah hopefully

1227
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,359
that GPU gets do some fun stuff not just

1228
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:57,609
cracking passwords gets to do some

1229
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:01,220
halflife Alex something like that yep ah

1230
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:04,190
let's see I know I saw at least one

1231
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,930
other one in here is there any password

1232
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,520
cracking that uses machine learning to

1233
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,580
come up with better algorithms than

1234
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,600
these straight up learning what people

1235
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:16,369
generally do yeah so there are a couple

1236
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,529
of things that people have put forward

1237
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:19,390
though they tend to still at they're

1238
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,789
like

1239
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,500
core work off of Markov chains and that

1240
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:25,660
is a lot to do with when you're doing

1241
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,039
this like convoluted neural network or

1242
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,839
you're doing this back learning neural

1243
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,519
network whatever neural network you're

1244
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:32,049
using for a machine learning algorithm

1245
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,399
once it gets to the point of machine

1246
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:34,990
learning you're spending a lot of

1247
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,130
computing power just making candidates

1248
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,430
when you could have been spending that

1249
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,990
computing power trying candidates so for

1250
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,480
the Markov chain the tax that I've been

1251
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:47,618
doing I I am okay with a bunch of

1252
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,390
Afghanistan in the Honda Accord weekend

1253
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,529
today it's coming out of this even

1254
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,140
though that's almost guaranteed not

1255
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:55,809
going to be somebody's password it took

1256
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,058
me less than one nanosecond to come up

1257
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:59,319
with and it can immediately be just

1258
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,670
tossed in the pile with the rest of the

1259
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,308
candidates and one of the candidates

1260
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,559
won't be much better off and yes you can

1261
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:07,569
get the slides the slides are up on

1262
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:10,299
Schedule D or however you want to

1263
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:13,660
pronounce it schedule you can just tell

1264
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:19,119
just the schedule website skin

1265
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:24,240
I call it skin um let's see so one

1266
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:27,490
question GT X 1080 Ti or two atti I

1267
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,558
guess that's asking like but given the

1268
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,019
cost difference you know I'm sure 1080 T

1269
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,690
eyes are much cheaper than so eighty

1270
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:38,109
guys yeah I I cannot remember off the

1271
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:40,930
top of my head what those benchmarks are

1272
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:42,730
for a 1080 CI but I'm gonna guess almost

1273
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,649
immediately based on what I've seen the

1274
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,720
ebay prices for and personally taken

1275
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,160
advantage of the ebay prices for your

1276
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,078
tenet ET eyes are probably a lot easier

1277
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,000
to get ahold of and you can get them for

1278
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,589
around three to four hundred bucks easy

1279
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,319
there's a lot of crypto people still

1280
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:59,078
offloading them I need to bring them

1281
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,630
like yeah yeah you can absolutely slot

1282
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,700
these in even if you don't need a video

1283
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,869
Szalai to work for haps got to eat all

1284
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:10,629
of your GPU thank you

1285
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:12,400
so that's definitely an option okay yeah

1286
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,839
I think that person was just saying that

1287
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,549
they saw both on the sides and they

1288
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:18,460
weren't clear which one it was that you

1289
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:20,200
were using both yeah that's between

1290
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,930
corporate machines or personal machines

1291
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,368
is the answer for that one

1292
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:30,129
well sadly I do not have a twenty ATT

1293
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:33,319
item okay gotcha all right I think

1294
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,420
that's it for the for the questions

1295
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:39,019
you probably want to go check out the

1296
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,969
track one channel in the in the discord

1297
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:43,430
see if there's any that I'm I missed in

1298
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:47,269
there and there's a lot of good chat in

1299
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:49,328
there about about your talk very good

1300
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:53,589
stuff alright

1301
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:53,589
Thank You Travis thank you
