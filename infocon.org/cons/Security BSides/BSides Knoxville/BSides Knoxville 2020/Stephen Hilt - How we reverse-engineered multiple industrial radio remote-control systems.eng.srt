1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,350
ok everybody we're gonna get started

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,700
with Steven hill he's going to be going

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,410
over and that went backwards we're gonna

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,178
be talking with Steven Hilde here I'm

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,900
gonna make him presenter and we'll get

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,840
started go on webcam here for a minute

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,480
for you guys hi I'm Steven hilt and this

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,420
will be my talk about how we reversed

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,210
engineered multiple industrial radio

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,289
remote control systems this project

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,230
originally started in 2018 was presented

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,860
a couple times in 2019 and here we are

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,809
in 2020 the year of the virtual

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,559
conference and a bunch of other things

15
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,059
that are going on in our lives so I'm

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,349
gonna go away from the camera here for a

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,828
little bit so you can focus on my slides

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,940
and not this I'll be back for later and

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:59,609
answer some questions at the end if you

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:04,369
have any so this project originally

21
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,810
started in as I said in 2018

22
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:11,580
one of the things we were looking to do

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,790
is find some targets in which we wanted

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,740
to look at from a reverse engineering

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,979
stance and get really deep into some

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,408
wireless RF protocols and so one of the

27
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,619
things that we noticed is that when we

28
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,140
drove around to do this research and

29
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,689
things like that we found something

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,240
interesting that we kept seeing all over

31
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,070
the place from coworkers that were on

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,750
this project with me from you know

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,408
things you could see from your apartment

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:53,240
building - this is a shot I took in

35
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:55,680
Tokyo in December 2018 again this is

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,119
when they were ramping up for something

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,369
that was going to happen this year which

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,840
would be the the Olympics so one of the

39
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,659
things that I wanted to point out was

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,310
one of the things that we saw is as you

41
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,870
zoom in here

42
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,380
as you see all these things off in the

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,209
distance so we kept looking and looking

44
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,769
and you see a lot of careens all over

45
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:24,050
the place so one of the first things we

46
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,430
wanted to look at was cranes now there's

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,060
multiple types of cranes there's

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,670
overhead cranes there's the cranes that

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,650
we just showed you there's a bunch of

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,839
different things and one thing that's in

51
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,200
common with all of them is the way

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,370
they're controlled and this is a

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:47,600
controller specifically for an overhead

54
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,299
crane this is my coworker Marko it's

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,400
actually attached to here and there's

56
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:55,430
other types of something more simplified

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:01,819
but pretty much the way any of them work

58
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,400
is you push up the crane hoist up and

59
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,929
then there's down north south east and

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,760
west there's some other functions if

61
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,510
depending on but that's the primary

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,640
functions of all of these so we wanted

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,310
to look at before we started diving into

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,130
it where exactly are all these things

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,410
are they used where these types of

66
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,959
controllers used other than maybe just

67
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,709
cranes as well so first thing we'll see

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,579
is that much like the previous picture

69
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:36,980
industrial hoists they're used in mobile

70
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,239
hoists so the trucks that move around

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,310
and and pick things up as well

72
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:48,069
concrete pumps are using these these are

73
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:52,130
used in agriculture logistics forestry

74
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:54,768
drilling operations I saw a YouTube

75
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,959
video of a continuous miner that's being

76
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,239
ran by pretty much the exact same

77
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,430
controller I showed you that Marko was

78
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,420
wearing they're used in industrial

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:09,700
automation material mining pretty much

80
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:13,160
what we're saying is almost every sector

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,530
will eventually or has one of these so

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,600
this was a very good target for us

83
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,370
because it's not just super hyper

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,870
focused on say something like you know

85
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,790
just

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,250
moving material say in a steel mill or

87
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,699
anything like that so it's everything

88
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,580
from transportation and things like that

89
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:38,530
are using these so then we wanted to

90
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,810
look at say market share so where are

91
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,388
the vendors located things like that and

92
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,850
we found several large vendors based in

93
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,910
the highlighted countries most of these

94
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,830
vendors have been operating for decades

95
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,240
so it's a very mature business with tens

96
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,240
of millions of dollars in revenue

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,830
so how do they work

98
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:08,910
the transmitter communicates over

99
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:14,758
wireless to the receiver the receiver

100
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:17,580
then operates a relay which then runs a

101
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:23,130
motor it's pretty simple so that signal

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,039
is telling it to do a run a motor you

103
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,330
can then hook these up to as I said

104
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,550
anything else you want so by pressing

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,190
buttons you can automate various

106
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,970
equipment and by triggering a switch

107
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,190
turn on a motor and things like that one

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,919
of the first things we we did was get

109
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,090
our hardware that we were using we used

110
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:52,250
both ettus B 2 tins

111
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:58,830
blade RFS some DVD DVT dongles as well

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:02,130
to start looking at these systems we

113
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,979
started looking when we started looking

114
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,590
the first steps that we saw and that we

115
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,560
took was to see what we can do with any

116
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:14,669
decoding of any of the messages as you

117
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,180
can see here we looked at 430 3.7

118
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,180
megahertz

119
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:25,339
took the packet then replayed it at the

120
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:27,709
same 433 megahertz point seven megahertz

121
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,939
so what happened so on the left side

122
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:33,559
with the record we're literally

123
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:34,729
recording in Guinea radio at four

124
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,679
hundred and thirty three point seven

125
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,779
megahertz then we take what we recorded

126
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:46,609
and replay it so I'm going to show you a

127
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:49,249
little demo of what happened here so

128
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:53,300
this is one of the vendors juco as you

129
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:57,550
can see the basic operations of up-down

130
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,550
left-right things like that

131
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:06,258
and so in the background we're recording

132
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,259
it now we'll put the controller down

133
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:16,969
so we recorded it now let's go through

134
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:19,909
the next step which is so now with the

135
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,430
controller down and no one's touching it

136
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,080
and in fact we even took the battery out

137
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,910
of the controller as you can see on the

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:32,560
ground and it's operating the crane from

139
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,560
our recorded captures

140
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,819
one of the first things you see on is

141
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,430
the relay on the back all of them

142
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:48,490
lighting up this is the command that

143
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:52,150
starts the radio much like the one I

144
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,710
showed earlier with the crane here so

145
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,289
then we're just replaying the command

146
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,330
that includes the start up command so

147
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,460
earlier there's a start up sequence

148
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,818
before any of the buttons for safety

149
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,609
work so you can actually replay the

150
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:11,800
start starting sequence so everything

151
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,919
turns on so what happened is when we

152
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,759
replayed the message it worked so we

153
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,469
wanted to see then what happens if we

154
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,539
capture multiple messages to see if we

155
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:27,849
could capture any differences within the

156
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:31,270
packet so message one of up message two

157
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:34,360
of up message three message all the

158
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,630
messages were the same so every time we

159
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,610
recorded on JUCO the messages were all

160
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:44,470
at the same every time we're hitting the

161
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,660
UP button now one caveat on this in one

162
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,920
thing we learned through a couple

163
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,750
different vendors and I'll show another

164
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,640
one later is there's different methods

165
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:59,050
in which some of the vendors work on

166
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,990
this case some of them it will be when

167
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,579
the button is pushed it'll hold until

168
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,220
the button is released so it's one

169
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,260
signal that says up and then when you

170
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,329
release it's more or less stop sending

171
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:16,560
up some vendor some radios it's

172
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:24,189
continuous message than the entire time

173
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,839
the mess the button is pressed so one of

174
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,420
the things

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,590
did see there was okay record and replay

176
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,860
it works all our vendors that we tested

177
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,660
this worked on it's super easy super

178
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,960
cheap to use all you have to do is

179
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,850
record a message and replay that message

180
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,290
every one that we tested was vulnerable

181
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:49,590
to this um to show you it's not just in

182
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,380
a lab here's a real crane in which this

183
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:57,150
is working on you should see we hit the

184
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:59,970
stop button that was on the top of it

185
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:05,459
so that in theory turns off the relays

186
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,330
ins inside the receiver so then with our

187
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,400
blade ahrefs

188
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:14,910
we are sending a signal to start it up

189
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:19,020
and start moving the the crane and you

190
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,939
can see here it's it's a overhead crane

191
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,460
that's been and it's moving inside of a

192
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,560
facility that picks heavy things up and

193
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,960
move the interesting thing here of

194
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,089
course is that chain swinging you're

195
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,840
swinging around now what's the damage

196
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,750
here

197
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,630
not a whole lot until you get close to

198
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:44,370
those cars and things like that you

199
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:47,580
could do do things but just in general

200
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,160
it's pretty pretty on unfortunate that

201
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,570
it's that easy that you can just record

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:11:02,490
and replay a message I don't know if

203
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:06,090
anyone here has used urh but this is

204
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,130
your H or the universal radio hacker so

205
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,460
we took most of our of the items that we

206
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,400
had we put them into urh and this is

207
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,070
where you can see things as well where

208
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,520
we start looking into pre-recorded

209
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,680
commands up north down east okay so now

210
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,790
we know what command is north which ones

211
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,130
up down east so once we recorded them

212
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,260
and started separating them into that

213
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,820
now we have arbitrary commands it

214
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,370
doesn't have to be one that we record

215
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,960
the whole sequence we've then broke it

216
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:46,520
up and chunked it into what we knew each

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:49,830
thing was so for our radios this worked

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,040
for each and every other radio we came

219
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,490
across we have to do the same capture

220
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,230
for these replays to work so it's not

221
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:02,040
necessarily something that we really

222
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,350
want to do where we record it for every

223
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,969
case what we want to eventually go to is

224
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:12,480
the ability to change because they have

225
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:16,770
a some of the vendors there's a pairing

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
ID that you have and so we wanted to

227
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,480
kind of reverse how that pairing ID

228
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,120
worked and other things like that so we

229
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,550
could figure out if we could do ours are

230
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,510
arbitrary command execution where it

231
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:33,260
didn't matter which device we had

232
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:37,310
we can always figure out how to to

233
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,350
interface with it and operate it so

234
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,599
we'll go back to our

235
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,700
juco in this case and let's look at this

236
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,710
vendor where we did a bunch of reversing

237
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,830
so one of the first things we did was

238
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:52,760
open up the case and the first thing you

239
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,860
see is a bunch of realize when we looked

240
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,939
a little further you see that underneath

241
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:06,500
the chip itself it's a CC 1120 chip with

242
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:08,900
an antenna out RF analysis so pretty

243
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:14,750
much what we have looking at the signal

244
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:17,180
coming out on on the chip itself so we

245
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:22,730
capture the signal now what so then we

246
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:24,229
captured the signal and then we decided

247
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,940
that we were gonna hook it up to a logic

248
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,860
analyzer to try to clean up some of that

249
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,800
noise

250
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:35,990
so we specifically used a tool to

251
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:39,469
emulate spy operations with a read and

252
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,560
write registers so we created a tool

253
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,620
that emulates the spy we actually did a

254
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:51,099
talk pretty exclusively on this tool

255
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:54,160
that we built we gave it a s 4 by 19 and

256
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,930
in Miami so if you want to see that talk

257
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,730
there's a lot better information there

258
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,260
hurt her on this research Jonathan

259
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,530
Anderson does a way better job of

260
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:10,069
explaining this tool than I ever could

261
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,990
mostly because he wrote it it's so go

262
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,280
watch that talk if you're really

263
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,320
interested in I could put you in touch

264
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,310
with Jonathan as well if you have any

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,100
questions about it but we can see here

266
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:27,500
is what's being accessed set and

267
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:30,220
programmed out with the tool that we

268
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,430
wrote from there we can

269
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,630
right custom New Guinea radio blocks

270
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:39,699
based on the information that we saw in

271
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:43,540
the spine so here's a an example of us

272
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,590
exercising those complex protocols these

273
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,589
complex protocols

274
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,040
are

275
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:57,840
based off the information that we

276
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:03,219
decoded from the radios so you see

277
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:05,220
things like the preamble syncwords

278
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,600
address at all those things that we

279
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,160
decoded out of it so then we ended up

280
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,100
coming up with this complicated you know

281
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,719
radio flow graph that would be that

282
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,620
would be able to do everything we needed

283
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,620
to do in JUCO

284
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:30,850
then we dug into the specs and then we

285
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:33,790
found the frame of the CC 11:20 based on

286
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,290
the specs here for the data field so

287
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:40,420
we're going to try to reverse out what

288
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:42,459
is actually in the data field so we

289
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,400
started we knew the preamble syncwords

290
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,110
trailers but what's in the data so

291
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,720
there's a custom application protocol

292
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:54,160
with security through obscurity baked

293
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:57,250
and usually so we have a preamble sync

294
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,800
or word and then the custom application

295
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:03,640
so when we started looking at the data

296
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,579
you see we have first thing as a

297
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,630
sequential ID so after the preamble in

298
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,630
syncwords that we have

299
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:18,899
sequential ad we were able to get the

300
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:21,750
system to send sorry we were able to get

301
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:24,540
the system to send with fixed sequential

302
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:28,500
I deities to see what anything else had

303
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,420
was uh anything else changed or didn't

304
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,720
change so then the next thing we noticed

305
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,800
is these interesting five bytes and it's

306
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,930
a type of sorry those five bytes seemed

307
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,060
interesting to us why did they seem

308
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:47,010
interesting to us it was the ID number

309
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:50,239
on the model itself or on on the sticker

310
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,240
inside the case

311
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,089
you

312
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,569
so then we looked back at the board

313
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,219
remember there was the ID and we kept

314
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,959
hitting our head on the desk this

315
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,529
actually happened at a team meeting when

316
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,158
we were in our offices in Taipei one day

317
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:10,769
to figure it out that if we just took

318
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:16,470
the pairing code which can be changed

319
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:19,480
via a USB from what the pairing code

320
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,329
which would be the ID

321
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,299
and then we changed that pairing code to

322
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,659
the new pairing code to nothing but

323
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,660
zeros

324
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,149
then we come out with the pairing code

325
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:40,120
actually tends to be so what happened

326
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:41,678
here was the long story short is we XOR

327
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,949
the data with the pairing code of all

328
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,769
zeros with our original data set and we

329
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,929
found we would get the following which

330
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:52,630
is our pairing code in little-endian so

331
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,019
now we know what those five bytes have

332
00:17:52,630 --> 00:18:02,309
in the pairing code are the next is the

333
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:05,799
command and you can see it's things like

334
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:07,510
pretty basic information in there so now

335
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,179
we have command injection not just for

336
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,340
our radios but with some basic lookups

337
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,200
and we created a lookup table so we

338
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,230
could pretty much sniff one packet

339
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,850
lookup what you're pairing code is now I

340
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,549
can communicate to you

341
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,639
I'll regenerate the packets things like

342
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:29,350
that and then send them out so this come

343
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:36,668
up for any any juco radio that we we

344
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:39,158
found so comes up the

345
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:43,960
this is what the protocol looks like for

346
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:48,119
up command so pretty much anything you

347
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:52,359
want to do we can do of any commands

348
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,279
including an e stop button command so

349
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:59,470
the idea here is that we can take any

350
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:02,350
command that you give us that I see as I

351
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:08,619
can then change the command to whatever

352
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:11,619
the command I want it to be and when we

353
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:15,309
send a bunch of Aesop's more or less

354
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:19,389
your crane just stops working so what if

355
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,609
we do that in a loop do we have a do we

356
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:25,508
actually have a dose of a production or

357
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:29,340
whatever so next one is a little video

358
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,340
that we have of us actually doing that

359
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:46,720
so with the the systems running now and

360
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:51,740
then you can see doesn't work my weights

361
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:54,200
and it does work there now it's off so

362
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,980
it's just every time you start it it

363
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,830
stops

364
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,929
we just continually run that script and

365
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,990
it will always it's just constantly

366
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:06,590
telling the JUCO radio that in that case

367
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,559
to stop so now we have command injection

368
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,439
so we have re-record and replays command

369
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,510
injections a couple other things we want

370
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,010
to work on which was the e stop abuse

371
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:21,799
and then malicious repairing so

372
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,950
malicious repairing is interesting so

373
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:30,100
the idea here is that we could see if we

374
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:35,299
could reprogram another controller

375
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,949
instead of walking around with all our

376
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,080
SDR equipment can you buy one of these

377
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,830
controllers then reprogram your

378
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:46,460
controller to work with that system and

379
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:49,100
so we looked at one of the our other

380
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,850
radios but we were working with which

381
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,668
was a saga radio in this case to see if

382
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,320
we could do anything with the firmware

383
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:00,320
anything like that as well so this is

384
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,480
the USB programming tool that we got and

385
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,639
we looked at the schematics and we found

386
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,769
lots of issues once we started looking

387
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:13,879
at this not only did saga have these

388
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:18,110
ports for reprogramming the transmitter

389
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,299
but most of them did not just saga so

390
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,070
we're not talking just a saga thing we

391
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,860
are able to find clear text passwords

392
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:28,689
and transmission the firmware was

393
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,209
unprotected and we also could Forge the

394
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,340
integrity checks which could lead to

395
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,549
backdoors on these devices in short

396
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,080
Melissa malicious repairing worked and

397
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:42,220
we could put rogue refer more on these

398
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,220
on some devices

399
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:51,959
so with that we have now I'm sorry wrong

400
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:54,000
we have our maliciously preparing

401
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,920
reprogramming the malicious

402
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,230
reprogramming and repairing are a little

403
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,320
more on our expensive side in our cases

404
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,540
just because it takes a little bit a

405
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,139
little extra time and a little extra

406
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:12,370
effort but is possible from all the

407
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,710
devices that we tested so next we're

408
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,850
going to look at possibly how can we do

409
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:21,790
remote stealthy and persistent attacks

410
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:25,480
so here we have a tool that we built

411
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:27,820
custom wise called RF quack you can go

412
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,410
to github.com slash Trend Micro / RF

413
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,780
quick and find all the information you

414
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:35,140
want about it we've actually done a

415
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,860
little bit more work on this this tool

416
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:42,130
set since then but the idea here is we

417
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:47,169
have a remote attacker through a 4G LTE

418
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:51,640
connection then can transmit and

419
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:54,480
communicate to you this in total the

420
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,090
cost to build one of these is around $40

421
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,460
and here's a little video that we put

422
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,459
together about how it operates

423
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,500
you

424
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,220
yeah and we made it flexible so you can

425
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,230
actually use this not just for crane

426
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,110
controllers but any any project you're

427
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,480
working on one of the things that we

428
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,610
were having issues with in some of the

429
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,330
cases with some of the original tool

430
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,419
sets that we're trying to use that just

431
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,610
didn't work like we wanted him to and

432
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,230
you know I reached out to Travis

433
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,250
Goodspeed a couple times about some

434
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,590
projects and also Atlas for some of his

435
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,030
things as well that we just couldn't

436
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:54,360
really get working we actually ended up

437
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:56,070
patching the are the you know you got a

438
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,919
couple tool sets to see if we could get

439
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:02,149
them to work for us but that didn't seem

440
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,340
to work very much that's a really good

441
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:12,110
sorry about that video artifact then we

442
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,110
toss it okay

443
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,429
flickering for you guys or no

444
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,150
yeah it seems to be a little slow videos

445
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:33,600
don't do too well across good webinar

446
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,850
I'll post all these slides to sketch

447
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,600
these so you guys can watch the videos

448
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,520
if you want long story short by example

449
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,209
we were able to exploit vulnerabilities

450
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,820
that we found remotely so now we can

451
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,669
sniff everything we wanted to sniff we

452
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,649
could even then transmit what we wanted

453
00:24:50,669 --> 00:25:02,130
to transmit on something that is

454
00:24:52,650 --> 00:25:03,690
relatively small so well I'll just go

455
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:09,000
ahead and skip this slide because it's

456
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:12,779
not doing so doing so hot so in other

457
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,549
words we have a flexible tool that can

458
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,100
do a lot lots of things that you want it

459
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:19,289
to do is just some see you know

460
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,178
rewriting some code here and there for

461
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,679
it so if you're interested in that check

462
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,409
it out if you have any questions let me

463
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,740
know about that tool set so earlier I

464
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:31,470
mentioned Travis sure Travis probably

465
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,049
actually might be on this call because I

466
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:37,880
got a give him big shout out for one of

467
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,539
the big successes of this project so and

468
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,830
besides

469
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:48,658
Knoxville 2018

470
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:51,389
Travis gave a really good talk on his

471
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,159
good watch and so when I was doing this

472
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:58,670
project I was sitting there thinking I

473
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:05,270
was to myself is it possible for us

474
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:09,200
to take a good watch reap and control

475
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:11,090
one of the cranes that we had in essence

476
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:20,110
I'm going to show you the video from me

477
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:26,780
in 2000 at s4 in 2019 here

478
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:29,929
controlling the crane itself here so

479
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,120
this is online and I'll post the slides

480
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,480
as well so you should be able to see

481
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,239
that if not as you can see here here's

482
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,300
the good watch controlling our saga

483
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:46,940
crane it's going up and down and things

484
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:51,159
like that so we were able to control the

485
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:55,910
crane from from the watch which is

486
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:58,040
pretty pretty good achievement there

487
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,710
because one of the things I was always

488
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,379
joking around if we can do that yeah the

489
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,840
RF quake is really good we can run it on

490
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,150
a battery and you can drop it you don't

491
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,010
have to be near but how many times are

492
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,640
you stopping somebody coming into any of

493
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:19,370
your facilities for wearing a watch you

494
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:23,420
doubt so if I I as a an attacker figure

495
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,919
out how to you know monitor view and get

496
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,420
all that information and then can

497
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,190
program a watch and then come into your

498
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,710
facility and do something you're never

499
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,630
gonna question the guy with the watch

500
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,300
that was my approach on it and so far

501
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,200
that's pretty good that I've never got

502
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:42,350
anything that says anybody is really

503
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:49,930
questioning people with watches so from

504
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,929
a disclosure stance we had

505
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,379
only one vendor released a patch we're

506
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,530
not going to go back and police them and

507
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,280
check the patch but one out of seven is

508
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:07,310
pretty sad one vendor we spoke with in

509
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,490
person said that nobody would it would

510
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,560
ever be able to do these attacks another

511
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:17,690
vendor approached us and thanked us for

512
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:22,550
our paper because that they were also

513
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,560
able to go to talk at din if you want it

514
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,770
which is a working group that he's part

515
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:33,740
of in order to amend existing safety

516
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:36,770
standards specifically IEC 62 745 which

517
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,200
is the standard for minimal requirements

518
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:42,320
for functional safety for remote

519
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,600
controls the amendment that he wanted to

520
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,450
suggest is including requirements that

521
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,969
state standard compliance devices should

522
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,630
at least not be affected by simple

523
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,760
replay attacks one vendor in particular

524
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,510
you threatened legal action against us

525
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,550
for having looked at their devices but

526
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:05,210
now have decided with much discussions

527
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:08,030
from zdi which Trend Micro zdi is part

528
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:12,770
of so we have to go through zdi for our

529
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:16,210
disclosures with so with much discussion

530
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,830
with the CDI they have decided to patch

531
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,280
but we haven't seen public evidence of

532
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:25,610
this patch overall the process was

533
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,830
painful which took 30 days more than our

534
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:31,790
usual 90-day disclosure window so we

535
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:34,570
gave them extra time I'd say it went

536
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:37,790
worse than typical ICS face

537
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:41,330
vulnerability disclosure because in at

538
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:45,620
least in ICS space we understand some of

539
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:50,179
it they understand take it when we were

540
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,610
talking to these people it's like 2006

541
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,070
when we were originally talking to some

542
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,469
of the ICS vendors and we got a question

543
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,149
from one vendor even which was Oh Valle

544
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,580
'nor ability what does that mean help us

545
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,110
understand it you found a vulnerability

546
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,949
I we don't even know what a

547
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,949
vulnerability is

548
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:14,120
so that was fairly interesting right in

549
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,679
our paper so going back to the vendor

550
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,959
that said no one will be over to do this

551
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,310
so it's kind of we I figured this was

552
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,980
going to come from some of the vendors

553
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:26,629
and so what I was able to do at one

554
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:28,880
point in time was you know I'm down here

555
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,150
in Chattanooga and there's a lot of

556
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,260
industry around us so I was able to

557
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:39,290
completely profile a company um online

558
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,510
from my house get all the information I

559
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,570
needed I actually ended up watching

560
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,690
their crane safety training videos that

561
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:50,000
they had posted to YouTube which showed

562
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,280
me exactly what you vendor they they had

563
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,240
then I went to that vendor and looked up

564
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,620
the model that they had and found that

565
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,630
the operating range in which the

566
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,290
frequencies that they were working from

567
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,330
or I then went and sat in a public park

568
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,940
near the facility that they were at with

569
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,860
a directional antenna and was able to

570
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:15,490
pull signal for them operating the crane

571
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:18,770
I cover this a little in the paper

572
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:21,950
itself as well as other presentations

573
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:23,870
I've talked about that before but that

574
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,170
was actually part of the evidence that

575
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,899
we showed them when they said no one's

576
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,910
going to be able to do these tax was

577
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,450
here's me sniffing figuring out exactly

578
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:39,020
which protocol it was and yeah it took

579
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:43,750
something like a vendor or an asset

580
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:47,450
owner to put their information

581
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:50,870
specifically on the Internet as in their

582
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,940
training safety videos but we can glean

583
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:56,000
a lot of information from a lot of other

584
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,800
places as well but the point being is we

585
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,540
can actually do this and I can we and as

586
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,070
we've shown in other videos that I've

587
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,629
shown you with the actual cranes

588
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,540
operating this wasn't just lab

589
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,270
environment stuff we were able to with

590
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:14,060
permission control actual cranes

591
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:16,400
hooked up to actual things and the only

592
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,460
thing that's different between the one

593
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,529
that I even showed with the watch versus

594
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,529
big crane is what the motor that it's

595
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:27,080
hooked to is what these are all the same

596
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:33,020
things that you can buy and do from

597
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,960
there so from a vendor stance if you are

598
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,639
a crane vendor you need to use open

599
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,169
technologies standards such as Bluetooth

600
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,730
we need to adopt rollin codes and

601
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:51,110
encryption and protect the firmware and

602
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:53,029
use it in user maintenance is in because

603
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,520
a lot of these things that the users

604
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,590
can't even maintain it you have to get

605
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,889
it the vendor to come in and fix some of

606
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:04,070
these issues because they don't really

607
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:06,380
give tool sets to update something

608
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,379
that's not even actually on a connected

609
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,299
to the network so that's just something

610
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,830
you know they have to come in with their

611
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:18,260
tool sets in and upgrade them from users

612
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,418
we need to promote vendors to open

613
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,270
adopting open technologies and we need

614
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:26,179
to do better maintenance and update

615
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:29,690
periods and periods of change of the

616
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:32,240
secret pairing codes and pairing IDs as

617
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,789
an example for JUCO you could change it

618
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,529
the ID was just the hard set one that

619
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:39,289
was there but you need to if you buy a

620
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:43,039
new controller you needed to pair it

621
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:47,270
with the receiver so they give you the

622
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,000
USB tool to do this then will they sell

623
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,908
it to you and their software suite they

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,919
sell it to you but there is those

625
00:33:52,909 --> 00:34:00,919
options that happens in some cases for

626
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,330
some of the radios you just you have to

627
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,149
so for saga you had to buy from saga new

628
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,830
crystals that match the right frequency

629
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:13,940
in the case of some vendors there was

630
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,409
just dip switches on the receiver and

631
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,540
transmitter so you just had to make the

632
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:24,619
dip switches match to which frequency or

633
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:26,330
on so in conclusion patterns of

634
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,300
vulnerabilities there is no rolling

635
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,810
codes one of my co-workers federico was

636
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,820
still

637
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,190
I remember when we found the first one

638
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:42,520
that we could replay guys like my garage

639
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:46,520
door has more security than these cranes

640
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,710
or even your car you know they're the

641
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,790
we've worked out some of the security

642
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:54,379
issues basic ones that at least help for

643
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,750
a little bit with a little bit of the

644
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:04,400
replays so there's weak or no encryption

645
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:06,830
at all by week we meant that XOR that's

646
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,660
about as much encryption as we saw and

647
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,810
that's not really encryption that's

648
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:15,259
encoding the lack of software and

649
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:19,310
firmware protections and the companies

650
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:22,910
need security programs and awareness for

651
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:25,430
this field specifically well as I said

652
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:29,029
we released a white paper on this you

653
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:33,560
can go to that URL or ping me later

654
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:36,490
about it can I'll probably add it to

655
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:40,759
schedule D as well with my presentation

656
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:45,069
so there's that at that point in time

657
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,070
just if you have any other questions so

658
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,410
we don't have any questions post it

659
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,479
through GoToWebinar but I do want to

660
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:56,830
point out that there was some jealousy

661
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,690
thrown your way and track two on discord

662
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:02,900
they want to be able to play with big RC

663
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:06,430
cars too yeah yeah yeah that that's

664
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,140
pretty much what this was we can control

665
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:15,529
anything and everything with one let me

666
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:16,060
turn the camera back on yeah I'm sorry

667
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,090
about the

668
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:22,860
is not working as well as as as they

669
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:26,020
could have so as I said I'll post those

670
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,120
for anyone winning wanting to build a

671
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,120
good watch that does one of these things

672
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,220
you can there's been all actually

673
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:37,480
several follow-on researchers that have

674
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,759
taken over the course of a couple of the

675
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,240
course of last year and up to today that

676
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,690
they've looked at more vendors specific

677
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,979
to their own regions and countries and I

678
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:54,820
have pretty much found the same things

679
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:58,930
some of the bigger ones vendors already

680
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:01,450
have used some security there's a couple

681
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:04,839
vendors that have Bluetooth based cranes

682
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,370
you know that that implies its own

683
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,000
problems but at least they're on a

684
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:15,089
standard protocol for most of what we

685
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:19,180
saw is all the sub gigahertz things were

686
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:22,570
roll-your-own Radio chips that they just

687
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,930
kind of built on and and you know wrote

688
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,460
their own protocols for control when

689
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:32,140
we're looking at the vendors themselves

690
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:36,460
a lot of smaller vendors are

691
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,859
rebranding larger vendors equipment so

692
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,500
while saga doesn't sound good the big

693
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:44,320
because there in Taiwan they're

694
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:50,170
rebranded throughout the US as three

695
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,030
different other brands and we once you

696
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,980
start tearing them apart you start

697
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:57,390
seeing that they're all some of them

698
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:04,630
they're they're using a lot of the same

699
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:07,810
equipment same same things and it's it's

700
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:11,470
led on to some other research that we

701
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:16,150
were looking at doing and as well as

702
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:22,270
we're finding what other controllers use

703
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:28,150
these same types of basic communications

704
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:28,660
over RF to control other things as I

705
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,839
said the

706
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,190
the continuous miner was fun it looks

707
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,288
really dangerous but you really also

708
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,119
have to think about that things probably

709
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,799
about a mile on the ground and the

710
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,140
ability to control it's probably really

711
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:47,619
really hard so that that's not really

712
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,578
feasible to make a continuous miner in a

713
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,839
cup in a coal mine

714
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:56,230
go crazy I just have a question come

715
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:57,788
through discord Sam wants to know what

716
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:03,039
are some of the more interesting failure

717
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:04,809
modes like dropping a container so we

718
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,549
can't actually be one of those I've had

719
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:10,150
a question once where somebody asked me

720
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:13,230
is has this ever happened and we don't

721
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:16,770
know but one of the biggest failures

722
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:21,160
that I know about from a crane stance

723
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:23,770
would be there was a and it's public

724
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,680
because I happened at a nuclear plant in

725
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:29,440
Arkansas where they were doing some

726
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,069
outage work and they ended up dropping

727
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:37,480
the content reactor vessel lid back on

728
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:40,509
the reactor which damaged it to where

729
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,480
that plant had to be out for for a while

730
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:48,579
there's a NRC report about the write-up

731
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:52,799
about the cranes failure so yeah you

732
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:57,010
could if it is something that is got a

733
00:39:52,799 --> 00:40:01,270
ability to grab and drop you could drop

734
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:04,029
it or you the problem is that a lot of

735
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:07,900
these systems already have controls in

736
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:10,119
case a motor breaks there's they they

737
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,960
have brakes on them they're meant to

738
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:18,039
stop and not fall but if we get into and

739
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,640
you have other conditions or the perfect

740
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:25,480
storm type of situation we could you

741
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:29,970
could cause some big problems there's

742
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:33,609
you mean even think about if you were a

743
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:35,200
partner or sorry you had a you were

744
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:36,910
building a building and somebody else

745
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,609
was building a building next to you and

746
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:42,529
you were arrival for whatever and you

747
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:45,650
were able to make their crane

748
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:52,520
more or less stop that could cause a

749
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:56,710
problem or you know other things in

750
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,810
general just on supply chain the one

751
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:03,560
we've seen these things literally all

752
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:10,549
over the place including offshore oil

753
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:16,790
rigs is just the tow trucks actually use

754
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:18,530
the same technology to lift heavier rigs

755
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,720
because you can't be standing there

756
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:23,680
while you're tipping like a big semi

757
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,959
back so that you'll notice that they're

758
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,890
wirelessly off somewhere on some of the

759
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,620
newer ones those are the exact same

760
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:36,529
systems that we're discussing I actually

761
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:39,109
have a video of a mobile oyster that

762
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:41,750
we're operating at some point in time

763
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:47,090
it's in that video that didn't play very

764
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:49,130
well great and one more comment we have

765
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:53,210
Lisa who wanted you to know that that

766
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,700
was a fantastic talk and thank you for

767
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:58,580
giving it do want to let everybody know

768
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,500
that after the conference there will be

769
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,930
a survey sent out to all the attendees

770
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,510
you could rate people's talks give

771
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,660
comments we also have a discussion going

772
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:11,230
on in discord a couple of CTFs going on

773
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,609
and we're gonna take a short break

774
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,140
thanks Steven yeah if you have any

775
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,030
questions ping me on discord I'll get

776
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,359
the presentation up to schedule a here

777
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:22,400
in just a few minutes and you know I'm

778
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,010
around all day so if you have any

779
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,670
questions ping me again thanks to Travis

780
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,670
for all the help
