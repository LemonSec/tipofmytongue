61
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,950
anybody cares about right now there'll

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,080

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:56,110
little bit offline so so don't make too

65
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:59,100
why talk on this topic well there's many

66
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,100
different reasons I guess

67
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,149
if you're going out watching conference

68
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,780
videos going attending conferences all

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,420
that you're gonna see the navigable

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,489
intro to ascent or how to perform a

71
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,349
Centauro scent for red teamers stuff

72
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,900
like that at almost every conference

73
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,480
I've given a few those myself honestly

74
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,819
and there's also entire conferences like

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,119
later 8 that is more or less dedicated

76
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:29,078
to social engineering ascent things of

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,790
that nature there's a other little side

78
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,859
talks that are given at a lot of

79
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,200
conferences for an docent tract somebody

80
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:38,109
there's always a lot of that there's not

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,810
as many on the same safe staying

82
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,359
anonymous online but that's not to say

83
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,530
they're not out there the ones I have

84
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,799
seen that are out there

85
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,540
typically balance around the concept of

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,439
you're a red teamer how do you build out

87
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,870
a profile so you can use it to do your

88
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,840
social engineering do your exploitation

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,419
or it might just be a southern long

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,510
deadline or another aspect of the ascent

91
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:06,909
anti ascent or online security talks

92
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,260
I've seen have been the yep time to

93
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,150
become a hermit living out in the middle

94
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,720
of the Yukon somewhere here's how you

95
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,340
cut all ties to everything I didn't want

96
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,668
to do either one of those because that's

97
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:22,060
not what I've seen Muslim like my family

98
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:25,060
and I talked to they need it's usually

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,289
this concept that well how do I make

100
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,530
sure that people don't steal my identity

101
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:33,400
or how do I make sure that people don't

102
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,469
I guess who I guess what my bank account

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,539
number is and jump into any number of

104
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,669
things like that or take over my

105
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,880
Facebook your page and all that so how

106
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:46,030
do you go about being safe online how do

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,219
you go on separating yourself from your

108
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,570
internet identity and that's why I

109
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,919
wanted to give this talk is because I

110
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,599
don't really see too many of those out

111
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,000
there I'm sure there are something out

112
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:58,300
there and I give links to other talks at

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,570
the end but they cover other aspects of

114
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:05,740
this entire world of online security and

115
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:09,610
taiyo set so for those of you who might

116
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,770
be new to oh said or what have you I

117
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,139
wanted to throw in a quick little one

118
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,020
slide on what is

119
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,629
a super short version of this it stands

120
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,219
for open source intelligence there's

121
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,289
tons of different definitions out there

122
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,599
but they all boil down to basically the

123
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,759
same concept of it is the collection and

124
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:30,599
analysis of data obtained from publicly

125
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,509
accessible sources and that covers most

126
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,460
use deserve a set up there why does

127
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,990
somebody want to perform a set well they

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,248
want to find information about someone

129
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,710
something that they're not willing to

130
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:48,060
give up themselves well you can do this

131
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,500
because in a modern age we tend to put

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,090
lots and lots of information about

133
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,810
ourselves about what we do about

134
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,698
everything we work with online social

135
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,800
media everybody has a social media

136
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,930
account out there almost you're

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,180
preparing for grandparent your cousin's

138
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,449
your nieces nephews everybody wants to

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,919
have a Facebook page a tik-tok account

140
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,210
or whatever the case is they want to

141
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,549
have that out there so many people

142
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,650
wanting to do YouTube blogs and all that

143
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,719
so people are just flooding the internet

144
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,000
with information about themselves you

145
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:20,219
when you wanna go to those you usually

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,770
set up a profile you put in what your

147
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:26,339
name is but what other accounts do you

148
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,438
have what's your full name when were you

149
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,240

166
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,960
glean information from data leaks from

167
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,279
going after a company I might look at

168
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,529
what's been uploaded to paceman or

169
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,539
paceman like sites on data leaks looking

170
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:16,199
for passwords going through document

171
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:18,438
metadata looking for user names the list

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,089
just goes on and on and on there's a

173
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,300
criminal history lookups you can look up

174
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:26,099
on people there's a who owns what

175
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,140
property how much they pay for their

176
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,110
taxes

177
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,830
all of this stuff is online in most

178
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,300
states and most cities counties they do

179
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:40,460
it for free just to put it out there

180
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,810
because it's open information now some

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,450
of that you can do something about it's

182
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,920
time you can't but so but the thing is

183
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,870
there's all this information about you

184
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,310
out there and people can do stuff with

185
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:56,690
it well we've talked about OSHA what is

186
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:59,360
anti Oh cent or online security whatever

187
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,150
you want to refer to it as well in short

188
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
as a says there I came up with this

189
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,330
little one or I might have been

190
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,700
influenced by some article I read I

191
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,070
don't know but regardless the little

192
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,710
quote I'm going with here is in short it

193
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,960
is the process which by which someone or

194
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,080
one attempts to prevent the gathering of

195
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,580
accurate upset about a person or thing

196
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,419
we'll come back to that accurate part in

197
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,150
a moment but when I I render this whole

198
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,440
concept by my family and all that just

199
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,210
to see what they thought about me doing

200
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,870
a talk about this and one of the things

201
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,240
as well

202
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,400
why are you concerned about it don't you

203
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,229
have anything to hide and all this and

204
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,150
they're like well let the stuff that

205
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,650
that sounds if you're gonna go into the

206
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,260
realm of doing all this stuff that

207
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,959
you're talking about in the let the

208
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,819
stuff like what spies do or those are

209
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,440
like the Unabomber and Hermits we live

210
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,570
off the grid somewhere or conspiracy

211
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,120
theorist all that stuff I'm like well

212
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,610
true those kind of individuals or

213
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,330
organizations do this kind of anti Oh

214
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,520
set obviously in many time it's in many

215
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,670
cases but it's not just for them it's

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,900
for a lot of other people too doesn't

217
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,589
matter who you are or where you come

218
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,290
from there's gonna be some reason well

219
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,160
then again why is online privacy

220
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,250
important

221
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,540
well there's any number of reasons you

222
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,270
can read through these I'll touch on

223
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,149
some of them but for example if you're

224
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,879
gonna go and apply for a new job

225
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:28,569
odds are that the someone on that

226
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,129
decision board on that interview board

227
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:32,628
hire you board whatever just want to do

228
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,459
a little bit of Oh set against you

229
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:38,569
they're gonna go out online see if they

230
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:40,579
can find have you done anything coding

231
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:44,740
waz and uploaded it to github have you

232
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,979
done any videos on YouTube can they find

233
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,920
excuse me

234
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,930
references to you on various conference

235
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,569
sites but in the process they're also

236
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,638
gonna look for social media accounts and

237
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:57,319
things of that nature this is probably

238
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,749
before they've ever even met you they've

239
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:00,889
just got your resume and the reading are

240
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:04,279
in there you want to go out and look

241
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:08,540
about you so this is helping build their

242
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,800
first impression of you maybe they find

243
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,230
something in there of you doing

244
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,660
questionable activities or you've posted

245
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,370
some questionable photos so I'm not

246
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,920
saying that any decision they make

247
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,050
should be based on what they see but we

248
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,670
are humans this is what you're

249
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,248
presenting to the world as your first

250
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,300
impression to many people so it is going

251
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:34,819
to possibly bias what they think of you

252
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:36,800
also a lot of companies when we get into

253
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:38,929
this in a moment but they do monitor

254
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,149
your and your social media account my

255
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:44,449
wife was a teacher for a number of years

256
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,069
and when she signed on there she had to

257
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,469
agree that they are gonna monitor

258
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:50,209
there's her social media account to make

259
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,610
sure that everything that she's

260
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,179
supposedly out there reflect reflect

261
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,439
properly back on the school district

262
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:00,889
personally I don't agree with that but

263
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:05,599
that is what they're the requirement

264
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:09,230
their rule was so in that point privacy

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,870
is very important what else is there Oh

266
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,089
companies in general if you're signed up

267
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,699
for a free surface I service or if

268
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,589
you're signed up for a free an email

269
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:22,189
account or using something that is

270
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,439
you're not paying for well hate to break

271
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,779
it to you but very very few those things

272
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:28,819
are truly free what you're paying with

273
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:31,129
is your information your browsing habits

274
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:34,128
your purchasing habits your search

275
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,199
habits they're presenting you with ads

276
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,740
that you may or may not click on which

277
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,719
gives

278
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,700
some revenue back all kind of

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,860
information like that you are the

280
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,920
product at that point Wow

281
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,890
they might even do it for royalty

282
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,510
accounts like if you go to your local

283
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,090
big chain grocery store you're probably

284
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,250
gonna get a little get an offer for a

285
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,800
loyalty card well if you use that

286
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,790
loyalty card you get discounts well well

287
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,680
they're doing is they're taking that

288
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,599
purchasing information information you

289
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,359
provide on the application as well as

290
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,130
who and point on but what you bout there

291
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,890
and they're gonna use that for market

292
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,210
research for targeted advertising this

293
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,920
toward you they might even sell that

294
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,150
data to someone else that's going to

295
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,670
aggregate it with other made and I

296
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,350
helped build a better profile of the

297
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,150
people who buy a certain product or the

298
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,490
people who shop in a certain chain of

299
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:26,600
stores or even possibly about you

300
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,310
personally so if you don't want to be

301
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,770
profiled in that way or have that kind

302
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:35,119
of information try to avoid that kind of

303
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,490
interaction that don't sign up for the

304
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,680
loyalty cards if you don't want to or do

305
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,880
what we talk about later and sign up for

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,599
it under a different name

307
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,170
therefore it's getting information

308
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,060
they're still getting their information

309
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,180
but it's not directly tied back to you

310
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,719
things of that nature also just from a

311
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,579
pentesters perspective when we do social

312
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,890
engineering attacks one thing that we do

313
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,600
is we go out and search for people who

314
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,699
work for certain companies because like

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,280
Facebook will ask you who do you work

316
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,290
for there's other social media accounts

317
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,880
that allow for this tube and then you

318
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,219
get search for show me everybody who

319
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,689
works for this certain company LinkedIn

320
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,130
is great for that as well they're not

321
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,160
gonna build it a list of names of people

322
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,540
who work there and then target them for

323
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,640
phishing exercises stuff like that

324
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,610
this is all of purely oh said things

325
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,770
that we can gather from online and all

326
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,570
these things aren't some of them are not

327
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,750
always bad some of them are not always

328
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,820
good but it's all using information that

329
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,660
you're providing to the world also

330
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,770
criminals can use it for identity theft

331
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,199
setting up accounts in your name buying

332
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,660
stuff in your name doing illegal things

333
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,420
in your name if they can steal your

334
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:49,040
identity through this let's go ahead and

335
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,360
move on well do you need online privacy

336
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,430
short answer

337
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,399
yes everybody needs to be aware of their

338
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,420
online footprint their information

339
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,610
they're providing out there the kind of

340
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,649
privacy that they're giving up in many

341
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,180
times because everybody has something

342
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,800
they want to hide or they want to

343
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,199
obscure some of the things I've already

344
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,000
talked about others are sensitive data

345
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,610
like your financials your social

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,870
security number date of birth mother's

347
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,570
maiden name I think that could be

348
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,970
possible used to steal your identity

349
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,310
doing pen test doing online Oh said all

350
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,560
that I've come across any number of

351
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,599
documents people have posted or shared

352
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,550
out that have this information in it

353
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,040
just post it to the world out there not

354
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,019
obscure not restricted either they don't

355
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,880
know it or they don't care but either

356
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,279
way this is critical information about

357
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,100
who you are how you recommend you

358
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,939
protect that as I said before memorials

359
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,240
might try to monitor your online

360
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,010
presence if you've done some

361
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,500
questionable things in your past that

362
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,200
you're not a very keen of people knowing

363
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,880
anymore maybe you don't want to have

364
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,760
that posted out there maybe you

365
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,430
shouldn't well for example when the some

366
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,110
of the news I saw not too long ago if

367
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,209
you go and rob a bank or robbed an

368
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,880
armored car maybe you don't want to post

369
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,439
videos of you doing that or counting the

370
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,360
money afterwards and bragging about it

371
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,630
not saying I condone the oligo

372
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,250
activities but maybe if you if they had

373
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,290
a little more online privacy thing would

374
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,730
have gone Carl doing the bad things they

375
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,380
were doing just saying also if you live

376
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,380
under a repressive or tyrannical

377
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,750
government or something like that the

378
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,089
activities you do online if they can be

379
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,220
traced back to you you could face

380
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,260
prisons or fines prison sentences

381
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,060
possibly death depending on what it was

382
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,279
you're doing having a way to separate

383
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,989
yourself from that activity or that data

384
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,660
that you're providing it's gonna be

385
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,519
critical to these people if you're in

386
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,649
witless relocation or you just have

387
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,630
someone you're trying to avoid whether

388
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,230
it's an ex-coworker

389
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,380
it's a previous significant other or if

390
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,269
it's just some online stalker anything

391
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,430
in that ramp you're not gonna want to

392
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:57,500
give them any ammunition as to you how

393
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,839
to find you how to contact you where you

394
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,180
live I thought that so keeping that

395
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,710
information offline goes a long ways

396
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,569
toward that as well

397
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,730
like I said basically everybody has

398
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,170
information that they want to protect or

399
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,680
information that is critical to their

400
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:18,140
safety that's why this is super

401
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:20,359
important all right fine fine I've tried

402
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,069
to scare you enough into trying to be

403
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,050
aware of your online security and all

404
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,390
that now what can you do about it

405
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,400
especially for those of you like me or

406
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,140
many others I know who all right you've

407
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,640
presented so much information to the

408
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,439
Internet I've got a gmail account

409
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,819
I've got YouTube channels I've got a

410
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,200
Facebook account I got a LinkedIn

411
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,090
account I've got all this data out there

412
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,160
and about myself already well what can I

413
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,160
do if I wanted to restrict some of that

414
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,719
data well first of all I said that you

415
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,819
can't get rid of all of it you can do a

416
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,110
great job about it and try to limit it

417
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,350
but you're not ever gonna be able to get

418
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,350
rid of all of it next

419
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,710
is to try to figure out how to remove as

420
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,060
much of it as you can some of it you're

421
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,100
not gonna be able to remove as I said

422
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,869
before some of it your being able to

423
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,300
change but you won't be able to remove

424
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,609
that goes back to that entire sense

425
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,000
thing when I had a several slots Bank

426
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,219
that said trying to prevent them from

427
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,949
gathering accurate Oh said about you

428
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,990
well if they gather data but that David

429
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:25,260
is incorrect it's not going to do them

430
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,970
any good so if you can change it that's

431
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,720
gonna be a go along less I for example

432
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,400
if you go to delete an account and it

433
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,050
says that oh I'm sorry you can't delete

434
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,210
this account but you can change your

435
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,710
data well change what your email address

436
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,790
is change what your home address is

437
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,740
change your birthday to January 1st 1970

438
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,780
or whatever unless that is your birthday

439
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,850
you want to pick something else but just

440
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,639
change it to nonsensical data and then

441
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,169
save it then then whenever your data

442
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,480
gets aggregated with a bunch of others

443
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,360
for market research or there's a data

444
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,040
breach or some I hacked into your

445
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,040
account they're not gonna see the real

446
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,899
data in there because you've changed it

447
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,670
well if you can delete your account I

448
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,530
still recommend you to change it because

449
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,240
just because you flagged it for deletion

450
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,680
and you can't log into it anymore

451
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,990
doesn't mean it's removed from their

452
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,970
servers removed from their databases it

453
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,980
might still be in there and may be able

454
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,350
to be accessed through some other

455
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,440
mechanism or through a data breach or

456
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,689
through market dump stuff like that

457
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,060
so there again change it before you

458
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,520
delete it so ok how do you go about

459
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,020
doing this well first thing I would say

460
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,060
is try to build a list of all the

461
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,600
accounts that you know that you have you

462
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,820
have a Facebook Gmail MySpace whatever

463
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,740
it is whatever accounts you have make a

464
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,510
list of those any that you don't want

465
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,100
your name on you're gonna go in and try

466
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,830
to change your data and delete it

467
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,959
there's other services like name check

468
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,939
check usernames and several others as

469
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,070
well where you if you have a standard

470
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,420
username that you use and go put that in

471
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,970
there and they'll tell you all the

472
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,470
places that you've created a count or

473
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,660
somebody using that name has an account

474
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,640
in the past I've done this on myself and

475
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm like wow I forgot to actually create

476
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,330
an account over there because it's like

477
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,350
for some free service that's like oh I

478
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,970
needed that one

479
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,760
I created an account use my standard

480
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:18,450
username for it or my online handle for

481
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,400
it and then forgot about it so this

482
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,440
helps me keep track of what I've done I

483
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,919
go back and flag those for deletion

484
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,660
later on for each Mountain online

485
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,190
account that you identify or that you

486
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,340
know of like I said change your data

487
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,559
delete the account for other ones that

488
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,059
may not show up under name check or

489
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,809
check user names or ones that you

490
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:43,408
already know just search for them being

491
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:45,450
Google I don't go any service like that

492
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:46,650
if you're trying to prevent renewed from

493
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,150
being online I probably wouldn't use

494
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,690
Google or Bing or something like that

495
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,950
let go or one of the other morale

496
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,530
security-conscious search engines might

497
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,690
be a better use for your time there but

498
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,399
search for your username search for your

499
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,320
email address so I'm gonna basically duo

500
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
sent on yourself see what you're finding

501
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,840
out there anything that you find fits on

502
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,650
a website like a blog post or in a forum

503
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,809
or wherever it is and you don't want it

504
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,419
there try to first see if you can delete

505
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:20,428
it yourself to see if they have a way to

506
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:22,710
contact them for data removal whether

507
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,669
that's through some form or application

508
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,110
or just an email or whatever the case is

509
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:30,330
sometimes it's possible if it's showing

510
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,340
up in search engine results like on

511
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,299
Google or Bing you can contact them as

512
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,158
well to have it flagged for deletion

513
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,510
there's ways to limit this as I said

514
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,070
before you're never gonna be able to get

515
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,590
rid of all of it it's just at this point

516
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:48,389
trying to manage how much of information

517
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:50,129
is still out there all right so you've

518
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,100
went through you're aware of why you

519
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,409
need to watch your online security

520
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,789
you've tried to go back and minimize

521
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:59,280
your footprint to the Internet you've

522
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,020
done everything that you can on that so

523
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,049
you're got a pretty good foothold of it

524
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,720
now now how do you maintain that well

525
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:09,179
first I would say go back every I don't

526
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,789
know whatever is convenient to you I do

527
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,620
it about every three to six months

528
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,299
depending on how busy I am and do a

529
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,129
periodic check on that information again

530
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,179
see where it's out there see what's

531
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,950
going on

532
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,650
just as you go in at least once a year

533
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,029
maybe twice a year to your credit

534
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,190
agencies Equifax

535
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,929
TransUnion all those to do a credit

536
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,029
check on yourself or credit history

537
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,710
check to see if you need new accounts

538
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:33,029
have been open in your name I would

539
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,249
recommend you doing the same thing for

540
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:38,759
your online security as well where else

541
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:40,469
has my name been used where else has has

542
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,779
information on me just hope I can

543
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:45,899
periodically do that another thing I

544
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:48,119
would highly recommend you do is freeze

545
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:50,340
all your credit freeze your credit all

546
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,820
credit agencies Equifax TransUnion it's

547
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,309
very on notice there's any number of

548
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,529
reasons for that first and foremost is

549
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,149
so that if ma does a credit check on you

550
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,710
or tries to open an account in your name

551
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:04,768
or anything dealing with your credit

552
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,119
you're gonna be alerted to it ran it in

553
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,099
order to be alerted to it they have to

554
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,699
have your email and phone number and

555
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,019
name but it's a trade off on what are

556
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,139
you trying to protect they're more than

557
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,789
the others so just be aware of that now

558
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,839
this is I'm never gonna repeat multiple

559
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,059
times throughout the rest of these

560
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,739
slides is that I am NOT a lawyer I do

561
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,609
not have legal background I do not have

562
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:29,759
legal training if you do something I

563
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:32,428
mention here or talk about and you get

564
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,169
in trouble for it that's on you I'm not

565
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,739
trying to advocate doing anything

566
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,809
illegal

567
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:40,080
anyplace along here but depending on

568
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,029
where you live what state you live in

569
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,320
what the laws over your particular

570
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,379
little district things of that nature

571
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,759
just be aware not a house either there

572
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:53,070
you go very good so it's fallen down to

573
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,479
a lot of us grow up being taught tell

574
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,989
the truth tell the truth I always tell

575
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:57,869
the truth

576
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:59,879
well I'm here to tell you that sometimes

577
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:02,449
you can lie especially when filling out

578
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,259
forms applications things of that as

579
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,869
previously when I say go ahead and

580
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,159
change your data to random nonsensical

581
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:13,080
data before you delete it

582
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,499
same thing here when you go to fill out

583
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,689
some application form questionnaire

584
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:21,359
whatever it is many times there's all

585
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,039
those questions on there or fill in the

586
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,859
blanks are not necessary they're not

587
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,239
critical some of them are some of them

588
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:29,519
aren't so the ones that are not

589
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:32,580
necessary or are optional leave them

590
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,259
blank ones that are required if you're

591
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,119
doing this in person with somebody or

592
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,830
you have the ability to talk to a person

593
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,168
about it ask them

594
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,730
is it really required what kind of

595
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,110
information do you need about me

596
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,669
something like that

597
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,399
and if there's anything in there that

598
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:49,080
isn't absolutely critical see if you can

599
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:51,989
get around filling that in or filling in

600
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,519
some other random information I don't

601
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,440
know how many times when I'm filling

602
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,769
something out that it asks me for my

603
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,620
home address and I just give them like

604
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:03,330
the White House address or which is

605
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,729
probably not a great idea or you give

606
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,649
them like Times Square or something like

607
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,720
I just give them a random address or you

608
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:12,809
give them an address from your favorite

609
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,669
TV show whatever the case is so that

610
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:19,950
it's not directly tying back to you um

611
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,960
also if somebody isn't if you walk up

612
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,630
and talk to somebody you you're still if

613
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,960
you're like me well I like to talk

614
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,429
anyway but if you're like me or you

615
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,169
intend or somebody like me and you're

616
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,760
waiting in line at the grocery store you

617
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,620
waiting in line to get onto your

618
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,929
favorite theme park ride whatever the

619
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,129
case is you must strike up conversations

620
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,260
with people you meet somebody at a

621
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,450
company get-together or at a conference

622
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,539
or aren't that you're just talking to

623
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,970
them unless it's like you're trying to

624
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,740
recruit them for your company or you're

625
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,830
trying to talk to them telling them

626
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,480
where you work isn't always necessary

627
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:58,080
trying to tell them where you live for

628
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,260
your full-name stuff like that you don't

629
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,720
have to tell them the real truth they're

630
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,460
also going back to the filling out forms

631
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,690
application I'll do that if I'm filling

632
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,309
out a form for let's say a garbage

633
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,169
service a new garbage service to come to

634
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,320
my house to pick up garbage do they need

635
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,330
to know who my employer is not really so

636
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,309
you can put something else in there if

637
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,960
you need to whatever the case is just

638
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:25,889
trying to limit how much information of

639
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,639
yours is out there also to maintain your

640
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:32,789
privacy is if you're like most people

641
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:35,039
you're gonna have friends family someone

642
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:36,690
out there who knows you and is also on

643
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,250
the internet they're probably going to

644
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,590
try to share pictures of you or

645
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,809
information about you online you can ask

646
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,370
them not to do that as I'm not to tag

647
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:50,490
you in pictures as I'm not to associate

648
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,659
your name with those pictures or those

649
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,890
events or whatever

650
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,120
you're gonna get some strange looks but

651
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,460
usually in my experience they're gonna

652
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,110
understand to some degree think you're

653
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,840
that odd person in the family and just

654
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,090
let it go and try not to associate as

655
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,080
much but you can try to limit that kind

656
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,480
of information as well if you're

657
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,490
concerned about people knowing where

658
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,810
your home at where you live and you've

659
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,020
done a good job about proving that

660
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:20,310
already well you can always set up

661
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,590
another physical address or another

662
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:25,530
Dropbox location to receive your mail to

663
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,590
receive packages I do stuff like this

664
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,879
for certain online companies or if I'm

665
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,570
ordering it to them off of Etsy or

666
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,970
something like that

667
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't always haven't come to the house

668
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:37,650
you can set up p.o box if you want or

669
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,560
you can set up a service through like

670
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,680
the UPS Store or mailbox comm or any of

671
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,169
these other services melba ok the post

672
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,140
office is a good one and then it's

673
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,120
almost everywhere but they don't to my

674
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,220
knowledge they don't accept deliveries

675
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,320
from Mike UPS FedEx stuff like that and

676
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,970
in order to sign up to it you have to

677
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,970
provide them some information and it is

678
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,190
tight and it is a federal organization

679
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,930
there is it is a government organization

680
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,520
there so if you want to avoid that

681
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,120
that's fine something like at the UPS

682
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,610
Store which I use is actually really

683
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,929
good because they do accept FedEx

684
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,070
deliveries they accept all kind of

685
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,810
deliveries that way it is a private

686
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,310
company it's not a federal company I

687
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,590
should say not a government company so

688
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,830
some of the amounts of information that

689
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,600
they require is optional so you can get

690
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,060
around a lot of issues with that and

691
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,560
just give that address out anytime we

692
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,419
want something delivered or they ask you

693
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,300
watch your addresses just give them that

694
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,860
a UPS store address it's even better if

695
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,120
it's not in your local town but it's in

696
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,149
like another town nearby

697
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,270
that you can get to easily that way it's

698
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,220
another step away who want to give out a

699
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,930
phone number to somebody or website

700
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,700
requires it you could either use

701
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,960
something like Google Voice or something

702
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,960
like that to get an alternate phone

703
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,360
number or you could go and get a burner

704
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,960
phone don't get a prepaid phone from

705
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,419
like Walmart or wherever and just use

706
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,800
that phone number wow there's ways to

707
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,460
separate yourself and of course

708
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,590
absolutely

709
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,409
case if you feel that you've been the

710
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,418
victim of like identity theft or there's

711
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,580
some other issue this is Social Security

712
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,380
number you can go to Social Security

713
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,918
Administration and get a new security

714
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:23,250
number assigned to you um personally I

715
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,350
don't do that I feel that in my case I'd

716
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,450
be a horrible headache I've going back

717
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,908
and taking care of passports and all

718
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,169
that but if that is something that you

719
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:35,730
need you can always do that as well

720
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,799
all right that's great that's great

721
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,690
but um you can take it a step further if

722
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,639
you want and actually make a full

723
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,919
additional identity for yourself that

724
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,320
you use for online purchases that you

725
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,630
use for a lot of your online I did a

726
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,860
online interaction and stuff like that I

727
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,370
know several people who do something

728
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:00,360
like this and depending on your threat

729
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:04,229
model or your your ability to accept

730
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,340
certain levels of risk you might do some

731
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,440
of this you might do all of this you

732
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,559
might do way more than this but I'm just

733
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,960
giving you a little feel for it right

734
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,270
here the standard ein and concept for it

735
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,320
right now is called a sock puppet

736
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,210
disposal there's also negative

737
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,610
connotations to it that people you suck

738
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,230
puppet identities to troll people online

739
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,129
but that's not what I'm recommending

740
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,450
here yes you could use this technique to

741
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,940
do that but that's not what I'm

742
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,309
advocating a sock puppet was just an

743
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,529
alternate online identity used to hide

744
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,000
or obscure the identity of a person or a

745
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,340
group of people possibly if you want to

746
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,870
share it among them the kind of thing

747
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,090
that you're usually gonna need is you'll

748
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:45,270
need a name for one of that sock puppet

749
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,850
is you can use your own if you want you

750
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,399
can create a fake one completely random

751
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,408
one it could be nonsense of call it

752
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,389
could be just your favorite celebrity

753
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:58,020
whatever I don't recommend you try to

754
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,440
completely impersonate a real or

755
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,179
fictional or or not facial a real living

756
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,919
or dead person because that's called

757
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,130
identity theft and I don't advocate

758
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,309
identity theft but if you want to just

759
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,830
pick a let's say like a combination of

760
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,450
you and your brother's name or use your

761
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,970
middle name or instead of your last name

762
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,470
use your grandmother's maiden name or

763
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,020
something like that

764
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,929
just so that it's something that you

765
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,850
will still remember easily but it isn't

766
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,559
you and it's probably not easily to be

767
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,559
tracked back to you like for example I

768
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,928
wanted to use a captain for my last name

769
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,168
instead of Compton that's an easy typo

770
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:39,929
easy transcription error I see a lot of

771
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,640
that happening all the time or people

772
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,010
call me Alan all the time instead of

773
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,600
Adam so I might just use Alan Campton or

774
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,340
something like that it's close enough to

775
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,320
Who I am but it's not really me and it's

776
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,230
usually not gonna be associated with me

777
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,399
so something like that you could use

778
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,130
email you're going to need a way to

779
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,168
communicate with the Internet so email

780
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,890
is a great way to do that you can create

781
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:04,710
a separate email account keep in mind if

782
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:07,230
you just wanted to go really touching

783
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,820
your toe into the waters of this keep in

784
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,919
mind that most email services allow you

785
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,129
to just to put a plus sign at the end of

786
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,070
your email address so long so like my

787
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,429
gmail is adam compton at gmail.com

788
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:23,700
so I can do Adam duck Compton plus

789
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:25,409
Netflix at gmail.com and give that to my

790
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,200
netflix account so anytime I receive an

791
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:30,750
e-mail from Netflix it goes in there and

792
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,640
I can filter on that now yes that is

793
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,110
still tied to my real email account but

794
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,480
it's a way for me then to set up filters

795
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,459
to know what comes from one and at some

796
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,929
point I could block and just delete

797
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,929
everything that comes from that email

798
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,220
address so that's one way you could do

799
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,679
it you could set up another gmail

800
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,220
account or Outlook account something

801
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,289
like that

802
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,970
those you do have to provide more

803
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,340
information they do require some level

804
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,630
of authentication or you go with

805
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,840
something like protonmail

806
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,700
or other secure encrypted email accounts

807
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,350
that they don't ask too many questions

808
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:07,049
they don't maintain or they do consider

809
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,908
your privacy and try not to keep too

810
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,580
much data on you they do encrypt all the

811
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:13,110
emails all that it's a great one for if

812
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,039
you want to maintain some level of

813
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:18,299
security and anonymity out there at some

814
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,140
point you're probably gonna want to buy

815
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:23,429
something if you can do it in cash great

816
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:27,630
cash isn't really an option part to

817
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:29,130
doing prepaid gift cards prepaid gift

818
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,610
cards are probably the way to go with

819
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,350
that your cards are most online

820
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,010
services allow that you could even

821
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:40,379
possibly fund like a PayPal account with

822
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,210
a debit card if you wanted I think

823
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,409
that's still possible either way those

824
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,669
are things that aren't traced back to

825
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:46,409
you and you can provide whatever

826
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:48,539
information when you're signing out for

827
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:50,820
that debit card we want it to be Auto

828
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:52,049
refillable usually you have to tie to a

829
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,289
bank account or something of that nature

830
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:58,200
so that's a fuel to do that phones as I

831
00:32:55,289 --> 00:33:00,200
said before burner phones are great you

832
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,250
can usually get those with little to no

833
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,710
information needed from you to set them

834
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,269
up pay for them with cash or with a

835
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,760
prepaid debit card that way there's no

836
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:10,350
tracing back to you addresses I've

837
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,399
already talked about that UPS store as a

838
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,980
given on that browsers your again

839
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,620
depending on how deep into the rabbit

840
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,279
hole you want to go you could use a

841
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,489
browser to use this incognito mode use a

842
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,990
tor enabled browser use ad blocker - all

843
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,830
these things are just layers upon layers

844
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,789
of things you can do to help prevent

845
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,870
websites prevent companies from

846
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:38,940
gathering information about you a huge

847
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:41,189
one that doesn't even need to be in a

848
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,350
new identity it's just a online security

849
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,029
in general is passwords maintain

850
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,158
separate passwords for our accounts

851
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:49,649
especially for financials or anything

852
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:53,070
that has any bit of critical information

853
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:56,070
to you in it why is this important data

854
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,658
leaks companies get breach data gets

855
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,230
leaked out there and if they can

856
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,730
associate your email address with that

857
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,470
password and then they can use something

858
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,820
like name check or something like that

859
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,099
to find where else you have an account

860
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,199
or guess that because you live in a

861
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:13,169
certain town it's very likely your bank

862
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,580
is XYZ or you've mentioned it somewhere

863
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:16,529
they might be able to log into your

864
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,649
account with that password that it was

865
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,540
stolen from some other website I if you

866
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,219
don't have you if you do not reuse the

867
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,918
same password that's not going to be a

868
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,500
concern so just be aware of that there's

869
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,609
great password managers out there

870
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:34,109
applications both cloud-based as well as

871
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:36,139
you can put it on a thumb drive do it on

872
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,569
your laptop whatever there's great

873
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:41,369
applications out there

874
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:44,069
additionally VPNs use a VPN I recommend

875
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,410
this for everybody as well if possible

876
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:48,389
especially if you're trying to make

877
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:51,690
some level of obscurity between the

878
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:54,389
internet and yourself the one that you

879
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,960
trust they're all not created equal some

880
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,850
of them are a little more spy than

881
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,980
others meaning that they try to make

882
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,860
they track your activity a lot better

883
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,560
than others and I try to avoid those

884
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,660
find ones that you trust they're always

885
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,380
changing there's new things new VPNs

886
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,870
coming out all the time

887
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,900
just keep abreast of that and find one

888
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:17,549
that you like additional thoughts if

889
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,350
you're wanting to do this I'm building a

890
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,990
full an identity for red teaming all

891
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,360
that you might want to try to create at

892
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,950
least token social media pages for it if

893
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,170
you're wanting it to be believable

894
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,490
that's beyond the scope of my talk about

895
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,760
here but those are just kind of things

896
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:35,430
you need to be aware of and if for some

897
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,930
reason an account gets compromised too

898
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,330
much information gets known about it

899
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,430
people do start tying it back to you be

900
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,470
willing to destroy that count if needed

901
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,060
that's why you don't do anything

902
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,509
critical with that account everything is

903
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,759
tied to that alternate identity and you

904
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,950
delete it and then you go through the

905
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,730
process of creating a new one and then

906
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:59,129
you start over excuse me

907
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,320
it's just what these things that if you

908
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,870
make this socket count or a sock puppet

909
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,370
account your real identity and you do so

910
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,650
much with it then you're not really

911
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,140
separating it from you you have to

912
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,000
maintain some of what alternate identity

913
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,890
it is a roll your plane it is a

914
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,920
alternate identity you use for

915
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:20,490
interacting on gaming websites you use

916
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,020
it for interacting with conferences

917
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,959
whatever the case is and then you

918
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,000
separate that from your real identity so

919
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,740
the only way this is gonna work is if

920
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,210
you maintain enough separation there

921
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,368
that you're able to destroy that

922
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:37,729
alternate identity if the taste comes up

923
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,709
as I said before is this illegal I don't

924
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,390
know

925
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:43,848
depending on how far down the path you

926
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,779
go and some of this possibly depending

927
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,410
on where you live

928
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:50,029
possibly you're an adult use common

929
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,609
sense on this use my best judgment I let

930
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:55,719
this research the laws that wherever you

931
00:36:52,609 --> 00:37:00,890
live and operate if it's a viable or not

932
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:02,660
and then do as you see fit with that the

933
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:07,640
things I'm recommending or not to be

934
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:09,170
used to identity of a particular person

935
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,239
or something on that order from on or

936
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,749
harming somebody but these things that

937
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:18,469
you might want to aware of but still try

938
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:21,140
not to cause harm with this and if you

939
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,249
do get in trouble not my fault just let

940
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,949
me know these are the kinda things you

941
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:28,698
can do to help restrict your internet

942
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:31,279
presence a little my slides will be

943
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:34,219
posted up on now what did you call it

944
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:37,459
scared okay we posted up on the website

945
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,779
after a while I also posted up on I'll

946
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:41,598
put a link out on my Twitter account

947
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:43,849
later on as well if you want to find my

948
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,249
slides as well as these reference

949
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:47,420
resources for examples are kind of fine

950
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:50,359
it's all the things I've talked about

951
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,549
already it's how to find your social

952
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:55,939
media accounts get a new social freezer

953
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:58,189
crate and all that kind of stuff no good

954
00:37:55,939 --> 00:38:01,009
one down there to maintain eye out for

955
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:03,558
his um have I been pound it's a good one

956
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:05,749
just to see for my email address for my

957
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,999
sock puppet email address has it been

958
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:11,569
involved in a data breach somewhere

959
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:14,479
along the line a few parting thoughts

960
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:16,130
here what I said before said during this

961
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:19,549
presentation this may not be for

962
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,989
everyone um you may just want to touch

963
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:23,299
your toe in the water on a little bit

964
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,979
you may want to jump in headfirst and go

965
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:27,170
far beyond anything I've talked about on

966
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:31,399
here that's all on you and whatever your

967
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:33,170
level of tolerance is for your online

968
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,219
privacy as well as how much pain you

969
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,049
want to go through doing this because

970
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,640
everything I've talked about there is a

971
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:39,799
little bit of inconvenience with it

972
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,479
because you have to go through and pay

973
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:43,189
for everything with cash or get their

974
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:45,348
cards to pay for it or things like that

975
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:47,058
there is inconvenience for that but if

976
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:48,140
you're willing to do that great if

977
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,160
you're not well

978
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,890
maybe you want to try something else

979
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,259
then to always just keep in mind that

980
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,910
your privacy and your data are available

981
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,250
valuable to not just you but to other

982
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,170
people and if you can prevent giving it

983

985
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:09,430

yeah this infestations just an overview

988
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,830
into the online you can go way deeper on

989
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:20,240
any of the topics I've talked about

990
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:23,270
including setting up sock puppet

991
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,049

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,270
aren't great resources as well they are

998
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,950
going to touch on different aspects of

999
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,470
what I talked on they not gonna be a

1000
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,600
complete overlap that first from up

1001

1002
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:58,130
interesting one as he kind of went full

1003
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,540
hermit almost with it uh getting his

1004
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,120
family involved in all that where they

1005
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,410
don't tell anybody about anything and if

1006

into you that are no longer than and

1009
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,640

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,890
anybody be able to find where they are

1011
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,509

1012
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,129
definitely recommend you watching it all

1013
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,540
these have great things about them in

1024
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,910
be around right now and afterwards I'll

1025
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,629
be on discord as well if people have any

1026
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:56,210
questions there so there are questions

1027
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:00,690
Adam there's a very healthy amount of

1028
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:04,260
chat in the discord of this track a

1029
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:08,130
and GoToWebinar but but I was gonna say

1030
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,920
never go full hermit yeah it's hard to

1031
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:13,380
come back it's hard to come back it's

1032
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,730
just I don't know for it depends on what

1033
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,109
kind of person you are you know some

1034
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,160
person some people are fine with that

1035
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:21,930
but that seems stressful to me but I was

1036
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,490
never retire I think I might go full

1037
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:27,810
harm it out in the middle of Montana

1038
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,939
somewhere but that's actually resumes

1039
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:32,160
from people that have pretty much

1040
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,369
scrubbed the internet of any information

1041
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,759
I'm so used to so used to using the

1042
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,069
Internet

1043
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,109
LinkedIn stuff like that to kind of fill

1044
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:42,000
in the gaps on the resume you know like

1045
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:44,310
I want to see some examples of them

1046
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,200
interacting with other humans like is

1047
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,740
this a human I would want to interact

1048
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,770
with on a daily basis when nothing out

1049
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,118
there about them you know it's it's it's

1050
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,530
a little tough you know it's kind of

1051
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,760
become a norm to at least find some

1052
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,240
information about somebody

1053
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,900
professionally online if not personally

1054
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,970
right so to a few questions about what

1055
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,190
VPN to choose you know there's so many

1056
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,890
options out there it's such it just

1057
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:13,560
exploded you know and surely some of

1058
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:17,910
them are are run by the Venezuelan and

1059
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:20,339
Russian government's right so I will

1060
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,319
refrain from recommending any VPN for

1061
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,089
the sole purpose that as soon as I say

1062
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,099
it I can almost guarantee you it has

1063
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:29,880
been hacked or somebody's found an issue

1064
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:32,310
with it yeah I switch I switch VPNs

1065
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,829
probably about twice a year honestly

1066
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,750
just because I found out something about

1067
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,579
my particular VPN provider that I don't

1068
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,319
like so I switched to another one or

1069
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,690
somebody's running a really good deal

1070
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,069
like oh I've read great reviews of it

1071
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:48,270
but they're up and coming they're like

1072
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:50,339
hey I've got six like you can get a 50%

1073
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:52,589
discount on your yearly membership water

1074
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:55,500
okay I'll check it out but um I try to

1075
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:56,250
find ones that are good to me at that

1076
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,230
moment

1077
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,109
um there's always been some great ones I

1078
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:04,050
can go back and see what I have on my

1079
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:05,759
list of possibly good ones and I can

1080
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,290
post that in this court in a moment I

1081
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,230
don't have that readily available right

1082
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,819
in front of me but right now a lot of

1083
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,140
like anything I do for my business

1084
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:15,880
through a trusted SEC I can

1085
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,589
to their corporate VPN I just go out

1086
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,970
through one of their portals and let it

1087
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:22,720
be handled there but for my personal

1088
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:24,730
information if it's going to my bank

1089
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,279
that I use I don't necessarily use a VPN

1090
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:28,960
for that if I'm going online I might use

1091
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:30,579
the VPN and it depends on what I'm using

1092
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,559
it a lot of times sometimes I'll just

1093
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:34,960
rely just on tour for a lot of it just

1094
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,380
be aware that if somebody is monitoring

1095
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,940
the endpoint they can do some heuristics

1096
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,289
to find out who you are but I will try

1097
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,880
to get that information over onto this

1098
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:48,730
court in a moment yeah so I also if

1099
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:52,630
you're not in the discord I highly

1100
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:55,599
recommend that it's I'm sure you'll get

1101
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,880
some VPN recommendations in there if you

1102
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,819
don't from from us people will be happy

1103
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,010
to someone yes yeah I personally use

1104
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:08,558
tunnel bear and I know a lot of people

1105
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:09,940
don't like to acquire him but but they

1106
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,670
were one of the only ones I could find

1107
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,250
that did multiple third party audits on

1108
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,529
their software their infrastructure all

1109
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,890
that which I respected that they did

1110
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:25,059
that that's what I you know I use tunnel

1111
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:29,009
bear on my phone so do you managing

1112
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:32,890
multiple identities get good at

1113
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:34,599
compartmentalization honestly um I spent

1114
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,450
you know I can look at my LinkedIn all

1115
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,910
that I spent a good 10 years of my life

1116
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:42,160
working for federal government and it

1117
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,990
was at a place where what you do at work

1118
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,328
stays at work what you do at home stays

1119
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,368
at home so I've got trained early on on

1120
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:49,750
trying to separate two identities for

1121
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:51,839
myself my work identity and my own

1122
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:55,359
identity and that's just carried over

1123
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,690
but basically you can get notebooks

1124
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,900
write down keep a separate notebook for

1125
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,819
each identity if you want in one it's

1126
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,109
going to be fairly safe to do that as

1127
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:06,220
long as you're not concerned about

1128
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,670
somebody breaking into your house to

1129
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:11,109
find out your alternate identity but

1130
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,569
yeah you take a notebook you write down

1131
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:16,808
all the information about that identity

1132
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:18,819
in there its name its address that you

1133
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:20,400
assign to it all that stuff and maintain

1134
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,869
it that way

1135
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,690
if you want to do the electronically

1136
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:27,640
that's great just do it in an encrypted

1137
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:30,850
container something like that and a note

1138
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,470
voters something like that I tend to go

1139
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:36,190
old-school with that and not try to keep

1140
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,868
that kind of information even associated

1141
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,430
with my other accounts on my computer so

1142
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,290
I run it down in notebook stuff like

1143
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,060
that if I have to but other than that

1144
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,970
that's that's my general recommendation

1145
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,549
for that and just get good at

1146
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:51,609
compartmentalization so personally I use

1147
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:54,070
my password manager to manage that kind

1148
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,890
of stuff the details you know if I have

1149
00:45:54,070 --> 00:46:00,520
other identities that I use like I

1150
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:02,230
actually created an identity just to see

1151
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,500
if I could create a fake company to win

1152
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:08,200
security vendor security awards and and

1153
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,150
I had to build that whole personality he

1154
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,060
had his own LinkedIn and everything and

1155
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,380
what I did in chrome at least I think

1156
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,040
you can do this in other browsers as

1157
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,610
well like Firefox has some way of

1158
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,440
compartmentalizing on different things

1159
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,360
where cookies are stored in a different

1160
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,790
location you know there's no way one

1161
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,710
identity is gonna leak to the other but

1162
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,450
chrome like the little circle with your

1163
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,940
avatar if you click that you can create

1164
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:33,100
other person's and it makes it super

1165
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,810
easy to switch to that other profile

1166
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,420
like when I view sales demos for

1167
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,310
think'st I have a sales demo one so like

1168
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,290
when I'm typing a domain you know it

1169
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:44,440
doesn't pull something from my history

1170
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,420
from my my personal stuff into the sales

1171
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,530
demo and you see that autocomplete for a

1172
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:52,210
moment as I'm typing a URL stuff like

1173
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,630
that can be handy well then I would

1174
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:58,720
recommend also is something I do is I

1175
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,970
have a bunch of VMs I have one VM for my

1176
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,970
anything I do financially is done on

1177
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,339
that VM anything I do that is a

1178
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,759
development base for with my coding

1179
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,410
environment I do on another VM that way

1180
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,570
anything I do for my work laptop itself

1181
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:15,730
is for work related I switch over to one

1182
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,460
of the VMs to do my other work it helps

1183
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,650
keep another level of a separation and

1184
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,750
stuff like that out if I'm wanting to

1185
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,180
spin up a new sock puppet account sorry

1186
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,410
I'll fire off another VM and then I'll

1187
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,210
go in and set everything up in there

1188
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,549
I'll set up a password manager in there

1189
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:34,450
I'll set up Chrome or Firefox whatever

1190
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,609
and therefore that account so yeah do

1191
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,970
you use separate password managers as a

1192
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:41,210
question that we got yes well I use the

1193
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,609
same password manager

1194
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:46,940
different instances of it one for each

1195
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:50,150
account so it sounds like you always the

1196
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,900
same one just yeah pipeline or clears it

1197
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:56,540
like a cloud sync password manager um I

1198
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,600
use what is it here I don't remember

1199
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,370
which one I'm using offhand you keep in

1200
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,819
there something like that it's either

1201
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:06,500
keypads for LastPass I have it all

1202
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,830
flying under a thumb drive as well but I

1203
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:13,760
also have it associated with whichever

1204
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:16,790
VMI man at the time as well so yes so

1205
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,590
there's a mother you can always go into

1206
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:21,470
them say generate a random password it

1207
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:24,230
generates 14 characters 20 characters

1208
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,919
with random up case or case I just do

1209
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,140
that it's easier for them to remember it

1210
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,120
yeah so so there's a few questions I'm

1211
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,520
gonna I'm gonna pass on but if you have

1212
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,470
time after this Adam if you just want to

1213
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,890
stand through the the track one channel

1214
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,540
there's some really good question but at

1215
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,520
this point it's it's too many for me to

1216
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,810
read them all out no no no no worries no

1217
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,120
worries I'll jump on there and answer

1218
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:54,950
what I can okay

1219
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:59,180
stop showing yes so last question here

1220
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:01,100
that I'm gonna read out is any ideas for

1221
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:04,750
not providing biometric data for

1222
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:07,370
multi-factor apps I guess some apps like

1223
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:13,370
on the phone ask for fingerprint I'm not

1224
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:18,290
sure um does it allow for other options

1225
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:20,450
on there use a different finger I don't

1226
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,070
know uh get your sister to come in there

1227
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:25,490
and put her finger down out and I don't

1228
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,960
know yeah walk up to ask your mailman

1229
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,520
every time they stopped by yeah I need

1230
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,530
your finger a minute come here I mean

1231
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,470
unless you're willing to go to that

1232
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:37,580
level of separation you're good your

1233
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:39,709
biometrics are tied to you good you

1234
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:43,610
could score up your finger if you want I

1235
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,170
don't recommend bodily harm you can I've

1236
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,240
known people who were secretaries for

1237
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:49,370
years and their fingerprints wear off

1238
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:55,319
which makes biometrics really aren't for

1239
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:57,839
them at that time um but it's not

1240
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,760
not it's good into your genetics it's

1241
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,010
really hard to change a biometric sorry

1242
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,840
yeah so apparently the person asked a

1243
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,790
question there there's an app that only

1244
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,060
gives you face ID or fingerprint it's

1245
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:10,920
your only option for unlocking that

1246
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:15,270
multi-factor app which kind of sucks

1247
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,180
like most I've seen will at least let

1248
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:21,030
you set a pin instead of using

1249
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:22,770
biometrics so my suggestion would be do

1250
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,960
you have to use that multi-factor app

1251
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:29,250
you know because I know a lot if you use

1252
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,380
in one time they said dog pop I don't

1253
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,330
know if yeah I was wondering if like

1254
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:38,580
your elbow you know something else would

1255
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:41,700
with register as a finger part so the

1256
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:48,270
body can be used I'll leave it there but

1257
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:49,620
yeah I was gonna say do I have yes if

1258
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,590
you're just doing one time password

1259
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,299
something like that you don't have to

1260
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,740
use the Google Authenticator app you

1261
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,630
know maybe you don't have to use duo

1262
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,979
like if you can actually register the

1263
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:04,260
multi-factor authentication app yourself

1264
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:06,300
like I use of--they for some one-time

1265
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,270
passwords I use one password actually

1266
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,760
supports doing those codes

1267
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:13,230
so there's actually maybe there's a

1268
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,990
chance you can use a different app this

1269
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:18,390
is the only ID I have and the other

1270
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:21,270
option is is whatever is requiring you

1271
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,400
to use that do you have to use that if

1272
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:25,110
it is if it's your company mandating you

1273
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,790
have to use it maybe there's not another

1274
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,830
option but talk to that D manager see if

1275
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,570
they have a alternate way for you to do

1276
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:33,630
it or something like that or if it's an

1277
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:35,100
application that's requiring that um is

1278
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,360
there another application that doesn't

1279
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,480
have that requirement that's just as

1280
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,040
good I don't know I mean it's you always

1281
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,050
have the option of just saying no and

1282
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,500
going elsewhere possibly I guess but

1283
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:49,200
yeah right yeah all right so I think

1284
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,240
that's I think that's about it sounds

1285
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,770
great I'm gonna jump over to discord and

1286
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,529
see what else is saying over there and

1287
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,660
try to answer what I can so awesome

1288
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,580
thank you very much Adam Thank You

1289
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,350
Adrian thank you for all of the besides

1290
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:04,700
like sort of proved there and thanks for

1291
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,700
everybody coming in
