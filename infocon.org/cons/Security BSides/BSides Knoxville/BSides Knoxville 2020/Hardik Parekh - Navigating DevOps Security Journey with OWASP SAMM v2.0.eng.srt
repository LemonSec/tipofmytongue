1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,300

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,800
screen and can you hear me out

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,009
we're all good okay all right so good

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,169
after everyone and thanks for having me

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,689
here I'm really excited to be here

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,670
presenting on this topic which is near

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,320
and dear to my heart which is navigating

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,390
their web security Ernie with OS per Sam

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,610
software assurance maturity model and

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,580
one of the core members of Austin

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,960
project first of all I want to thank

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,940
besides Knoxville for scheduling this

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,700
atlas for me this is the first online

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,739
event that I've been attending I'm sure

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,739
the same thing for many of you hopefully

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,610
I'll get what you come to Knoxville next

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,519
year before we dive deep into the topic

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,879
I want to share my professional journey

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,750
line so just let's spend two minutes on

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,750
Who am I

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,050
so I signed my career as a software

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,960
engineer and I got introduced to

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,130
security when I was doing my master's in

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,839
complete science at unity of Florida my

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,160
very first professional exposure to

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,440
security was when I was Adele and I was

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,380
asked to kind of build a hickory and pen

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,509
testing team from there I got an

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,640
opportunity to bootstrap EMC spark

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,770
security program after that I led

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,580
various product information security

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,429
teams at companies like Intuit Amazon

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,470
and Splunk I'm also on an advisory board

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,680
for a few security and data privacy

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,530
startups as well as the nonprofit trade

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
organization called CompTIA which many

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,830
of you might be familiar with pompeii

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,500
shoes IT security certifications such as

40
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,840
security plus and size Atlas but

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,820
throughout my career I also contributed

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,030
to industry through safe code

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:08,130
publications science top 25 programming

44
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:12,300
errors CBS s 3.0 and besom since version

45
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:15,030
1.1 1.0 so for those of you who might

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,670
not be familiar with besom besom is

47
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,980
another so physically maturity model

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,179
which is descriptive in nature

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,519
it was developed originally by acetyl by

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,010
interviewing six independent software

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,370
vendors from safe code founding member

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,429
companies and EMP was one of them that

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,209
is how I contributed to be sim a besom

54
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,660
is more of a descriptive model versus

55
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,240
prescriptive model like Sam and by that

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,380
what I mean is this him helps you

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,599
compare with other secure organizations

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,109
and which organization is performing

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,970
which security activity at which level

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:01,840
that is what it helps to describe

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:05,170
I started contributing to OS Sam some

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,110
around 2016 and have been one of the

63
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,239
core members of La Stampa logic since

64
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,300
then

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,300
you

66
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,349
so before we start the talk just wanted

67
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,650
to get some legal stuff out of the way

68
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:26,129
I'm not speaking on behalf of my current

69
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,230
or previous employers nor am I here as a

70
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:32,370
representative of my current or previous

71
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,859
employers my opinions are solely my own

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,170
and do not reflect those of my current

73
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,780
or previous employers

74
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,130
you

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,960
so quick agenda was Sam I'm sure like

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,090
some of you might have our used or asked

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,220
them in the past some of you might be

78
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,100
very new to watch them so I wanted to

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,240
spend some time for those of the folks

80
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,299
who are new to us

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,450
Sam giving them introduction on who is

82
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,000
awesome what is awesome why do we need a

83
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,500
model like was them an overall project

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,370
history and background

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,760
Sam version 2 has been launched recently

86
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,350
in about February this year so also

87
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,298
wanted to quickly go over the highlights

88
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:23,380
of what changes we made in version 2 or

89
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:25,359
version 1.5 and last we will discuss how

90
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,500
to apply Sam in your particular

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,350
organization my goal is to make sure

92
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,380
that you walk away with enough knowledge

93
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,320
to start applying Sam in your

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,800
organization starting Monday and in the

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,409
end I'll open up for a few questions or

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,570
feedback if you already are using Sam

97
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,390
and if you have some feedback we can

98
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,460
open up for that or if you are new and

99
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,349
if you want to start using it if you're

100
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,138
any questions we'll leave some room for

101
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,199
that

102
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,199
you

103
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,379
so if you are in one of these 15 plus

104
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,989
different roles then this particular

105
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,789
talk is very useful to you and as I

106
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:10,429
mentioned you will be able to walk away

107
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:13,969
with knowledge that you can apply to

108
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:16,219
your organization and this is our like

109
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:20,719
just representation of our target

110
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:23,498
audience but mainly ba stamp is geared

111
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:27,939
towards everybody who is involved in

112
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:27,939
building and securing products

113
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:36,220
so first of all without them

114
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,050
Sam is the result of hard work of the

115
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,720
contributors around the globe over the

116
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,540
past three years this group represents

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,110
different geographies companies of

118
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:50,320
various sizes consulting and product

119
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,110
development as well as academia as a

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,570
result wast time is very versatile and

121
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,900
can be applied in companies of various

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,530
sizes across the globe there are many

123
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,530
times during the design and construction

124
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,200
of osm when we were having debates and

125
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,630
it always was very helpful to get

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,420
diverse perspective from this group of

127
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,120
new Jews because many times when we were

128
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:20,020
discussing about certain language to use

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,900
certain metrics certain guidelines

130
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,169
it was always helpful to understand the

131
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,909
perspective from somebody from South

132
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:31,120
America somebody from New Zealand

133
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,860
somebody from different parts of United

134
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,460
States as well as somebody from Europe

135
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,390
so this has helped us neutralized the

136
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:44,020
language for them and also oral model

137
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:46,719
where we wanted to make it so useful and

138
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,789
so versatile so that anybody and

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,860
everybody across the globe as well as

140
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,820
all different types of companies can use

141
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,750
it be it small a little startup or big

142
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,750
corporation

143
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:06,550
so what is awesome what Sam is one of

144
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,169
the flagship projects and flagship

145
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,800
status is given to projects with

146
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,289
strategic importance to both laws and

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,110
application security in general

148
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:19,029
om is one of those projects I believe

149
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,689
there are about fifteen or sixteen of

150
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,669
all the us projects they have received

151
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,669
the status and what then is one of those

152
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,558
projects

153
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,169
om is the framework of Software

154
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:34,509
Assurance that provides effective and

155
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:37,719
measurable way for all types of

156
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:41,289
organizations to analyze and improve

157
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,539
their software security posture that is

158
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,688
tailored to their specific risk that

159
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:49,628
particular organization is facing and

160
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:53,069
the key thing is one size doesn't fit

161
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,509
all so you really need to look at your

162
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,449
organization's risk and your own

163
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:03,009
maturity level when you start applying

164
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:05,050
osm fam is full of useful resources that

165
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,430
does help in evaluating your

166
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,999
organization's current security

167
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,789
practices providing recommendations or

168
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:15,969
suggestions for growing and maturing

169
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:18,039
those practices providing a way to

170
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,769
demonstrate concrete improvements over a

171
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,419
period of time and defining and

172
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,959
measuring security activities throughout

173
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,419
the software development lifecycle one

174
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:32,349
of the big benefits of Sam is that it is

175
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:35,889
vendor agnostic Sam can be done in-house

176
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,800
or you could have one of the several

177
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,240
application security consulting firms

178
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:44,430
help you with the assessment and

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,430
creation of plants and watermarks

180
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,650
you

181
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,019
so one of the key thing about osm is

182
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:59,019
also it's very versatile and it can be

183
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,129
used across different types of

184
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,389
organizations who are using different

185
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:09,410
types of methodology beat agile

186
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:12,600
waterfall or DevOps so why do we need a

187
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,660
model like watch them

188
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,150
lately if you see there is a quest to

189
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,660
increase speed across all different

190
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,420
types of organizations and many times

191
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,350
security might be perceived as more of a

192
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,890
hindrance in accomplishing this goal of

193
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,430
increasing speed

194
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,880
at the same time due to this increased

195
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,219
pressure of increased speed many

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,570
organizations are growing in complexity

197
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,880
with increased number of texts texts

198
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,210
various organizational structures growth

199
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,540
of open source software and various

200
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,320
deployment models beat cloud based model

201
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,160
on frame model multi platform model as

202
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,279
well as responsive design

203
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,400
the result almost 75% of the monopolies

204
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,589
these days our application related

205
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,870
to standardize security activities in

206
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:15,310
such complex software environment we

207
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,310
need a model like what SEM

208
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,819
so why was them

209
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,479
the most that can be expected from any

210
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,450
model is that it can supply useful

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,630
approximation to reality all models are

212
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:36,500
wrong some models are useful change or

213
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:40,040
box a George box is one of the great

214
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,170
statistical minds of 20th century and I

215
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,110
think one of the key thing over here is

216
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:49,819
as he says all models are wrong in some

217
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:52,460
models are useful why is that because we

218
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,100
all understand that there is no you know

219
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,250
each organization is has its own

220
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,470
challenges it has its own risk profile

221
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,750
and its own maturity level

222
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,570
as a result there are no two

223
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,090
organizations which are same if they are

224
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,580
same our life would have been much more

225
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,710
easier it would have been more like a

226
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,230
cookiecutter approach if you go from

227
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,900
organization to organization but reality

228
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,720
is different the point is that you

229
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,840
cannot find a model that will exactly

230
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,600
describe the reality there are too many

231
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,670
variables and most of the models are

232
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,360
built mainly in the academic world and

233
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,699
we live in the real world but you can

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,530
have a model that is close enough to be

235
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:44,300
useful and that is what Sam Sann is that

236
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:47,010
model which is close enough to be useful

237
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,410
but not exactly representing your

238
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,569
particular organization

239
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,600
Sam was defined with that type of

240
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,660
flexibility in versatility in mind so

241
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,380
that it can be utilized by polarizations

242
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:05,370
of various sizes with different types of

243
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,740
complexities and organizations employing

244
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:13,820
different types of development models be

245
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,640
it a gel water form or DevOps

246
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,670
in addition this model can be applied

247
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:24,439
throughout your organization or a single

248
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:27,339
line of business or individual project

249
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,779
within the organization

250
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,490
now let's look at some of the core

251
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,970
principles of spam

252
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,410
when Sam was designed we had at least

253
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:42,889
this four core principles in mind

254
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,829
first an organization's behavior changes

255
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:49,069
slowly over time

256
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:51,050
changes need to be smaller and iterative

257
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:54,920
to really take hold and make a

258
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:57,019
difference second there is no single

259
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,139
recipe that works for all different

260
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:02,360
organizations Sam is built with that in

261
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,579
mind and supports organization building

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,600
a program that is tailored to the risk

263
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:11,880
profile culture and maturity they have

264
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,340
in that particular organization

265
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,640
part the guidance related to security

266
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:20,190
activities must be prescriptive solution

267
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,290
must provide enough details for non

268
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,910
security people

269
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,920
because there are many security

270
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:30,509
initiatives which fail due to poor

271
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,839
details lack of communication or invalid

272
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,839
assumptions

273
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,300
or all the subsets of the program will

274
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,500
be based on being this model being

275
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,270
simple

276
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,960
well defined

277
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,960
and miserable

278
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,040
now for those of you who might be new to

279
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,250
Sam let's look at the project history so

280
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,829
Sam is not a brand new project was

281
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,649
project or at least even before there's

282
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,649
a history before even it came to us

283
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,969
the first version of Sam was developed

284
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:11,240
by independent software secret

285
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,620
consultant named Kovac Chandra under the

286
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,260
name of open Sam

287
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,480
and it was the first job was made

288
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,779
possible through funding from 45

289
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,839
software

290
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,149
after a number of years it was kind of

291
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:30,459
being stagnant from like somewhere on

292
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:33,069
2009 till 2015 a small group go out

293
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,309
together at was and work together to

294
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:38,110
breathe some life into this dead project

295
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:43,529
or not dead body but it was connected

296
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:47,290
project and San became awesome project

297
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:49,749
so it is no longer open Sam it is now

298
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,059
considered awesome but this is the

299
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:56,120
history like it started as an open Sam

300
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:58,279
project back in 2009

301
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,230
the ocean first version after it came

302
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:05,990
under was umbrella was version 1.1

303
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,300
it expanded and restructure its

304
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,460
predecessor into four complementary

305
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,949
resources

306
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,550
core document that describes the course

307
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,370
and model

308
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,609
how to guide that explains how to apply

309
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:24,210
this model which Start Guide to help

310
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,340
accelerate learning and eruption and the

311
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,800
most important one is the toolbox which

312
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,310
is kind of like a spreadsheet that voids

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,620
simple automation for detect election

314
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:40,560
matrix and graphs

315
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:43,790
back in 2000 1700s them came up with a

316
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,149
new version 1.5

317
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,279
version 1.5 incorporates refinement of

318
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,459
the scoring model to provide more

319
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,290
granularity to the scoring in assessment

320
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:56,979
the applying more model has been

321
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,029
designed to have Sam Assessors and

322
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,430
organizations avoid the awkward

323
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:04,250
discussion on whether to mark answer yes

324
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,469
or no when it is honestly something in

325
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,850
between and show incremental

326
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,889
improvements

327
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,509
we just launched Sam put ATO in February

328
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,569
2020 where we have changed the

329
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:21,660
measurement model one more time and this

330
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:24,449
time with aim to as qualitative

331
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,459
measurement to represent how well an

332
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,729
organization is performing the security

333
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,008
practice because in 1.5 we definitely

334
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,000
added a lot more granularity but it was

335
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,730
still missing

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,180
the key element of a qualitative

337
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:42,029
measurement and that was one of the key

338
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,888
feedback that we received across the

339
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,889
globe from Sam practitioners

340
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,980
so that is why one of the key things

341
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,280
that we wanted to change was this

342
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,460
particular aspect of the assessment and

343
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,459
measurement

344
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,380
now let's look at the maturity levels

345
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,400
and the assessment score at a very high

346
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,980
level

347
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:10,240
so at very high level therefore maturity

348
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,699
levels zero one two and three at level

349
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,939
zero particular practices completely

350
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,459
unfulfilled at level one security

351
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,700
practices perform but in an ad hoc

352
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,490
fashion

353
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:27,040
at level 2 security practices perform

354
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,790
with increased efficiency and

355
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,800
effectiveness

356
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,840
and at the highest level which is level

357
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,750
three security practices perform with

358
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:40,600
mastery at scale across the organization

359
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,460
not everyone needs to make level 3 in

360
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,370
all the areas this is one of the

361
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,620
mistakes that I've seen many of the new

362
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,929
organizations make they try clean for

363
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,389
level 3 in all different areas and that

364
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,740
is actually honestly not the boost good

365
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,740
use of your limited resources

366
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,158
the goal is not to max out on each

367
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:03,958
practice security practice in each area

368
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,919
what the target machua should be for

369
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:10,429
your organization is largely up to you

370
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,409
depending on the business drivers and

371
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:15,619
the risk your particular organization is

372
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,619
facing

373
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,350
so in version 1.5 we had modified the

374
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,330
scoring model to provide multiple choice

375
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:30,439
answers to allow for more accurate

376
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:32,270
assessment previously in Sam and most of

377
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,480
the models the questions we're like yes

378
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,520
and no which is great from like more of

379
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,279
academic perspective but in real world

380
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,039
as we all know the answer many times

381
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:48,440
lies in between the two let's take one

382
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,810
example so looking at Sam 1.5

383
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,940
if you are doing the assessment if you

384
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,270
are trying to answer the question on

385
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,880
education and guidance practice are

386
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:00,860
those involved in software development

387
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,510
process given role specific security

388
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,850
training and guidance that's the

389
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,270
question that you as an Assessor is

390
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,820
trying to assess

391
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,309
you know you have trained some of the

392
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,908
developers and would like to train some

393
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,739
project managers and cue engineers

394
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,089
but given the situation how do you

395
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,089
answer yes or no

396
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,290
now this is the dilemma if you answer no

397
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,449
you get no credit it looks like you

398
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,379
aren't working on it but actually you

399
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,170
are and if you answer yes you may get

400
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,210
full credit and may have issues down the

401
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,750
road when you are trying to ask for

402
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,480
training budget for other roles such as

403
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,490
project managers and QA engineers

404
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,920
because the - forces you already did

405
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,230
this particular activity and that was

406
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,850
the challenge in the previous model 1.5

407
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,139
with the new model you can answer

408
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:03,120
something like some or at least half so

409
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:05,580
I meant in version 1.0 and 1.1 in 1.5 we

410
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,889
added this new granularity levels where

411
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,490
you can add some or at least half and

412
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:13,350
get the partial credit but also have the

413
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,740
ability to show improvements in your

414
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:20,129
score when you finish the initiative to

415
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,100
train the other rules with the new model

416
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,299
we also change the wording to many and

417
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,129
most and not all

418
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:30,340
and these rationale behind that as well

419
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:32,379
in practice there's always some activity

420
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,928
which will not be performed for small

421
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:37,658
group of applications for the right

422
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:40,139
reasons for example if you know that

423
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:42,970
some service is retiring in near future

424
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:45,248
well you may not want to spend your

425
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,450
precious resources in getting add a

426
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:50,649
particular application in compliance and

427
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,049
you can still get the full credit

428
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:56,619
because that work application is going

429
00:20:53,049 --> 00:21:00,700
to retire anyway very soon so that is

430
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:03,999
why we also change to artists we propose

431
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,460
menu our most and not all because in

432
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:09,369
real world accomplishing all is kind of

433
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,039
a tall task and it's almost like that

434
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:15,129
long tail of like you know last few

435
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,779
applications takes you forever so that

436
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:23,070
is where we want it to be more pragmatic

437
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:23,070
and wanted to provide this flexibility

438
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,929
now before we look at Sam Porto wanted

439
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,550
to spend some time on introducing to the

440
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,930
folks who are new to Sam in version 1.5

441
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,340
so at the highest level

442
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,779
Sam version 1.5

443
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,418
is defining four critical business

444
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:46,049
functions in each business function the

445
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:48,620
category of activities related to nuts

446
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,879
and bolts bolts of software development

447
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,000
practice that your organization might be

448
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,299
following for each particular business

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,690
function Sam defined three security

450
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:04,020
practices each security practice is an

451
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:06,240
area of security activities that build

452
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,600
assurance for that particular business

453
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,279
function for each secret practice and

454
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,209
define three different levels of

455
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,799
maturity as objectives and each level

456
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,600
within a secured practice is

457
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,350
characterized by successively more

458
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,510
sophisticated objective activities as

459
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,439
well as more stringent success metrics

460
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:33,080
than its previous level

461
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,730
so this is SEM 1.5 at high level

462
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,030
now one would ask what are the

463
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,790
motivations behind a new more new

464
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:44,629
version for this model so there are five

465
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:46,580
main motivations first is aligning with

466
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:51,790
the most recent development

467
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,790
methodologies such as agile and DevOps

468
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:57,249
and when we wanted to do that our goal

469
00:22:54,909 --> 00:23:00,000
was to make it software development

470
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:02,790
methodology agnostic

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,460
because version 1.5 and its predecessors

472
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,110
look more suitable for waterfall direct

473
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,750
mythology even though it was not meant

474
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,360
to be so we kind of collected feedback

475
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,580
from sand practitioners across the globe

476
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,760
and we realized that it's missing key

477
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,110
aspects of guidance in terms of how to

478
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,060
securely build and deploy software

479
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:27,229
specially since eh series part of agile

480
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,230
and eros mythology

481
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,570
second motivation is to improve the

482
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:36,570
measurement even though Sam 1.5 address

483
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:39,600
the feedback about different granularity

484
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:42,290
levels it still did not address equation

485
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,179
how well an activity is being performed

486
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,129
thus needing some qualitative

487
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:51,000
measurement

488
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,159
the third motivation is to avoid orphan

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,309
and unrelated activities in different

490
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,919
maturity levels there are quite a few

491
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:01,980
security activities in version 1.5 and

492
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,039
its predecessors were defined such that

493
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,620
it lacked consistent theme across

494
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,799
different levels of maturity within a

495
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,000
security package which also resulted in

496
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,000
few orphan activities

497
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,280
such as scores I mean if you look at

498
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,950
version 1.5 their security practice

499
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,230
called course code signing and there's

500
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,440
literally no consistent theme in the

501
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,250
same security practice and across

502
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,950
different maturity levels

503
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,160
and also there is no similar activity

504
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,160
yet

505
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,770
mature level one and mature level three

506
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,700
so it was kinda like created more like

507
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:45,830
orphan activity

508
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,110
the fourth motivation was

509
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,330
arranging maturity levels in order of

510
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,750
increasing difficulties so this was

511
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:57,649
another shortcoming of previous Sam

512
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,480
versions it was sometimes possible that

513
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:02,689
some of the security activities at high

514
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,240
level very in fact a little bit easier

515
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,580
to implement compared to security

516
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,140
activities at the lower level now it was

517
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,539
one-way intuitive like you know if you

518
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,730
look at material level it's one would

519
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,980
assume that as you go higher in the

520
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,529
level of maturity the implementation

521
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,860
cost should be higher but that was not

522
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:23,600
the case so we had to fix that one as

523
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,389
well

524
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,000
the last but not least was Sam

525
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,940
production process itself it was slow

526
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,240
and waterfalls resulting in major

527
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,660
overhaul of work every time we needed to

528
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,550
release new version just recently in

529
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:47,510
fact Sam itself Sam project itself is on

530
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:49,820
th any itself that's a great progress

531
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:54,280
and that was also one of the motivation

532
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,280
behind the second version of Sam

533
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:01,049
now let's look at the same framework for

534
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,940
version 2.0

535
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,429
the sample dotto at very high level and

536
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:09,869
the area highlighted are changes from

537
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:13,259
version 1.5 which we'll call in few more

538
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:15,749
minutes sampled Auto is defined in three

539
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:18,480
levels again at highest level Sam

540
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:21,989
defines five critical business functions

541
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,549
versus four in version 1.5 and each

542
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:26,489
business function is the category of

543
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:28,200
activities related to nuts and bolts of

544
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:31,070
software development in your

545
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,070
organization

546
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,400
for each business function Sam defines

547
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,800
three security practices each degree

548
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,260
practice is an aerial security related

549
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,560
activities that build assurance for that

550
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,840
particular business function and for

551
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,750
each security package again Sam defines

552
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,750
three maturity level as objectives

553
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,710
with insecurity practice is

554
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,690
characterized by successively more

555
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,400
sophisticated objective and more

556
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,850
stringent success metrics than the

557
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,410
previous levels and overall as you

558
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,909
increase the level of maturity you

559
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,280
should expect higher cost of

560
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,800
implementation as I mentioned earlier

561
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,029
this is one of the area we fix in

562
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,879
version 2.0

563
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,759
if you look at the framework you can see

564
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:20,738
that governance is more focused on

565
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,099
program itself looking at more strategic

566
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:27,159
elements such as strategy and metrics

567
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:29,110
policy and compliance education and

568
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,390
guidance

569
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,399
we have renamed construction business

570
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,370
function to design business function

571
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,740
into dot o and introduce the new

572
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:43,090
business function called implementation

573
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:46,789
design implementation verification and

574
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,720
operations together cover the core of a

575
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,720
software development lifecycle

576
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,050
high level design is focused on three

577
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,750
things threat assessment security

578
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:02,129
requirements and security architecture

579
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,130
or secure architecture

580
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,630
intention is focused on secure build

581
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,920
secure deployment and defect management

582
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,990
and we are going to spend a little more

583
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,150
time on this particular business

584
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:19,090
function a little bit later

585
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,100
verification is more focused on

586
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,620
architecture analysis requirements

587
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,030
driven testing and security testing so

588
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:30,360
these are more like testing and

589
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:33,450
verification of this model

590
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,149
last but not least is operations which

591
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:39,000
is focused on incident detection and

592
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,440
management and environment management

593
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,440
where the apps live on

594
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,890
so at high level this is Sam Boudreau

595
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,890
framework

596
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,750
now let's take a closer look at security

597
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:58,510
practices in this new framework

598
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,300
if security practice is divided into two

599
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:04,760
streams stream a and stream beach

600
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,180
the purpose of the streeams is to align

601
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,470
and link the activities within the

602
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,180
practice or different maturity levels

603
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,520
each stream has an objective to be reach

604
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,760
and this objective can be reached in

605
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,920
increasing levels of maturity this way

606
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,470
we ensure that there are no orphan

607
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,350
activities that seem only relevant on a

608
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:32,230
single maturity level like for instance

609
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,230
I mentioned code signing in version 1.5

610
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,490
let's take a closer look at one of the

611
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,550
security practices which is the

612
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,020
requirement student testing under

613
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,030
verification business function to

614
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,060
understand this screen concept a little

615
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,220
bit more so requirements testing

616
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,159
security practice is divided into two

617
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:56,130
streams the stream a control

618
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,170
verification and stream B misuse or

619
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,290
abuse testing

620
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,260
this dreams aligned and linked

621
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:07,010
activities in the practice or different

622
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,020
maturity levels as you can see

623
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,060
eastream has an objective to be reached

624
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,500
and this objective can be reaching

625
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,510
increasing levels of maturity

626
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,820
anystream also provides that consistent

627
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,150
theme across three different maturity

628
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,149
levels

629
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:33,990
as I mentioned earlier the key changes

630
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:36,689
in this particular model are

631
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,090
imitation business function under which

632
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,670
secure build and secure deployment are

633
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:45,480
the key practices which are more years

634
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:47,370
towards DevOps and agile practices so

635
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,309
let's take a look a little bit closer

636
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,629
look at this particular security

637
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:55,340
practices

638
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,960
so secure bill

639
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,139
this practice focuses on creating

640
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,960
consistently repeated repeatable secure

641
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,620
build process and accounting for

642
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,710
security of application dependencies as

643
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,469
I mentioned earlier in today's complex

644
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,660
world there are a lot of organizations a

645
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,240
lot of developers they use third-party

646
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,820
open source libraries and some other

647
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,490
dependencies so it was important to

648
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,389
include that particular aspect in coming

649
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,390
up with the new model

650
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,750
the secure bill practice emphasises the

651
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,169
importance of building software in

652
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,510
standardized and repeatable manner and

653
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:38,400
of doing so using secure components

654
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,670
including third-party software

655
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,890
dependencies as you can see the first

656
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:48,630
stream which is Bill crosses focusing on

657
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,790
removing any subjectivity from the build

658
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,060
process by striving for full automation

659
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:56,220
at level 3 and automated bill pipeline

660
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,429
can include additional automated

661
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,760
security checks such as fast and as to

662
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:05,370
gain further assurance and flag security

663
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,920
regressions early by failing the bill

664
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,570
for example now I'm not recommending

665
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,780
that tomorrow everybody should start

666
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,330
failing to build based on SAS and as

667
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:19,230
result because there's a lot of work

668
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:22,560
need to happen before back such as you

669
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,930
need to remove false positives you need

670
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,090
to remove noise from some of these tools

671
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:29,570
because most of these tools they have

672
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,730
some level of noise that they introduce

673
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,580
once you remove that noise and then you

674
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:39,120
have full confidence that the issues

675
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,570
identified by these tools they are high

676
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,669
confidence high fidelity issues then you

677
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,919
could reach to that level and that is

678
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:50,510
the reason that that particular aspect

679
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,510
is as metric level 3

680
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,800
the second stream which is software

681
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,540
dependencies how is the prevalence of

682
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,659
software dependencies in modern

683
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,899
applications it aims to identify them

684
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,540
and track the security status in order

685
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:12,070
to contain the impact of the insecurity

686
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:14,800
on other ways secure application the

687
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,810
most advanced form it applies similar to

688
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,720
each extra software dependencies as to

689
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,790
the application itself and there are few

690
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,150
pools available and there are a couple

691
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:29,230
of very good towards projects in this

692
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:32,800
particular aspect so for stream B this

693
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:36,610
was dependency check and was dependency

694
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,190
crack are the two main tool which are

695
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:42,149
available from us to help with that

696
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,150
particular stream

697
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:48,620
now let's look at the next stream which

698
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,699
is secure deployment on stream so next

699
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,350
if you practice which is secure

700
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,070
deployment

701
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,990
this particular practice focuses on

702
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,060
automatically securing deployments to a

703
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,850
production environment and all required

704
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,490
secrets one of the finest ease in

705
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,500
believing secure software is ensuring

706
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,370
that the security and integrity of

707
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,630
develop applications are not compromised

708
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:15,420
during the deployment

709
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:18,510
- this add this practices first stream

710
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:22,080
which is deployment process focuses on

711
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:24,120
removing manual error by automating the

712
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,659
deployment process as much as possible

713
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,060
and making its success contingent upon

714
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,560
the outcomes of integrated security

715
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,850
verification checks it also forces

716
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,860
separation of duties by making

717
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:41,029
adequately trained non developers

718
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,210
responsible for deployment

719
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,950
some organizations they have only

720
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,220
certain developers who are more in

721
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,469
DevOps roles they are responsible for

722
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,868
deployment

723
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,799
the second stream which is secrets

724
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:59,680
management goes beyond the mechanisms of

725
00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:02,589
deployment and focuses on protecting the

726
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:07,029
privacy and integrity of sensitive data

727
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:09,250
such as passwords tokens and other

728
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,120
secrets required for applications to

729
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,340
operate in production environments

730
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,770
in simplest form suitable production

731
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,680
secrets are moved from repositories and

732
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:23,100
configuration files into adequately

733
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,250
manage digital roles in more advanced

734
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,860
forms secrets are dynamically generated

735
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,730
and deployment time and routine

736
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:35,130
processes detect and mitigate the

737
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:38,250
presence of any unprotected secrets in

738
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,350
the environment and I am NOT here to

739
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,450
recommend any particular tool but there

740
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,660
are some tools available some of them

741
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,960
are open-source tools some of them are

742
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,700
build by various companies so you can

743
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,270
look at those tools to accomplish this

744
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,270
particular objective

745
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,390
now this slide I'm not going to dwell on

746
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,279
this slide too much because I already

747
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,170
have covered some of these suspects

748
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,270
during the motivations behind the new

749
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,640
version but this is a quick summary of

750
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,540
key changes that we introduced in Sam

751
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,089
version 2.0 I want to focus on the last

752
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,550
bullet which is on the measurement so

753
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:19,380
the difference between SEM 1.5 and to

754
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:22,829
auto is also on measurement

755
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,690
1.5 focus mainly on coverage based

756
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:29,519
measurement the 2.0 version focuses on

757
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:33,039
qualitative aspects in addition to

758
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:37,368
coverage business measurement

759
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:40,010
so after looking at all the changes that

760
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:43,819
we introduced in Porto as well as

761
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:47,510
introducing this overall model to folks

762
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:49,579
who are new let's spend some time on how

763
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,740
do you apply this model to your

764
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:54,470
particular ization

765
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:58,310
as I mentioned each organization is very

766
00:36:54,470 --> 00:37:01,549
unique in its own aspects especially

767
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:04,640
their risk profiles and their existing

768
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,530
level of maturity so it is very

769
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,879
important to start with preparation and

770
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,880
preparation goes beyond just doing the

771
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,560
assessment so preparation I'll talk

772
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,110
about preparation a little bit more in

773
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,410
detail in the next slide but at high

774
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:24,310
level typical rollout approach for Sam

775
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:27,100
includes six different phases

776
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,750
the first phase is prepare phase then

777
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,799
assessment

778
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:35,890
during the target defining the plant

779
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,530
implementation and rollout and this

780
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,290
curve again goes back to assessment thus

781
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,600
creating more of a cyclic process or

782
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,990
cyclic and continuous change improvement

783
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,990
process

784
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,750
so let's look at the first phase which

785
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,790
is the prepare phase

786
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,630
preface in my mind is the most critical

787
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:01,340
phase called success of Sam application

788
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:05,060
your particular organization

789
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,670
it consists of four activities the first

790
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,430
one is to define the scope so before

791
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,890
even you start to implementing Sam you

792
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:15,890
have to determine you want to apply Sam

793
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,740
to the whole organization a particular

794
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:23,230
business unit or some particular

795
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:26,020
applications or projects

796
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:29,079
the reason for that is the scope really

797
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:32,009
determines the amount of work it needs

798
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:35,650
to be done as well as what kind of

799
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,450
buying you need to receive so that is

800
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,640
what leads to the second one where once

801
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,549
you identify the scope of your

802
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,569
implementation you can identify the key

803
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:48,760
stakeholders and they vary from sport to

804
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,440
score because if you want to roll out

805
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,650
some Sam across your whole organization

806
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,950
you need to get buying from much higher

807
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,900
levels of leadership courses if you are

808
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,509
confining your scope to just particular

809
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,670
business unit then you need to take

810
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,609
buy-in from that particular business

811
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:12,280
units leadership team and if you are

812
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:15,578
doing it on that worker one particular

813
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,760
application or project then you just

814
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:21,030
have to get buying from that project

815
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,030
lead

816
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:26,440
but the key thing is once you define the

817
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:30,340
scope you need to get critical buying

818
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,830
from the leadership team

819
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,110
once you get the buy-in you need to

820
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:38,020
start spreading the world and do the

821
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:41,640
evangelization because that way you will

822
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,640
get lot more broader support

823
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,610
as part of preparation please review the

824
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:51,939
resources that we provided as part of

825
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:55,350
same version protocol guide for maturity

826
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:58,390
levels and defines objectives benefits

827
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:03,339
activities assessment questions quality

828
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:07,240
criteria success metrics and the cost

829
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:09,430
I was shown one example here so if you

830
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,109
look at this guide it's pretty

831
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:14,560
self-explanatory and as I mentioned

832
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:17,320
earlier that this guide has been created

833
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,799
with group of volunteers across the

834
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:24,580
globe who work at companies of different

835
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,070
sizes as well as academia so the

836
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,750
language is very neutral and it's very

837
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,210
self explanatory

838
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:37,150
spend some time in starting this guide

839
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,150
so you understand how to use them

840
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:43,640
after that you start doing the

841
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:45,680
assessment

842
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,600
in order to do the assessment you need

843
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,339
to start conducting interviews with key

844
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,558
stakeholders to evaluate the current

845
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,559
security practices

846
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:58,279
here we recommend the in person approach

847
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:00,619
versus emails this way you can explain

848
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:03,529
the key intent behind any activity and

849
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:05,739
clarify any potential doubts they may

850
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,739
have

851
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,470
there are three ways in which you can

852
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,300
perform an assessment

853
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,098
the lightweight assessment there is a

854
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,280
detail assessment and there is in a

855
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:17,420
hybrid assessment

856
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,510
lightweight assessment is simply

857
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,440
interviewing key stakeholders and

858
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:25,470
recording their response

859
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,859
during detailed assessment you asked for

860
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:34,649
evidence for performance and quality of

861
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:36,960
each activity being performed in the

862
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:39,960
hybrid assessment model you asked for

863
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,670
evidence only on a need basis for some

864
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,869
of the activities and not all of the

865
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:49,200
activities and at least from the most of

866
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:51,569
the practitioners and practitioners the

867
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,939
assessment takes a good amount of time

868
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:55,799
like it depending on your organization

869
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,780
or the scope that you choose

870
00:41:55,799 --> 00:42:01,240
it may take somewhere between oh one

871
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,310
hour to two to three hours

872
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,459
it really depends on what scope you are

873
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:09,029
trying to cover

874
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,410
so the most particular approach is the

875
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,410
hybrid assessment

876
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,670
now once you record the responses from

877
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,180
the key stakeholders and look at the

878
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,490
evidence

879
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:25,069
you can assign maturity levels using the

880
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:25,069
Sam spreadsheet that we poured it

881
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,520
you

882
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:32,489
one of the key thing about this Sam

883
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:35,910
spirit will curl a bit more in detail in

884
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:38,579
the next slide is how we have come up

885
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,499
with combined coverage based

886
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,769
measurements as well as quality based

887
00:42:40,499 --> 00:42:45,839
measurement as I mentioned each degree

888
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:49,379
package needs to be assessed on those to

889
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,229
access coverage as well as quality so

890
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:55,019
let's look at the example of spreadsheet

891
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:57,169
or the worksheet that we have built for

892
00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:00,200
version 2 Auto

893
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,990
as you can see in the previous version

894
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,689
we just had the question for example if

895
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,129
this was an assessment for 1.5 it would

896
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,819
have been the question new test

897
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:13,010
applications for correct functioning of

898
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:15,529
standard security controls now in

899
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:18,950
version 2.0 the way we have added this

900
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:23,990
quality criteria are clubbed together

901
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:26,270
with the question so if you say no for

902
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,540
any of this quality criteria or if you

903
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:31,160
do not meet any of the quality criteria

904
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:34,880
the answer for the question should

905
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,129
simply be no you cannot have yes if you

906
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,700
do not meet the quality criteria that is

907
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,540
how we added the second dimension of

908
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,740
measurement in this particular

909
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:48,740
assessment and the key goal here was we

910
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:52,160
a lot of debate when we are deciding on

911
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,500
this one and we went back to this some

912
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,250
of these sandport principles and one of

913
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,990
the core principle is simplicity so as a

914
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,559
result we decided to add quality

915
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:05,299
criteria for each question this way time

916
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,880
to complete an assessment did not

917
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:10,970
significantly increase with sample dotto

918
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,460
and this was the key thing which helped

919
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,669
us guide in making this decision because

920
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,359
we did not want to create this very long

921
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:23,569
and laborious activity that is why we

922
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:25,930
added simplicity and we added this

923
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:29,480
quality criteria to the existing

924
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:31,930
question which was aim to cover the

925
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,930
coverage

926
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,660
all mature score for the security

927
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,500
practice is calculated by taking the

928
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:46,040
average of maturity level one between

929
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:48,380
stream a and screen B and adding that

930
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,840
the level of maturity at level two and

931
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,240
level three and once you add all of this

932
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:57,040
you come up with the rating for that

933
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,040
basically practice

934
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:04,149
once you finish the assessment

935
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,980
you need to define the target as per

936
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:09,280
business drivers and the risk profile

937
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:11,200
for your organization now the most

938
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,410
important thing over here is to estimate

939
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,109
the cost so on average it takes about

940
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:19,930
five to ten percent higher cost for

941
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:22,690
every level of maturity when you try to

942
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,460
increase every level of maturity it

943
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,430
takes about five to ten percent higher

944
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:30,280
costs we do not have concrete data but

945
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:33,129
this is based on most of the Sam

946
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,650
petitioners feedback this is the rough

947
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,050
estimate so you need to keep that cost

948
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,090
in mind as well and this costs again

949
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:43,270
varies from organization to organization

950
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:47,250
there is profile as well as the existing

951
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,250
level of maturity so keep that in mind

952
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,369
once you set the target you can define

953
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,380
the plant and in order to do that first

954
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:57,320
you need to determine the chain schedule

955
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,690
as per the upcoming release and develop

956
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:03,110
and update roadmap plan for the next

957
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:05,240
four or five phases now this phase wise

958
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,580
approach is also good for from the

959
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,799
change management perspective and what

960
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,830
we recommend is no less than three

961
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,250
phases and no more than five phases to

962
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,110
roll out Sam

963
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,290
we also recommend that you start with

964
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:23,950
the most impactful security practices

965
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:27,360
such as training in awareness and site

966
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,359
assessment in the first phase

967
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,779
once plan is defined start the

968
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:37,599
implementation

969
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:39,880
implement activities using sample auto

970
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,880
guide that we have worded as part of the

971
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,939
resources leverage other Sam projects

972
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,749
Sam aspires to be an umbrella project of

973
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:52,629
all samples so always projects and what

974
00:46:49,749 --> 00:46:55,209
it means is what Sam project can map

975
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:58,179
back to one of these Sam business

976
00:46:55,209 --> 00:47:00,729
functions and security practice so we

977
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:04,010
want to have this mapping done as part

978
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:05,660
of future directions

979
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,790
and here are some of the example or

980
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,680
voice projects and how they map back to

981
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,590
various same business functions and

982
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,580
security practices so as you can see

983
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:19,250
some of the worst projects edges was top

984
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,140
ten that can map to multiples and

985
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,890
business functions and not just one

986
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,890
business function

987
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,960
after implementation we need to create

988
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:34,599
and update scorecards on regular

989
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,660
interval by capturing scores from before

990
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,910
and after an iteration of assurance

991
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,399
program build out and communicate this

992
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,288
progress to the management the key thing

993
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,349
over here is communication and again

994
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:50,920
this phases they have lost somewhere

995
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:53,650
between three months to 12 months 1215

996
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:58,359
months so it again depends on the scope

997
00:47:53,650 --> 00:48:01,359
of roll-off the phase can be can last

998
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:04,509
about 3 months or it can last up to 12

999
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,339
months as well but the key thing is you

1000
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:09,989
need to communicate the progress to the

1001
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:09,989
senior management on regular intervals

1002
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,049
now here are some of the available

1003
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:20,250
resources which have to get you started

1004
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:23,130
using Sampo all these resources are

1005
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:24,660
linked to our Sam to our G website so if

1006
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,720
you forget everything

1007
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,779
just remember one website over time dot

1008
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,600
o-r-g all the resources are linked to

1009
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,900
that particular website so loo visit

1010
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,118
that website

1011
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,099
and one more thing sand benchmark

1012
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,700
initiative so what is sem benchmark

1013
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:44,180
initiative

1014
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:48,160
it helps answer the question how do I

1015
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,868
compare to other organizations

1016
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,118
if you remember we discussed on others

1017
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:55,270
operations maturity framework earlier

1018
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:57,520
during this talk called vision same

1019
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,549
benchmark initiative is inspired by

1020
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,829
vision be seen does really good job at

1021
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:06,009
providing comparison with other secure

1022
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:08,079
auditions the goal of this project is to

1023
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:11,109
collect most comprehensive data set

1024
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:14,960
related to all organization maturity of

1025
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:17,180
application also physical programs

1026
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,690
this data should come from both

1027
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,069
self-assessing organizations and

1028
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,670
consultancies that perform third-party

1029
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,670
assessments

1030
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:31,379
we understand privacy is key here

1031
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,380
because many organization may not want

1032
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:38,099
to reveal their level of maturity or

1033
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,460
immaturity to rest of the world keeping

1034
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:45,540
that in mind or data collection process

1035
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:48,300
will be anonymous and we will make sure

1036
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:51,300
that privacy is always at the forefront

1037
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,360
when we collect this data

1038
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,360
you

1039
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:01,800
so before finishing this talk just quick

1040
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:04,650
highlight on what is the future for Sam

1041
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,010
so Sam will continue like the previous

1042
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:11,820
version we are able to have smaller and

1043
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,880
faster iterative versions version 2.1

1044
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:18,980
2.3 so on so forth in fact we just

1045
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,980
embarked on ch CD ourself

1046
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,850
the second one as I mentioned earlier is

1047
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:28,710
the references to otherwise projects

1048
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:32,400
because we envision Sam being more of an

1049
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:35,250
umbrella project under us and all of us

1050
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,740
project can map back to one of the Sam

1051
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,110
business functions so we will definitely

1052
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,319
provide more references to other wise

1053
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:44,719
projects

1054
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,179
and last but not least is it's a very

1055
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:50,029
aspirational goal of making this

1056
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:54,579
assessment and roadmap creation more of

1057
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:58,279
an online process that would really help

1058
00:50:54,579 --> 00:51:01,699
design this to match the moon more

1059
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:04,150
modern software applications itself

1060
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:06,799
currently if you can see you have to

1061
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:09,259
download some of these resources such as

1062
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:11,900
the spreadsheet which would call it

1063
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:16,130
worksheet to do the assessment and

1064
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,219
create road maps eventually we aspire to

1065
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:22,069
make all of these things through online

1066
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:24,609
assessment and online road map creation

1067
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:24,609
templates

1068
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,630
having said that I the key call for

1069
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:35,370
action here is to start using Sam

1070
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:37,410
Stemper Auto and somebody says proof of

1071
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:40,049
the pudding is in trying it so I really

1072
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:42,720
asked everybody over here to start using

1073
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,030
Sam 2.2 and if you have any question you

1074
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,609
can always reach out to me and others

1075
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,320
Sam volunteers and also you can reach

1076
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,140
out to us for any feedback you might

1077
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,480
have

1078
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,060
thank you

1079
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,040
Thank You Hardy we will go into a short

1080
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:02,200
break and then we will be right back

1081
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,200
