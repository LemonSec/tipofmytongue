1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:10,830
if you have a good watch or a TI

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:12,030
calculator okay here are the categories

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,000
for this round

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,160
do I hear an echo voice assistance by

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,539
their name to their owner and

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,900
manufacturer will name the voice

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,210
assistant you name the manufacturer

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:29,729
Google droppings these are products that

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:32,308
have been abandoned by Google founding

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,200
figures big names in the time of the

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,820
bulky pipes the cloud wars cloud

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,550
services that have overlapped with

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:46,530
common military designations computer

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,510
without acronyms all the answers are

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,370
common acronyms but you have to expand

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,160
it so you can't say the afternoon you

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,209
have to stay the full thing alright

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,190
and lastly o mas top tips you'll name -

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,800
Oh must category for the popular

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,170
vulnerability classes all right we'll

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,280
always start with team one so that's PD

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,200
maybe you have the board and yes

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,270
everybody will need to have the mics up

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,740
and it does whoever buzzes I'll

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,060
acknowledge e when they hand the mic to

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:27,839
the whoever's gonna answer 200 do I hear

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:31,030
an echo 200 Alexa misfit toys form of a

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,920
question correct

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:37,690
but give me a couple of those before we

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:47,410
start doing yeah okay misfits you got

31
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:49,840
porn okay in a room full of nerds

32
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,509
that's a heart okay see a cloud war is

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,570
1000 Google service that can perform

34
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:59,260
cryptographic operations on FIPS 140-2

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,940
level 3 certified modules not us in

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,140
helicopter squadrons that perform

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,140
anti-submarine warfare

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:29,920
what is Google HSM hardware security

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:31,179
module this one routes our HSM - but

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,018
they're but they're called helicopter

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:39,239
maritime sprink yeah strike

42
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,239
ok misfits you still have the board

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,519
penalty fingers 400 ok famously created

44
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,739
hundreds of cryptographic bombs that

45
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,900
search for valid settings on an enigma

46
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,900
message misfits

47
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:17,250
all right this is the twins yes

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,260
this service provides a social network

49
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,390
for its users

50
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,370
unlike only fathom let's new potential

51
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,540
intervention elites and the famous

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:34,860
cover-up decent example 2019 misfits

53
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,340
correct just X maybe they forced it on

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,080
us

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:44,010
they think that information and they

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:46,560
drive here we go 400 this service helps

57
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,170
users organize and digital photos it was

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:56,390
discontinued at 2016 to focus efforts on

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:04:03,690
Google photos misfits correct

60
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:04,619
okay word 600 Google droppings this

61
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,090
much-maligned

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,820
wearable device was cancelled for

63
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,709
consumer use in 2015 but not before a

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:26,880
new pejorative was created to describe

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:34,620
its users this yeah we will take that

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:38,159
yeah yeah Google glass right 800 dual

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,510
iraqis this service provided a personal

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,330
web portal for users to access

69
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,520
customized content in one place using

70
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,710
various gadgets like many other Google

71
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,180
services it was canned to focus on

72
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,180
Google+ in 2013

73
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,810
I used this one extensively and I was

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,770
very sad when it went away

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,900
it was I google Tiger go down

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,510
apparently not enough people used it I

77
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,190
was very upset okay

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:17,860
miss miss you still have for this

79
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,420
service a successor to dodgeball allowed

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,430
users to share their location with

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,430
people it was canceled in 2013

82
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:43,070
what is Google Latitude lattice here

83
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:47,750
okay yes so this busy stop work cloud

84
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:50,389
wars 200 Google's database service to

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,820
store and sync data in real time not to

86
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:58,210
be confused with in canvas that provide

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:20,300
our artillery support government shills

88
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:24,229
incorrect misfits incorrect thank you

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,010
for our military expert at down here he

90
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:33,280
plays a lot of military video gamers

91
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,280
okay it was a firebase firebase I

92
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:44,570
believe misfits you start the board why

93
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:46,580
not Microsoft simplified to Venegas

94
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:51,469
cloud service not to be confused with

95
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,389
the airborne variant of the ak-74 not a

96
00:06:51,470 --> 00:07:04,939
k47

97
00:06:53,389 --> 00:07:08,979
that'd be scary to be everyone ok time

98
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:11,870
what is a KS after kubernetes service

99
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:15,378
stop like you know you must experience

100
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:21,530
all these things ok

101
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:36,349
misfit okay here we go

102
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:42,460
Cortana misfits correct misfits yeah 400

103
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:44,960
ok computer with a hybrid X 400 as

104
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,229
opposed to its dynamic cannot require

105
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,948
this volatile storage service device

106
00:07:48,229 --> 00:08:06,680
does not need to be refreshed government

107
00:07:51,949 --> 00:08:16,909
chills you got the buzzer but also yeah

108
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:19,870
it has to be said misfit toys that's

109
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,870
incorrect

110
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,099
the points for just trying to take on

111
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:40,069
they're a long way of answering that's

112
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:44,510
always what a static random-access

113
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:52,339
memory okay this is you still have a

114
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:54,410
Bordeaux cloud Morris 400 deeply

115
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,959
discounted instances that might be

116
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,910
preempted by DC tunity the tools for

117
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:12,040
which might get confused with the senior

118
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:17,930
member of a sniper team misfits

119
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,560
incorrect don't celebrations give me

120
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,560
answer long

121
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:32,389
it's like the Bucks are celebrating

122
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:34,579
their falling down to the ring alright

123
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,579
calling it yeah

124
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:45,069
what is Amazon spot instances and the

125
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:45,069
tool is AWS spotters spotters so misfits

126
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,809
yeah okay here we go on print AWS

127
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,379
service fully managed and maintained by

128
00:09:53,809 --> 00:10:00,759
AWS not a detachment of troops distantly

129
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,759
station from the main force

130
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:18,300
it doesn't help if there's like 500

131
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:28,760
tools in AWS okay the answer was AWS

132
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:32,099
outposts all right misfits 200 computing

133
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:37,220
originally released in 1996 commonly

134
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:41,090
used to attach peripherals Misfits

135
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,090
that's correct okay

136
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,310
600 this technology is typically used to

137
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,940
increase reliability for performance of

138
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,180
two or more mass storage devices darish

139
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,180
hills

140
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:08,040
you know

141
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,140
that is incorrect

142
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,870
[Music]

143
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:53,780
yeah it is for ice not devices okay okay

144
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,030
this vulnerability allows an attacker to

145
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,430
use an otherwise benign web applications

146
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,060
in malicious code generally in the form

147
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,640
of JavaScript to a different end user

148
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:07,510
gamma shows what is an XSS acrostics

149
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,510
will correct

150
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:19,880
okay what I'm governor sickles okay this

151
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,500
technique is used to stick untrusted

152
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:32,660
data through an interpreter as part of

153
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:33,950
the command or query that's acceptable

154
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,390
yeah what does it it may also want to

155
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:47,120
accept such as injection but that's

156
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:49,430
that's good because I mean it's this

157
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
attack relies on an on and off finicky

158
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,630
common and authenticated users

159
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,709
submitting an HTTP request on the

160
00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:00,780
attackers the Hat dispensed what is

161
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,860
or cross-site request forgery awesome

162
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,860
you guys are above and beyond us

163
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:17,910
misfits you have together get bored okay

164
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,560
in application server administrative

165
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,390
interface that is automatically

166
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,849
installed with well-known credentials

167
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:40,890
and not removed is an example of visible

168
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:42,570
our ability yes I think we have to say

like oh okay mines different these types

421
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:48,330
of buttons are free because they came

422
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:55,070
built into the circuit board became a

423
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:57,660
building yeah misfits what is capacitive

424
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,450
yeah that's correct yeah capacitive

425
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,569
sticks or capacitive buttons together

426
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,649
correct

427
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,650
all right this goods you haven't worth

428
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,980
all right 600 batch are this powerful

429
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,080
component makes sure that the badge

430
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,080
circuit always has 3.3 volts

431
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:32,730
he's supposed to bridge later yeah yeah

432
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:38,960
the power regulator our linear regulator

433
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,960
yes the battery definitely provides the

434
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:54,960
but I can provide more all right

435
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:56,999
Elizabeth 800 yeah magic hundred this

436
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:29,380
type of power source has a voltage range

437
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:32,149
of forces I'm sorry that is correct

438
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,829

no okay

442
00:40:49,249 --> 00:41:09,269
misfits you have the board 200 smallest

443
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:17,249
deployable object kubernetes definitely

444
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:19,578
not a spec you should be asking us sorry

445
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:19,578
that's incorrect

446
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,149

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,660
online of the guys like it's a virtual

451
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:47,999
machine I'd know how to fix this that's

452
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:50,440
how I container it's what is a pot up I

453
00:41:47,999 --> 00:42:00,730
don't want any pies and they are the

454
00:41:50,440 --> 00:42:02,920
smallest winner directory within one or

455
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,049
more containers that bypasses the Union

456
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:13,749
filesystem though it won't help measure

457
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:15,369
the size of the container it kind of

458
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,720
makes it kind of makes me happy that

459
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,130
nobody element like I'm not the only

460
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:31,689
person in the world

461

what is it Polly no it doesn't when an

462
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:38,220
attacker controls the majority of the

463
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:38,220
network hash rate Cellular

464
00:42:52,490 --> 00:43:02,060
hey it's human yeah makes it more fun at

465
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:02,060
the time also more merciful

472
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,329
of work system used by Bitcoin

473
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,160
originally designed to look at email

474
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:06,559
spam and prevent denial of service

475
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,558
attacks not form of nominal currency

476
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:38,059
okay what is hashcash okay chaos yeah

477
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:40,569
the type of encoding used for Bitcoin

478

incorrect

482
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:32,280
what is space 58 it's a big anything can

483
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:42,520
be a base to it right

484
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:49,270
okay chaos the number of bits are mighty

485
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:56,380
room dual-core processor uses 16 is

486
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:58,480
incorrect this bits 32 in the form of a

487
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,810
question on it's 32 minutes that's

488
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,810
correct

489

that's right

490
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:23,150
okay this is enough for 600 natively

491
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:28,009
managed cluster of docker Nations I hope

492
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:38,600
you didn't don't get overwhelmed yes

493
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:40,640
what a swarm we got one okay 800 this

494
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,350
kubernetes agent that runs on each node

495
00:46:40,640 --> 00:47:07,990
and the cluster might be got your
