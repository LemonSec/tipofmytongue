1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:13,769
we have a problem and the best way for

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,360
me to explain this problem is to bring

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:21,900
the League of Legends game into the

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:25,289
myths now by raise of hands who here has

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,229
heard of League of Legends okay also we

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,170
got awesome crowd I can drop a few guys

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:37,380
who here has played it ok maybe not so

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:48,180
much maybe you played a similar game

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:51,059
maybe Starcraft 2 or maybe none of this

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,620
applies to you but you've worked with a

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,559
group of human beings before okay good

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,349
and we all can get them off and you can

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,890
understand this story this story took

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,390
place after an exhausting day at work

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,030
one thing that I like to do

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,119
tell me whine down this play League of

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,060
Legends game and now essentially what

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:20,040
League of Legends is is a strategy game

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,320
and the whole point of the match is to

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,610
take down the Nexus which is the enemy

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,770
base there are only two ways to win the

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,750
game one you take down the enemy base

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:38,460
two you forfeit the match or you

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,369
surrender when a team dies or when a

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,460
player dies you can respond you can come

26
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,820
back it depends on how late in the game

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,000
it is and that depends on how long your

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,779
timer is to come back

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,330
the game doesn't end when you die I knew

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,200
this and so I open up the game in I have

31
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,990
a strategy

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,680
I have things planned out when I usually

33
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:09,160
have things planned out but this time

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,490
posting the perfect tunnel vision when

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:16,210
the world around me slips away and the

36
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,870
game is all I can see or think about ok

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:24,400
so this is me talking to myself

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:27,280
focus on helping your teammates protect

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,810
the ADC which is the high-damage player

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,950
of the match which is a port of player

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,950
like I was was tasked with protecting oh

42
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,950
and keep an eye on enemy players and

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,950
then out of the corner of my eye in the

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,519
in-game map on the side I see a teammate

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,670
of mine chasing after another player in

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,410
enemy territory with no visibility into

47
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:56,170
the me area basically into their jungle

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,390
one characteristic of a jungle in real

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,500
life is that it's dense you can't see

50
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,869
past a certain point and this is the

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,000
same for leap you can't see past a

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,500
certain point it so he was basically

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,989
going there blind

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,020
and the reason why was because he was

55
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:16,230
strong he saw month larry's uh-uh I got

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,060
it I'll be fine

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,140
because moments before in the match he

58
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,200
ain't got a lot of kills and with every

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,690
kill it was a risky

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,488
it's a risky play but like all of us

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,040
when we make a risky play what happens

62
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,200
to us when we make a risky play we win

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,079
we hear like okay I got this

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,518
I'm good so we make another risky play

65
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,440
and we're fine if we develop an ego and

66
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:49,080
this is what happened ten he develops an

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:55,079
ego so you went after the plate and he

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:58,260
does classic rookie mistake we all make

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,160
them but I don't have to talk to this

70
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:08,190
this match was important to me I wanted

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,900
to win so I decided to say what all my

72
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,799
teammates were saying but a much nicer

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,798
way I mean granted I felt my teammates

74
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:22,079
frustration but instead of calling them

75
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,870
a mother-loving piece of shirt I decided

76
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:31,320
to follow my own personal rules and her

77
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:34,970
a real nice message yeah well that was a

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,620
play but we really need you in the match

79
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,039
you're one of my strongest players so

80
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,770
let's not do that it was to know what

81
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,039
though

82
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:50,400
he just kept making one risky play after

83
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,669
the other and instead of each risky play

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:59,539
being a risky play it became a list of

85
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,539
rookie mistakes one after the other I

86
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,659
was beyond frustrated at this point I

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,969
want to win this match he didn't have to

88
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,389
take every single piece of advice that I

89
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,580
told him all he had to do was follow one

90
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,710
piece of the bust

91
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,550
you know cuz the whole objective of this

92
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,060
match

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,060
it's a be an actual contributing plate

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:42,230
enemy double kill in a niche triple kill

95
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:42,230
enemy Quadra kill enemy Penta kill

96
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:52,230
that's around I realize it we all had I

97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:59,190
see that I was tasked with protecting

98
00:05:52,230 --> 00:06:01,740
had uh and naturally my team's annoyance

99
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,590
which was first on the rookie mistakes

100
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,590
player shifted to me and right Felicia

101
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,060
because I wasn't protecting the team

102
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:19,890
because of rookie mistakes player in I

103
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:25,469
were similarly the same while he was in

104
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:29,570
his own tunnel vision so was i moments

105
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:33,240
before our team's I I was so frustrated

106
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,670
with him and his rookie mistakes I was

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,620
so distracted by my annoyances with him

108
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:43,850
that I forgot my role in the team in my

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,250
team was on the other side of the map

110
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,920
getting killed by enemy players one

111
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,470
after the other and by the time I got

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,700
there it was too late I couldn't help

113
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:01,970
them and thus the rookie mistakes player

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:06,500
and I were guilty of the same crime

115
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:10,260
because I also lost sight of the goal

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,560
the goal wasn't to play perfectly and

117
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:18,900
everyone play on this artificial even a

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:26,430
superior level the goal

119
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:31,169
what to attack the enemy Nexus as a team

120
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:35,080
the best teams are the ones the lot more

121
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,460
energy towards their own individual

122
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,090
performance rather than micromanaging

123
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,729
someone else's

124
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,520
they offer a helpful perspective when

125
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:52,710
something goes wrong and then go on

126
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:56,979
about the task at hand in cybersecurity

127
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:01,020
the end user is in there while the end

128
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,780
user is in there tunnel vision so are we

129
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,969
we so often focus on our annoyances and

130
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,940
frustrations with them that we forget

131
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,250
that we are also a part of the problem

132
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,250
we also can make mistakes

133
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:25,600
the rookie mistakes player wasn't a bad

134
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,929
player they were actually a very capable

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,080
very strong player they just made a

136
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,080
mistake

137
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,610
so what happened

138
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,900
we told him what we needed from him as a

139
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:50,460
team we emphasized that he was vital to

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:57,380
the match and we gave him a game plan

141
00:08:50,460 --> 00:09:04,140
using our strengths and we win the game

142
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:06,530
yes not all games go like this but some

143
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,530
of them do

144
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:20,220
similarly in cybersecurity the end user

145
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:24,900
isn't a bad player they're a very strong

146
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:28,820
very capable player they just have

147
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:33,980
moments maybe more moments than we do

148
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,980
but they're still strong and by

149
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,660
when we're talking to end-users when an

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,910
incident happens in may trigger an alert

151
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:51,410
and we're upset for the X amount of time

152
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,709
before you talk to them have a game plan

153
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,860
okay

154
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:02,220
you're frustrated take a walk around the

155
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:04,680
campus take a deep breath tell them what

156
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,930
you need from them as a team or a part

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,050
of the team every single person the team

158
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,910
is tasked with protecting their allies

159
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,540
and protecting their own Nexus there in

160
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,540
a third base

161
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:27,180
emphasize their vital role tell them

162
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:31,050
what you need from them say hey you know

163
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:34,279
what this is my job I'm a security

164
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:37,829
professional this is why my job exists

165
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:40,950
and what we need from everyone in the

166
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,700
team are in the world we're gonna go

167
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,370
that big is that everyone plays their on

168
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,770
the role we're human and we make

169
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,209
mistakes Innes okay but make sure they

170
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,529
know that they're a part of the team

171
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:57,439
you're not leaving them out you're not

172
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,439
making them feel like they're inferior

173
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,380
fess up to being human to be open no one

174
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,900
wants to talk to someone who's

175
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,990
infectious if you did something wrong

176
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,540
and someone came to you it's like yeah I

177
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,890
never made that

178
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,310
we're not going to feel really good

179
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:23,170
about listening to them so be open when

180
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:26,859
you're talking to them I believe our

181
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:31,269
attitude towards end users is doing a

182
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:34,690
disservice to our ultimate goal because

183
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:38,350
ultimately what do we want a more secure

184
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:40,420
world a more secure future but we can't

185
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,510
do that if we alienate some of our

186
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:48,579
teammates we can't do that if we make

187
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,410
someone feel inferior we can't do that

188
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,209
if we're distracted by our own

189
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:58,260
annoyances and frustrations with the

190
00:11:52,209 --> 00:12:00,630
routines days play like I was and as

191
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:06,670
cheesy as it sounds

192
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:10,510
we're all a part of a team fighting for

193
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:15,160
a world where our security our privacy

194
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:18,310
is taken seriously and we can't afford

195
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:23,230
to keep toxic mentalities about what an

196
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:26,920
end user is or isn't we will be

197
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,550
frustrated and users we will want to

198
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,060
curse them out and we will want to shout

199
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,899
and yell I'm having an ID 10t error over

200
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,369
here idiot and flip the desk I'm pretty

201
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:41,440
sure all of you want to success every

202
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,029
day but we definitely want to put the

203
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,350
desk with someone triggers of alert

204
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:51,670
again but

205
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:55,630
you can't but I'm saying we can't

206
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,760
because there are part of the team maybe

207
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,530
you don't have the capacity to guide

208
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,990
someone maybe you're not that person

209
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,730
that can walk around the campus take a

210
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,270
deep breath and then talk to the end

211
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,520
user and say hey I'm on your side maybe

212
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,740
that's not you that doesn't have to be

213
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,370
you maybe that's me that's what I'd like

214
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,350
to do you can pass it on to someone who

215
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:23,140
likes to do it but if you have to do it

216
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,740
consider your game plan consider the end

217
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,880
goal

218
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,750
what do you ultimately want and let's

219
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,760
not let our annoyances and frustrations

220
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,460
take over us like it didn't be in the

221
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,700
game when we lose sight of the ball so

222
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,600
much that we can't see what's in front

223
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:45,760
of us the strong and vital player who

224
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:53,260
makes mistakes who may not know security

225
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:57,819
I believe it's time that we treat each

226
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:02,410
other like we are all human and part of

227
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:04,800
a bigger team let's talk about being

228
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,800
human

229
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,970
I'm gonna ask you a question and you

230
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,600
don't have to raise your hands for this

231
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:17,910
question but if you want to feel free

232
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:22,889
have you ever been made to feel like you

233
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:26,189
were inadequate not smart or not good

234
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:29,639
enough I'm gonna be vulnerable yes

235
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:32,219
that's me and if you haven't that let me

236
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,379
be you for a day because I'm pretty sure

237
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,549
that would be nice actually it's not

238
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,910
because then you wouldn't know your

239
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,910
strengths

240
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,760
everybody has someone in their life that

241
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,260
has made them feel this way it could

242
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,270
have been a parent thankfully wasn't

243
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,490
blind but it could be your parents it

244
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,360
could be your friends your bosses your

245
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,690
co-workers how does it make you feel to

246
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,610
talk to this person do you feel yeah

247
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,360
they came to me for another day to tell

248
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,970
me to do another task I like them I'm

249
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,459
gonna do it cuz they make me feel really

250
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:22,810
inadequate you know you don't because we

251
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:25,510
hate being around them because they make

252
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,949
us feel like we're stupid and you know

253
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,140
what they may have never said anything

254
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,720
to you about being stupid or inadequate

255
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,430
you may have never heard anything

256
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,310
through the grapevine about them

257
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:39,250
thinking you're stupid but the way that

258
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,040
they act towards you makes you know and

259
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,770
feel that you just know they feel like

260
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,910
you don't belong that someone else

261
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:52,510
should be in your place because our

262
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,899
thoughts affect how we treat people it

263
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:00,540
affects how we have conversations it

264
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:05,980
affects our jokes it affects I contact

265
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:10,029
our micro smiles and micro frowns they

266
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,910
all affect us and what I'm saying to you

267
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:17,560
is that the way we think about it users

268
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,790
effects end users because if we feel and

269
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,199
we constantly say that they're

270
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,120
inadequate they become an advocate

271
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,339
because that's how they feel whether

272
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:31,690
they know it or not I'm not saying

273
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:34,690
everyone but I'm saying one thing that I

274
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,329
had to realize while doing security

275
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:41,550
awareness trainings and well caught

276
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:43,329
while talking to coaching clients or

277
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,899
creating security awareness training

278
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:50,469
modules is that one thing we have to

279
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,860
really understand is that not everyone

280
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,470
knows

281
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,990
security and we're going to a few

282
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,090
examples of my stories with that not

283
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,040
everyone knows that so when you're

284
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,430
talking to them or when you're thinking

285
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,940
about them or you're talking about fun

286
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,139
see to understand your their situation

287
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,930
Geor have your brands we need to have

288
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,240
our events we need to get it out for in

289
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,670
front of them on our training ourselves

290
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,710
how to speak and how to talk about them

291
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,040
so that when we go to them we give them

292
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:25,180
the best information to understand their

293
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:29,260
situation does their whole job involve

294
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:32,650
clicking on links there's this lady who

295
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:36,190
her entire job is to click those links

296
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,130
and open attachments and if I go to her

297
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,330
and tell her do you know this person you

298
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,880
shouldn't click on that because you

299
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,810
don't know if the IVA doesn't even look

300
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,030
right to you

301
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:48,070
it's not gonna work for her because if

302
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,030
she doesn't click and she does respond

303
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:54,790
to client emails and she doesn't provide

304
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:58,300
amazing customer service as well she

305
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,940
loses her job her mortgages get paid for

306
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,870
kids don't need so when you say don't

307
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:10,720
click on that link goes because mortgage

308
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:13,090
says click on that link are they

309
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,880
confused with the exact steps to take in

310
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,740
certain situations maybe they know about

311
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,510
security talk to me more like you I've

312
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,950
heard on the news I know Facebook is

313
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,990
doing whatever they're doing with the

314
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,920
privacy and yeah I understand that but

315
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,550
what do I do if I click on a link what's

316
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,880
the next step maybe they understand it

317
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,560
but in a certain situation it doesn't

318
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,300
they don't understand exactly the steps

319
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:43,840
to take who to call may you be either a

320
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,600
person wants a ton on their plate I talk

321
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,570
to a lot of families and small business

322
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,540
owners who are like yeah Security's

323
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,439
great they're mostly concerned

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:58,310
but God like I have to worry about rent

325
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,870
I gotta worry about keeping my job

326
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:04,169
security is like that's great but is it

327
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,120
gonna give me money if it's not I don't

328
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,390
want it it's not going to keep my child

329
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:13,800
safe in the physical sense I just hope

330
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:16,290
they don't get cyber bully maybe they

331
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,899
have no idea what security is and why it

332
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,629
matters I was having this conversation

333
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,280
with this small business owner which is

334
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,950
having casual conversation was nothing

335
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,170
like it was for my business and I just

336
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,210
mentioned what I do I said hey you know

337
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,910
I do cyber sphere coaching and then

338
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,710
she's like what if I was skating that

339
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,960
was the first time someone asked me in

340
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,760
that situation what is cybersecurity and

341
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,940
I'm used to people who know it but they

342
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,710
don't know all of the details in it so I

343
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,690
had to sit there and explain what type

344
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:54,480
of security is in its essence what I do

345
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:57,390
why it matters why it matters to hurt me

346
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,690
either well aware of what to do and this

347
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:03,210
distracted there are you there me and

348
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,530
this is one of my favorite Twitter

349
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:10,110
stories and I got her permission so

350
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,670
don't freak out and I'm sharing it

351
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,500
because I think this is one of the best

352
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,840
things I've ever seen on Twitter hands

353
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:21,180
down this is tara some of you may know

354
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,370
her she's a white hat hacker

355
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:28,440
she's a pen tester she knows security

356
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:30,120
really well and she says I just fell for

357
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,430
a phishing email on someone else's

358
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,209
account they asked me to look at you

359
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:39,510
never saw me type so fast to change a

360
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,540
password harder trick hammering in my

361
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,900
chest I got extremely lucky next time

362
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,200
maybe not so much very disappointing to

363
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,020
an otherwise victorious week what does

364
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,360
she do here she's vulnerable as someone

365
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,760
in for her position she's vulnerable as

366
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,310
someone who positioned that off who says

367
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,470
oh gosh these people click on links all

368
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,889
the time I never do that I'm perfect I

369
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,000
never had something go wrong when I was

370
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:12,530
playing around the malware nothing

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,530
happened said no one ever

372
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:23,300
she admitted it this is huge because

373
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:27,120
when you or I admit this on Twitter I

374
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,490
don't think so she goes on to say that

375
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,689
it was a she gives context to it so she

376
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,610
was saying as a personal account on

377
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,020
someone's PC before anyone freaked out

378
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,800
on Twitter she said it wasn't worth

379
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,260
work-related

380
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:43,860
and she gave them security steps to

381
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,020
integrate into their life so that next

382
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,639
time something happens or doesn't happen

383
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:53,520
because they have certain things in

384
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,020
place they know what to do and then she

385
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,510
goes into everything that she did to

386
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,129
remediate the problem she changed her

387
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,020
passwords and Crouse all the counts in

388
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,550
case they had multiple passwords because

389
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:08,700
no one feels like dealing with passwords

390
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:12,180
I believe that we should all be like

391
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,950
Tara now when I asked her to put this up

392
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:19,080
she said we shouldn't but we should

393
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:23,130
that's a little point of my keynote but

394
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,370
we should because we aren't immune and

395
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,750
we make mistakes I make mistakes

396
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,419
sometimes that phishing email looks

397
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,170
really good like really the package came

398
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,170
gosh at the wave

399
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,409
that was a point of the first story and

400
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,460
this is going to be the point for the

401
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:46,110
second story that we are human that's

402
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:52,530
not that's we are human

403
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:56,908
okay yeah see I make mistakes I'm going

404
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,260
to ask you a question and this time you

405
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:03,510
can definitely raise your hands I

406
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:05,640
encourage you do you think that the

407
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,510
thoughts that you have inside of your

408
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:18,299
head could influence how someone moves

409
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:20,090
through space do you think the thoughts

410
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,408
that you have inside of your head

411
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,658
influence how someone moves through

412
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:28,820
space and you can internally and analyze

413
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,820
it or answer it but I do

414
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,629
we're going to go back to that question

415
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,850
but for right now I'm going to take

416
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:45,260
another deep dive into a league game and

417
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:48,330
take you along your journey with me I

418
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,220
remember the first time I did terribly

419
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,970
on a champion which is a player

420
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,920
controlled character that was good at

421
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,780
granted it was late at night and I've

422
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
been playing more than a few games or

423
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,840
shut up

424
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,410
but either way he's playing badly

425
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,030
doesn't feel good

426
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,490
remember my personal rule in the

427
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,350
beginning if you don't is fine where I

428
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,330
don't talk badly about my teammates I

429
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,840
don't curse them out in my head I do but

430
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:22,710
not on the paper it probably came from

431
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:26,909
one of these moments I cannot believe I

432
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:31,700
have another no brain character or

433
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:34,890
player in my dimension this moment came

434
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:39,840
after a bad mistake bad move on my part

435
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,630
I was new to the game my bed shut the

436
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,899
whole Cup you know damn well you must

437
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:51,960
late that and I have to sit here and

438
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:55,830
deal with your shirt players internalize

439
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,790
their comments too much because I knew

440
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:02,669
that patronizing someone and tearing

441
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,480
them down doesn't exactly inspire them

442
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,120
to play better

443
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,930
I wasn't inspired so have you to do

444
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:16,459
because even if I felt like I wasn't

445
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,460
internalizing it I was

446
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,000
because I felt like no matter how many

447
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:28,840
mistakes someone makes they can be an

448
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,030
actual contributing player to the match

449
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,720
because every time I saw someone do one

450
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,789
dumb mistake I knew we could do better

451
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,770
they could be better and somebody

452
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:43,669
develops high expectations of my

453
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,470
teammate because I knew that that wasn't

454
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:49,850
the best way they could ever make in

455
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,159
their life they could do better and so I

456
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,570
decided to test out this high

457
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,620
expectations mindset in my next game we

458
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,600
were having a great game in this game I

459
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:06,439
mean it was once the ending of a

460
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,260
Cinderella story we all had our match

461
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,159
meaning we all that rules everything was

462
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,429
moving seamlessly through the game

463
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,110
nothing could go wrong right

464
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:20,390
we had the most strongest player in our

465
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:28,570
batch he just kept getting kill after

466
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:32,049
kill after kill and he developed my ego

467
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,830
but I thought I'm chasing after another

468
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:36,799
enemy player

469
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,870
this one is fine it's good whatever I

470
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,500
didn't care he got him cold that's

471
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,299
wherever he turns around and another

472
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,919
player comes behind our probably for

473
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:50,990
revenge killing he gets them too but his

474
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,240
health was a little declining he was

475
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:57,140
damaged a lot but I thought he'll be

476
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:00,950
fine but then I see him heading towards

477
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:04,700
two other enemy players so instead of a

478
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,159
fight being one-on-one it was two-on-one

479
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,169
and so since I'm the supportive player

480
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,000
and I love supporting my teammates I

481
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,680
start heading down there thinking hey

482
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,890
you might

483
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,220
help and before I get there he gets them

484
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:24,400
double kill

485
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:28,660
okay that's four people out we're good

486
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,370
in his house was really low this time

487
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,310
and I'm like he's going to back

488
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,020
obviously he's going to recall he's

489
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,669
gonna retreat because he doesn't have

490
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,160
enough help he doesn't have enough

491
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:43,420
strength to go to a next player in

492
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,300
killer so I back off and or a set of a

493
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,460
part of my I see something again he goes

494
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,980
after another player and it was getting

495
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,510
really close I did not think he was

496
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,840
gonna win this only no this is not

497
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:59,230
happening this is stupid

498
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,949
and he gets up BAM Penta kill five

499
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,210
players down and like a really nice

500
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:10,990
supportive player I decide to support I

501
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:14,800
said hey wow that was amazing

502
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,330
you're so bad and what that means in

503
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,899
league is that you've gotten a lot of

504
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,310
kills you are strong oh it's a pump up

505
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:26,700
his ego you know I needed to win this

506
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:31,570
game I need to eat but he didn't do that

507
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,970
he heard your beating and what feeding

508
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,040
means a league is that you have been

509
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:41,440
dying a lot you've been giving another

510
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:47,710
player kills your week and so for ten

511
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:53,830
minutes I rented this whole things that

512
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:56,220
I bet did you even look at my kills over

513
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,220
No

514
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,190
he was telling teammates the enemy team

515
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,010
this time being in chat to the enemy

516
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:10,070
team giving the enemy team fuel to the

517
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:12,620
fire one thing I've never understood is

518
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,629
giving an enemy team an advantage over

519
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,090
your own team because you're upset with

520
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,070
your own team why would we do that

521
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:27,020
because we're frustrated and we want

522
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:31,309
Iran every time you talk to an enemy

523
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:33,889
player about your annoying team you

524
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:37,940
bring the morale of the team down and of

525
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:40,210
yourself and you increase the chances of

526
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,559
losing the game

527
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:50,660
my teammates knew this and so we decided

528
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:53,240
to band together and forget them because

529
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,520
we didn't need that fifth player who

530
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:02,510
decide to not be a contributor because

531
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:05,840
he misheard me I lied I didn't leave him

532
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:08,179
alive I leave him behind because I have

533
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,540
a really hard time leaving my teammates

534
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:15,070
behind the supporter player so I decided

535
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:17,270
to put in something that I usually do

536
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,620
when I know the match is getting a

537
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:29,540
little sour but I need a rectify it I go

538
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:32,360
into operation team I say hey my mistake

539
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,460
sorry didn't mean that we really need

540
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,990
you in the match you're really strong

541
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,970
and I thought I could win without you

542
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,160
but we really can't so if we can just

543
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:44,210
finish this game with your strengths

544
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,600
weak ego inflated then we could get over

545
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,600
to us

546
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,230
second look okay whatever let's get this

547
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,790
over with

548
00:30:52,230 --> 00:31:00,830
but I know he was feeling real good

549
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:03,330
about himself and we won we won because

550
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:06,030
operation chains on me doesn't leave

551
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,520
anybody behind because when you leave

552
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,850
someone behind no matter how annoying

553
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,040
they are you leave a teammate behind and

554
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:20,939
you increase the chances of the enemy

555
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:23,040
team winning every time we're toxic to

556
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,620
our own teammates inside the security we

557
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,490
bring the morale of security when we

558
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:32,399
bring the morale of the end users down

559
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:36,840
and we give that enemy team up one point

560
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:41,270
in us zero because guess who capitalizes

561
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,270
on someone not caring about security I

562
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:48,350
told you this story to say that

563
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:58,220
sometimes it doesn't begin right

564
00:31:48,350 --> 00:32:04,809
sometimes it can go wrong but

565
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:07,519
we can rectify in our security industry

566
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:10,970
every time you're toxic to an end-user

567
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,809
or speak about them as if they're dumb

568
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:19,159
even with their hearing you we bring the

569
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:22,610
morale down because remember my question

570
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,029
in the beginning you're not going to

571
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,779
finish that

572
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:28,850
we're going to go back to 70 and we

573
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:32,950
increase the chances of being stuck in

574
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,949
the same place we're complaining about I

575
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:42,289
want the end users to know that I am on

576
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,169
their side just like I'm on the side of

577
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:47,299
my teammates when they do something dumb

578
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:48,919
nokay I'm not perfect I'm not always on

579
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,740
their side and sometimes I want to

580
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:56,299
forfeit the match but at the end of the

581
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:00,620
game at the end of the day the bowl is

582
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:02,870
what matters because our expectations of

583
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,039
ourselves as security professionals and

584
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:15,219
others outside of the field is off way

585
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:22,220
off we expect no one to make a mistake

586
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:26,559
while securing for them I want us to

587
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,559
raise our expectations of the end-user

588
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:36,049
so now remember my question in the

589
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:40,159
beginning do you think that the thoughts

590
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:43,309
that you have inside of your head could

591
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,730
influence how someone moves through

592
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,678
space had I thought that player was

593
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,649
stupid and capable when I'm not wasting

594
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:55,159
my time guess what I would have lost

595
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:57,029
more matches than I do now because every

596
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,769
player has some high

597
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:01,320
even if they're a low potential player

598
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,179
they can do something exponential even

599
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,939
if there are bronze level layer and

600
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,250
we're in a plat or diamond to match they

601
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,200
can do something maybe not as good as

602
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,599
someone else but they can help us win

603
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:16,428
they can stand here they can stand here

604
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,429
they cannot do this they cannot do that

605
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:25,799
we have all had someone like I said in

606
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:30,449
the beginning who has made us feel like

607
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:32,940
we were inadequate when we think someone

608
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:37,020
is stupid and users we treat them as

609
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,029
such we don't give them the resources

610
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:46,079
and the guidance that they need because

611
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:51,389
they're stupid what can you learn some

612
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:54,779
professions some roles require us to be

613
00:34:51,389 --> 00:35:00,000
more cognizant of these micro realities

614
00:34:54,779 --> 00:35:02,940
than others when you're a teacher it

615
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,670
matters because it affects how people

616
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,460
grow up thinking about math and science

617
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:12,630
and literature so many people hate it I

618
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,400
know I did it affects how people think

619
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,029
that their IQ when they think it defines

620
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,470
them for their whole entire life but

621
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:25,130
they think they're stupid and it can

622
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:28,049
overcome that it affects our doctors

623
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,720
because it affects how they treat their

624
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:36,569
patients the treatment that they get how

625
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:41,129
they get it and when they get it affects

626
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:47,960
us as security professionals because it

627
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:47,960
affects our strongest defense humans

628
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:59,369
think about our responsibility to

629
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,470
protect information and help others

630
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:05,760
protect theirs it's our responsibility

631
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,959
and we're gonna get annoying because I'm

632
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,030
sure the teachers don't like your kids

633
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,650
but they gotta do it anyways because

634
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,210
they got a passion for it because we all

635
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,030
have a passion for that's why we're here

636
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,820
spending our Friday in here because we

637
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,770
have a passion about it and you don't

638
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,109
have to want to work and users like I do

639
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:30,390
but at least give them the time of day

640
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:32,940
to be human to be you to be imperfectly

641
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:45,240
perfect and still intelligent and

642
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:48,060
capable our micro negatives our dumb and

643
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,339
stupid translates how they write

644
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,990
articles about them and one of our

645
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,520
articles about them everyone who comes

646
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,799
into the field has the same way about

647
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,890
them feels the same way about end users

648
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,090
even if they haven't dealt with them

649
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,220
someone comes across the article if I

650
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,100
came across an article that doctor wrote

651
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,799
about some dumb patients that don't take

652
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,299
the advice about unique one Apple a day

653
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,440
I'd be annoyed because I'm allergic to

654
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:19,109
apples because they don't understand my

655
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:22,440
situation when we speak to them like

656
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:27,140
this when we write about them like this

657
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:31,609
all we see is a self-fulfilling prophecy

658
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,609
garbage in garbage out

659
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,780
sure I'm saying I'm not saying that we

660
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,720
don't have a problem I'm saying we have

661
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,920
a problem but we aren't going about it

662
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,200
the correct way

663
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
we've tried through years in this way

664
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,089
and I believe it's time to shift our

665
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,250
perspective on it instead of the end

666
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,500
users are someone outside of security

667
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,800
being the enemy team I want them to be

668
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:00,760
our team our team that's human our teams

669
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,000
that makes the mistake because I'm sure

670
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,849
someone and some important profession or

671
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,010
role thinks that we're stupid because

672
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:13,390
maybe you haven't had salad today or

673
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,420
you've been eating too many french fries

674
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:18,098
or you haven't driven the car frankly

675
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:25,530
I'm gonna change the oil and you should

676
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:25,530
have but it's not stupidity they see

677
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:35,980
it's not stupidity I see it's just a

678
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:41,349
blind spot let the blind spots are

679
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:44,230
driving our car we have to check what is

680
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:49,480
when you're learning how to drive no one

681
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:52,000
told you about those damn and they were

682
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,300
just everywhere was like oh my god it's

683
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,480
happening on the wires in car accidents

684
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:02,530
what if we told people about the blind

685
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,420
spots but they didn't listen but then we

686
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:08,170
treated them like they're inadequate and

687
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,630
dumb and stupid because they didn't do

688
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:14,970
you ever listen to everything

689
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:18,180
then someone tells you to do our job

690
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,660
like other professionals job it to make

691
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:25,339
people aware of those blind spots our

692
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:28,379
job is not to dehumanize but to guide

693
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,640
because when we do humanize we rob

694
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:39,210
ourselves of our own goals safer streets

695
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:42,440
safer wood whoever said yes to the other

696
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,440
question you're correct

697
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,740
because our inner thoughts can influence

698
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:53,250
how someone moves through space I'm

699
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:57,509
going to read some folks from research

700
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:59,850
studies about this teacher expectations

701
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,200
produce self-fulfilling prophecies and

702
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:06,000
students performance high teacher

703
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,660
expectations results in students high

704
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,570
academic performance and low teacher

705
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:17,370
expectation result in students lower

706
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:19,680
academic performance another second the

707
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:22,650
finding that people are just up and down

708
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,370
to expectations is important because

709
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,620
through their behavior bosses

710
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:32,040
communicate expectations as well as

711
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,670
influencing the self expectations of

712
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,670
ordnance

713
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,020
this was a point this is what I brought

714
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,170
gaming in because it taught me so much

715
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:52,470
and I believe it can taught teach us a

716
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:56,310
lot because you can use a little fun

717
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:59,520
analogy and take it into something

718
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:06,240
that's a little more serious we have a

719
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:14,609
problem I will leave you with a question

720
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:19,950
today what could you do to positively

721
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:22,430
impact how someone feels about

722
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,430
cybersecurity

723
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:40,880
