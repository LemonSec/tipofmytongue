1
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:26,189
they have any Google Docs use a voice

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:28,560
assistant regularly at all no okay so

3
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,240
usually what people think about voices

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,689
systems they think about a special

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:51,120
purpose

6
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:53,940
voice assistant device so anyway so the

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,390
voice assistant devices so what's there

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,608
to study and the voice assistant devices

9
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,760
the bad news is these devices are really

10
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:07,500
simplistic they're just a microphone

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:12,450
some processing and then a speaker

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,210
that's it and besides that the physical

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,790
device itself is pretty solved there was

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,649
a there's a vulnerability in the first

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,160
version

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,350
the Amazon deco that allows somebody to

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,670
JTAG off of it and then you could get

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,949
root access jailbreaking the last two

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,560
versions haven't really had that ability

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,330
in there but from the first one we were

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,280
able to tell that what they're running

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,200
under the hood is an Android operating

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,440
system and Alexa's run awfully good case

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,600
which is fairly interesting but in

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,670
general though these devices are pretty

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,070
solid I mean they're the best case of

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:57,140
Internet of Things these are actually

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,720
the best case devices they're fully

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,420
managed by the companies that would

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,320
imagine they are updated regularly the

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:11,380
firmwares hardened hard to get into

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,690
these devices do pretty much anything so

33
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,790
if we're chance early if we're not

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,920
talking about the device because the

35
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,929
device is pretty solid and what are we

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,980
talking about oh the other thing is that

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,140
it's in to end encrypted the there is

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,869
several pcaps of data streams and you

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,299
can take your own but they're all Indian

40
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,260
and group that I haven't seen any

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:38,690
unencrypted streams from the devices so

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,390
if they're if the device itself is

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,250
pretty solid then where do we go from

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,579
there when it comes to researching these

45
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,100
things one thing I want to point out is

46
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,520
that voice assistance by their nature

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,890
are disembodied that means that the

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,230
first thing you should think about

49
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,070
voice assistant is not the physical

50
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:04,420
packaging like an Amazon's Electrolux of

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:07,810
dr. leg-oh or anything

52
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,880
those are really just ways to tap into

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,870
what's the wheel interface which is the

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,180
voice so think about like on your phone

55
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,690
which any and they show up like

56
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,090
everywhere so one of the major places to

57
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,430
use it if not a physical device as long

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,959
as fun but then they started showing up

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,540
in cars from TVs even the fire sticks

60
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,020
the Amazon fire start si or the remote

61
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,290
for that has a trigger and they're just

62
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,600
like all over the place a lot of public

63
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,290
places are starting to have a voice

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,260
assistant feature they are in a place to

65
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,840
kind of serve you and help you

66
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,160
orientations whatever else they're also

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,170
part of like chatot systems which means

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,290
several clever developers have decided

69
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,010
to take like a slack bot even further

70
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,620
and add a voice Menaul to it tell it to

71
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,470
do that so the point is these

72
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:15,290
since our getting into and synthesize

73
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:16,548
everyone so thank you so then that's

74
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,978
where I want to focus is only

75
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,289
virtualized and instances because

76
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:26,330
there's a commonality across all the

77
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:29,630
platforms fun side note here is that

78
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,219
Siri used to be called half before they

79
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:36,050
renamed it apparently because they

80
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:39,470
figured that name outside about another

81
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,800
interesting note for Siri is that the

82
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,150
company that put it together nuance they

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,580
envisioned Siri has an entire operates

84
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,669
so they had a way to program it on the

85
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,840
fly using some tactical language just

86
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:59,650
talking to it programming it you know

87
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,419
there's all kinds of really cool stuff

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,830
and then Apple bought it and they have

89
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:11,180
this point really they cram it into the

90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:15,169
phone and then basically until recently

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,940
oh I guess a little bit more about the

92
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:21,200
voice of systems here that I meant to

93
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,560
point out we've had a desire in the

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,659
computing space

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,669
action - The Voice assistance into

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,639
pretty much everything and if you think

97
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:33,490
about it a lot of our own a lot of our

98
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,889
sci-fi has a voice assistant component

99
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:41,050
to it in earlier versions of this talk I

100
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:43,590
had like kid kid Fox and Knight Rider he

101
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,060
interacted with Knight Rider via voice

102
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,479
even on Star Trek how do they interact

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,720
with data the voice computer do this

104
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,490
thing like all the things were voice the

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,780
creator of Tetris whose name I can't

106
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:02,050
really pronounce one of his jobs in

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:06,369
education B before he came this was

108
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,800
trying to create a voice assistant or a

109
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,889
voice command interface from the main

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,690
fighters I don't know if they were ever

111
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:17,350
successful but that kind of gives you an

112
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,990
idea of how old the desire to interact

113
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,320
with your computer via voice tips it's

114
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,250
something that's just his natural juice

115
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,190
the problem though is well another

116
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,560
random bit of trivial happened

117
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:36,250
AT&T wanted to be able to detect like

118
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,760
speaking out numbers so for various

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,760
reasons

120
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:49,370
the problem is getting the model voice

121
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
requires a lot of crunching the data so

122
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,100
just like the rest of the machine

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,070
learning a world it kind of lagged for a

124
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,990
long time until we have the processing

125
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,980
there like a bunch of other bits in

126
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,340
place so that brings me to a Platonic

127
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,770
ideal as in like the ideal form of what

128
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,869
a voice assistant is you can pretty much

129
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,299
sum it up into this structure there's

130
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,090
three different machine learning systems

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,580
that are involved in a voice assistant

132
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:26,840
and I know that there's you might be

133
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:29,719
learning that's really what this entire

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,880
platform is so the first part is the

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,070
voice to text just understanding the

136
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,320
human speaking parts you know and then

137
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,469
bringing that to text and then there's

138
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,630
the natural language processing what the

139
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:50,110
person said and all that and then

140
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,110
there's the the device or the assistant

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:58,060
each one of these systems has its own

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,710
and each one of them is an area of

143
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:09,460
research all by itself

144
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:11,409
and it's truly fascinating so I'm just

145
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,150
going to look at the first two if you

146
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:17,380
want to catch me later talk about the

147
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,239
other ones feel free so the first thing

148
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:26,409
is we need to pick apart the acoustic

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:28,930
landscape there's actually a hole in the

150
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,680
in the acoustic space that we can hear

151
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:36,520
and our brains are wired such that we we

152
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,459
like flawlessly or not always flawlessly

153
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,439
but we automatically filter out things

154
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,250
that we know are less important or

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,500
whatever else programmatically we have

156
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,080
to like train to do that and that's

157
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,920
where digital signal processing and all

158
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,100
that so I have the ranges here for for

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,550
like what we can produce as far as voice

160
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,060
and then what we hear and notice that we

161
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,030
can we can hear a lot a lot of wider or

162
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,520
range

163
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,170
and produce with our voice another

164
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,199
random bit of trivia here

165
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:17,319
male voice usually goes 200 Hertz like

166
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,320
in the deep baritone James Earl Jones

167
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:34,339
whitepapers cellphones and basically

168
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,670
just phone carrier operator especially

169
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:52,360
cell phones are very very interested in

170
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:56,510
how much right yes

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,870
that's all there's some other things to

172
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,689
the the less frequency range you you

173
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,730
could care about the less processing you

174
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,490
have to do there's all kinds of benefits

175
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,560
there one thing that's tempting when you

176
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,230
start in the space is to start throwing

177
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,329
out frequency ranges that the voice

178
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,380
could never give to but the problem

179
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:21,230
there is we there's there's information

180
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,200
at the higher ranges outside of what the

181
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:30,050
voice can produce that's still like so a

182
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,360
sound wave affects other ranges above

183
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,859
and so we can detect that and that

184
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:40,610
actually comes into process for example

185
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,490
it's tempting to cut out between three

186
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,710
and six quarters but the problem with

187
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,840
that is

188
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,840
our ability to understand consonants

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,490
another big thing to point out here is

190
00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:01,690
that pulling apart sound is inherently a

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:06,370
lossy process so the more we pull sound

192
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:10,690
apart and that has a security component

193
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:14,310
that we get to intersect so back to the

194
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,900
rainy filling the sounds that you don't

195
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,670
that aren't actually there but your

196
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,780
brain knows that they should be there

197
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,550
this is a trick that was used to get

198
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,670
around the problem of Alexis being

199
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,709
triggered by commercials so this is the

200
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,240
Alexa dog burger commercial which was

201
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,610
one of the first ones that didn't

202
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,320
trigger Alexis and what they did was

203
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,920
they just cut out this frequency range

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,340
here that the human voice would fill

205
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,459
that in but from a digital processing

206
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:51,100
standpoint all that's missing so the

207
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:54,310
model doesn't record so how did it pull

208
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:58,120
apart voice is we run it through what's

209
00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:02,709
called a fast Fourier transformation

210
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,990
saying that wrong pronounced it very

211
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,809
many times but what's what we're

212
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:11,079
effectively doing is we're taking the

213
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:15,969
time domain and we're taking a complex

214
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,769
signal like this make sure that we're

215
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,029
taking a complex signal like this and

216
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,059
we're deep in posing it into the

217
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,160
component parts and that's useful

218
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:28,209
because like I said the acoustic space

219
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,550
has a lot going on and if you a good

220
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,569
thought experiment is to sit and listen

221
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:36,790
and think about how many different

222
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:39,180
sounds different types of sounds that

223
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,349
you can hear going on at the same time

224
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,498
that's the problem that a voice

225
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,540
assistant has to work with and one of

226
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:50,290
the worst most hostile environments when

227
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,389
there's - one of the most hostile

228
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,279
environments is in an airport where

229
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,559
you've got announcers in the background

230
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,769
go people around you you've got like

231
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:04,439
different ranges of people all around

232
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:06,830
it's pretty harsh one of the things that

233
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:09,020
Bose

234
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:13,340
I know others do this too but they're

235
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,920
trying to Bose headphones have they're

236
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,780
trying to latch onto your voice when

237
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,780
you're speaking so that it just picks

238
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,910
that up but the problem is when you stop

239
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,510
speaking that starts arranging and

240
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,360
finding another place so basically one

241
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,100
of my colleagues and we were when he was

242
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,590
talking with his spine when he stopped

243
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,230
talking they ranged and latched on to

244
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,270
they are the airport announcers and that

245
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,170
was as if it was like a handle one of

246
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:44,380
the other there's other examples the

247
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,740
other hospital space would be in a car

248
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:50,930
we one of our first installations of

249
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,620
Alexa was to put it in our car because I

250
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,000
hate like screwing the sound system or

251
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,350
whatever in a car I'd rather just be

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,730
able to tell them play this music so the

253
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,910
the problem there is that you've got

254
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,820
like engine sounds it's in the bag like

255
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,880
all kinds of other things going on now

256
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:16,820
the amazing thing is the Alexa actually

257
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,450
picked up on our voices really well so

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:24,560
the first part of a voiceless system is

259
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:26,889
detecting sound events and by events we

260
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,738
decompose that down to something that's

261
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:33,069
Pulis glass breaking smoke alarms you

262
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:35,759
know to even gunshots lots of cities

263
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:39,069
have gunshot detectors in that detector

264
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,480
it's a sound system that picks up on the

265
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:43,149
sound of the gunshot and then what they

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,290
can also do is triangulate that sound in

267
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:49,269
the city because they have several

268
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:51,160
different detectors and stuff like that

269
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,369
but one thing that I thought was

270
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,618
interesting is one of my first

271
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:59,589
applications for voice assistant was to

272
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:01,720
do this sort of like guard duty thing so

273
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,730
Alexa guard it's not really widely

274
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,790
publicized because there are still some

275
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,279
false positives on it but just the idea

276
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:13,629
that it could detect glass break that's

277
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,730
a sound event and one other interesting

278
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:18,669
note on that is it doesn't work on all

279
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,910
Alexa devices because like I was saying

280
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,589
earlier the Alexa dot is very aware to

281
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,749
make sure all of this really is a

282
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:29,529
microphone very for that amount of

283
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:32,230
processing and that's to to detect more

284
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,759
than just a handful of sound events

285
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,759
takes process

286
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:42,880
so here's what sound events look like if

287
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,329
you were to plot it out using what's

288
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,149
called a male spectrum spectrogram there

289
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:53,638
is that generally sound events don't

290
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:58,149
happen in like like one frame of sound

291
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,860
sound comes in in basically like if

292
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,959
you're taking a sample rate of 16

293
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,160
thousand the second samples a second

294
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,839
then 16,000 samples data frames and what

295
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,339
you're doing with a metal spectra

296
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:16,389
hammers you're taking that raw data and

297
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:19,860
then you're chunking it up so if you're

298
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:22,089
looking at a waterfall top waterfall

299
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:27,130
representation of sound you're looking

300
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:29,079
at a spectrogram of some sort so this is

301
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,839
the visualization of it you can kind of

302
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,899
see like but if you look at it and think

303
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,850
about it you can kind of see that makes

304
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,870
sense like a hydraulic camera you can

305
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,270
see the rhythmic

306
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,610
there and especially how long hits it

307
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,220
floods all the sound of all the

308
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,640
frequencies you can also see like wind

309
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,400
noise the low dull Rumble there milling

310
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,230
machine is a little bit higher than

311
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:59,380
engine sound all that talking is an

312
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,450
interesting one there because it's not a

313
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,310
uniform and that's something that's

314
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:08,590
that's really important when it comes to

315
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:13,310
a voice assistant voice is all about the

316
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:16,189
phone how is perhaps is wrong the phone

317
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:20,240
domains clothings yes they need both

318
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:25,360
phonemes votes yes so the parts of

319
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,359
speech that are intelligent is the

320
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,200
phonics like Sonic like Sonic reading

321
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,780
that's basically what this is it's

322
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,250
decided it's detecting those parts of

323
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:43,280
speech it's not single letters so our

324
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,480
voices of speech doesn't go from voice

325
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,660
straight to like you know it goes to

326
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,930
these phonemes and one interesting thing

327
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,550
about phonemes as they change over time

328
00:17:52,930 --> 00:18:00,260
there's actually an entire field of

329
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:04,190
looking into speech patterns so who to

330
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,780
your head Google Voice before it was

331
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,290
Google Voice when it's Grand Central

332
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,870
Station

333
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:14,720
may I remember that so way back in 2000

334
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:18,229
2002 or so there was Grand Central

335
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:23,330
Station is one of the first voice voice

336
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:27,650
voice calling systems and so you can add

337
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,090
that as to your to yourself plan or

338
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,960
whatever when you don't have it be

339
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,120
yourself playing just tell yourself

340
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
I know store my voicemails with this

341
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,379
company and eventually that grew into

342
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,410
Google Voice and then so the whole point

343
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,660
was they were collecting samples of

344
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:49,620
people speaking throughout the country

345
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,600
and the music thing as I had a deeply

346
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:58,169
southern friend of mine that it always

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:00,389
got wrong always so who uses a like does

348
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:04,920
anybody use Google Voice or any of that

349
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:08,360
today how have you found it to be when

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,190
it comes to transcribing tastin speech

351
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:16,290
better than Microsoft better than

352
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:20,570
Microsoft so the point there is it takes

353
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:25,440
it takes a lot of samples to understand

354
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:29,899
different patterns of speech either the

355
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,900
first dragon to actually speak

356
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,049
[Music]

357
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:41,860
it's so remember how long you had to

358
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:45,130
read two stories

359
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,620
yeah for like 30 minutes or an hour so

360
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:51,100
because it was building a model of your

361
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,658
phonemes of you and so someone else came

362
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,549
along like a friend of mine had one of

363
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,380
those systems and he said here I have

364
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:59,289
said like talk to them it didn't

365
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,210
understand you at all now the other

366
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,429
interesting thing here is that the oral

367
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,149
pronunciation of word was changes over

368
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:13,419
time to one of the papers that amazon

369
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:18,309
has is it detect when you're sick detect

370
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:20,620
that you're sick yes your breathing how

371
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:24,039
do you breathe your breathing affects

372
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,989
how you pronounce these words there's

373
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,669
all kinds of other acoustic things that

374
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,500
are really interesting that I've kind of

375
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,500
gloss over but I will just put in there

376
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,059
then your body makes all kinds of noises

377
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,710
your gut your heart your lungs like all

378
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,408
that makes noises and all of that

379
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,510
actually feeds into acoustical models

380
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:47,220
that we can come up with to detect all

381
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,220
kinds of interesting things about you so

382
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,570
so not only can it detect your like

383
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:16,909
whether you're sick especially the

384
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:19,200
respiratory illness it also so the

385
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,080
variance of your voice over time

386
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,980
actually place and has it a very big

387
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,260
security component to it is if I

388
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,900
remember this story

389
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,300
Alexa sent 17 or Amazon some employee

390
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,610
Amazon since 1700 lecture recordings to

391
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,610
the wrong person a lot of people saw

392
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:48,060
what was we we can deduce out of that

393
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,919
that Amazon is continually reading

394
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,919
models based on the data

395
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:08,020
you really think about other stuff too

396
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:15,370
but when several weeks we could deduce

397
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:19,560
from this one it's roughly portly a

398
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:23,139
person's recordings from their Alexa -

399
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:26,560
more than likely their story means into

400
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,770
one big way and that's probably what led

401
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,750
to this incident - is that the employer

402
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,830
was like well the data is in in this

403
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,420
batch here and so it collected like a

404
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:43,300
whole bunch of other people's recordings

405
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:46,030
- now what the motherboard is wrong here

406
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,639
the Alexa is not continually recording

407
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,570
and uploading that would take enormous

408
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,430
amount of and the Alexis and all other

409
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:59,290
devices cheat by listening for a keyword

410
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:02,410
that's really the only process and

411
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,780
that's done on an Alexa device it's

412
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,020
continually sampling the other space and

413
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:12,879
looking for a collection of phonemes

414
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,730
that match to the keyword that's really

415
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,610
[Music]

416
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:20,100
is that a PK that's listening to the

417
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,219
sound and then trying to match it that's

418
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,260
also life we go back the Alexa garb can

419
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,440
only run on certain devices because you

420
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,650
have to add these other sound apps but

421
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,570
actually add those to the device

422
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,530
besides that yes once you trigger the

423
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,639
device it starts recording and it starts

424
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,210
basically pulling apart the audio

425
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,690
strings and then trying to that piece

426
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,070
what it pulls apart up to the 12 it's

427
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:52,890
not pulling it's not sending rotated

428
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,409
remember back to here almost doing is

429
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,000
it's trying to identify the speaker and

430
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:01,070
there's actually a branded paper that

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,070
just came out recently where Alexis of

432
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,930
triggers it then it will only it tries

433
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:11,280
to anchor itself to your voice if you've

434
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,700
ever played with the license our

435
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,500
families played a lot of Alexis one

436
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,240
person will trigger it and they want to

437
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,490
change the song where they have thought

438
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,170
it through their mind all the way and so

439
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,620
another kid slipped right in there with

440
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,620
their song

441
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,320
that's the sort of thing that that

442
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,580
elects the developers are trying to

443
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,200
they're not trying to fix that problem

444
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,110
in particular but they're trying to make

445
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:43,990
it more responsive to the person that's

446
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:43,990
true another issue there is that Alexis

447
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,369
right so they set this back to the wrong

448
00:24:52,929 --> 00:25:01,210
person one way to to kind of guard

449
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:04,649
against this is to flood out with sound

450
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:08,200
checks this actually helps your devices

451
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:14,468
operate better overall I had a headset

452
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:23,739
recently was on a conference call and we

453
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:25,659
have a an AC unit but after going

454
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:27,759
through like this material my life

455
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:30,309
several times she was like that I bet

456
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,529
it's gonna operate a lot better because

457
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,769
it's flooding out the background noise

458
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:38,229
and it basically blocks this other noise

459
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:42,339
from you how many of you have ever

460
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:44,349
studied noise cancellation it's

461
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:48,190
effectively with noise cancellation is

462
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:51,158
it's flooding the sound to kind of if

463
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,249
it's trying to create a acoustical

464
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,379
brigid operator so the point here for

465
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:59,950
water falls and I want to throw this out

466
00:25:56,379 --> 00:26:02,168
as part of the audio security is we have

467
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,919
the concept of firewalls when it comes

468
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,919
to network

469
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:10,189
I would argue the the equivalent putting

470
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,389
a conservatory for all your security

471
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,270
would be wonderful so and yes this is a

472
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:21,209
reference to TLC these images

473
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:23,400
yes to go chasing waterfalls noise yes

474
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,020
it helps isolate sound and one

475
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,120
interesting thing that I found one

476
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,840
started moving into the whole audio

477
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,309
space

478
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:37,678
silence abilities basically the same

479
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:46,440
it's just the intensity of the pitch is

480
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:48,840
different but when your device if you if

481
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,910
you were to like lower the game over for

482
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,540
a cruise today they're getting static

483
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:58,130
either way so sad our silence is a very

484
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,129
subjective concept

485
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,920
Microsoft has a soundproof room that's

486
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:14,020
one of the most critically dead rooms

487
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,020
ever looks like negative

488
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:26,660
anyway so what if we were to take the

489
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,870
concept and water call and apply it to

490
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:36,710
an election we basically have an Alexa

491
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:39,229
parasite so this is a this is called

492
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,270
Project alias you can find the have

493
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,370
exported actually have a collection of

494
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:49,490
exact words

495
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:54,530
it's and inside of this hat we have

496
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:56,540
raspberry pi a and two speakers these

497
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,460
speakers are just continually flooded

498
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,860
the device under it and what the

499
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,710
Raspberry Pi is doing is it's acting as

500
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:07,100
a buffer and what it's doing is I can

501
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:10,130
program it to listen to a difference of

502
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,169
acoustical triggers for events and then

503
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,510
it will stop flooding the device

504
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,390
underneath it play the weight key work

505
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,940
and then go ahead and do whatever I want

506
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:23,030
to do most people though aren't going to

507
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:28,610
pay an additional like fifty or so

508
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:33,149
dollars after parts and labor soldering

509
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:36,330
you know to do this but it'll at least I

510
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:39,209
present it here to give you an idea this

511
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,649
is how we can go about securing or what

512
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:48,110
way we can go about securing these

513
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:50,969
devices so along the feed the whole

514
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,709
telling in the acoustical space trying

515
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,710
to figure out who's speaking to the

516
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,210
device we can easily tell just

517
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,419
mathematically I showed earlier the

518
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,100
pitch range between the male and female

519
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:04,559
there's also a pitch range from children

520
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:11,178
to so we could just tell based on pitch

521
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:16,529
this is probably that's pretty easy

522
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:19,110
what's more difficult is to is to it

523
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:21,779
before the identity of the person that's

524
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:25,350
speaking to the device now I'm going to

525
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:30,450
make an assertion here that there is not

526
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:33,330
enough data in the human voice range to

527
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,600
give us enough like certainty to guard

528
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:40,590
against collisions what that means in

529
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,730
English is any voice on mocking is

530
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,730
inherently insecure

531
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:58,210
or other baby yeah a trade commodity

532
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,580
your voice like very tightly trend yes

533
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,570
but even then I'm going to go back and

534
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,600
say that that would be smooth but we'll

535
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:10,300
get to that as a faculty practice right

536
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,240
so and this section goes into biometric

537
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:16,030
security in general it all has to do

538
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,510
with the scanning or how much input data

539
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,160
you get and an ugly secret with

540
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,050
biometric security is they're all

541
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,700
inducing the same sort of signal

542
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,730
differentiation and pattern matching

543
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,310
they're all fuzzy they're all the lossy

544
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:33,390
so there's always going to be a much

545
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:36,879
higher statistical chance of a collision

546
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:42,520
then if you were not if you were putting

547
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:45,160
in like a public key so the most the

548
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,830
device could do that an Alexa can do is

549
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,740
determined that there are different

550
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,110
speakers in the room the Alexa can't

551
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,500
even determine whether you are the same

552
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:59,379
you today tomorrow Mike there even in

553
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:05,100
the course of one conversation with us

554
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:05,100
it'll even switch to different

555
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:12,629
there's something changed now you're a

556
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:15,359
different person altogether so to deal

557
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:18,119
with that Alexis have had to and also

558
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,600
because the company's behind these

559
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:23,939
devices want to make them responsive

560
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,459
earlier it used to be that we could talk

561
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,950
to our licks in our car like just

562
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,190
naturally you know we could also trigger

563
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,580
the Alexa across the room I mean really

564
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,590
a good promise but they're also really

565
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:45,899
ways and everything else going back to

566
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:49,080
the Alexa recordings Alexis have got a

567
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:51,629
lot stricter about what they accept as

568
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,039
an input range basically we now have to

569
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:55,039
yell at the Alexa in the car

570
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:03,280
so so I went back to the speaker

571
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,790
identification signal remember they're

572
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,460
going to be Singlish my voice is my

573
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,950
passport that hot that ol see me to play

574
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,870
like collect all these samples the

575
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:22,600
voices of interest for 10 years they

576
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:25,540
already sectioned I need to throw out 4

577
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,379
times but the interesting thing here is

578
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:33,340
it was already demonstrated as being not

579
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:39,640
very accurate and Lawson and then the

580
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:41,199
bank decided and what Smith what makes

581
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,210
this even more terrifying is I'm

582
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,130
researching this I've come to the

583
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,820
conclusion that voice identification is

584
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:56,710
a problem it hasn't been solved visits

585
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:59,250
the voice and I see my bank okay there's

586
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,250
still my bag

587
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:10,580
now they have is my voice I think

588
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:17,980
security of course it's secure like you

589
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:21,169
know they worked other bets for suit

590
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,300
HSBC and just in case you thought my

591
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:26,180
bank was unique your may probably

592
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,970
thought this was a great idea to just

593
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,940
say so HSBC had this big thing where

594
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,860
they're like otters can't be you know

595
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,980
broken into whatever social security

596
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,899
researcher over in the UK said show you

597
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:44,330
how easy it is to pull this I've seen

598
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:50,570
the speaker right what's even worse does

599
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:54,169
it online BBC but it's not an identical

600
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:57,320
twin didn t have a Wrangler so they they

601
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,840
know that people really well we've got a

602
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,090
guy in our office that if he sits with

603
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,990
somebody for like a week or so he picks

604
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:08,569
up on what the mannerisms are fine to my

605
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,690
verbal tics all this other stuff anybody

606
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:14,649
has children and how they mock each

607
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,649
other like

608
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:21,179
the point there is it's not that hard

609
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,339
and people can do it to like just you

610
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,909
don't even need like advanced technology

611
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:31,168
just like we do this art nature does

612
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:33,240
this guy's mockingbirds the Lyrebird the

613
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,190
Lyrebird is actually known for mimicking

614
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:40,009
like all kinds of other acoustical

615
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,010
sounds around them because you can't

616
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,669
there's something terribly exactly like

617
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,670
me more than once

618
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,880
yeah that's my point there are only so

619
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,879
good bits and so assuming that a voice

620
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,319
could be used as an as a single factor

621
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,530
now if you want to use it as part of a

622
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:30,880
multi factor maybe but as a single

623
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:35,420
factor it's not about other other

624
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,569
applications of voice unlocking

625
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,599
tomfoolery it has to do with this so I

626
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:45,619
recently switched from iPhone to pixel

627
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,049
and I saw that totally they actually

628
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,359
allow voices unlocking it's one of the

629
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:52,549
few funds that does but at least Google

630
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,710
has the wherewithal the same you can

631
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:57,349
turn this on that you're making your

632
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,609
devices less secure just glad you know

633
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:04,450
that in fact recently within like like

634
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:04,450
in the last month

635
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:25,220
they're about voice unlock even and all

636
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:30,169
that stuff nothing else no to allow that

637
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:32,930
to happen so that is the that's just the

638
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:37,970
first machine learning system getting

639
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:45,740
their voice to text the second one how

640
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:48,319
we doing on time 10:40 that I company

641
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,299
third floor now so the second part is

642
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,960
natural language processing in taxonomy

643
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,450
so here's a basically a breakdown of

644
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,180
what happens when you talk too much when

645
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,939
we first got them

646
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:05,118
just talk to like an old friend you know

647
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,460
just the law all that like no it's a

648
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,099
program and the people who are doing the

649
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:14,210
natural length of the process they don't

650
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:16,819
have like it's not it doesn't go one

651
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:19,790
thread think about what you want to tell

652
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:23,058
it and then tell it in this format Alexa

653
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:27,619
the wait word whatever the action verb

654
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:35,300
is tell play and whatever implication

655
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:38,150
name which is and then the or

656
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,160
various that's it that's the floor

657
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,349
you've never had trouble dealing with

658
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,020
your likes of devices probably because

659
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:47,059
you're not telling it what it needs in

660
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:51,550
the time it needs to it in the format

661
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:55,579
that needs but even with that constraint

662
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:58,790
Alexis still have a pretty good range

663
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:00,680
and also Google to and I'm pretty good

664
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,290
brain to be able to tell what you meant

665
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:09,109
your attention and that's all natural

666
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:11,808
language processing so some of the

667
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:14,480
security implications there is that so

668
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:19,040
companies really tightened to kill the

669
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:22,460
taxonomy of the voice assistance

670
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,740
this taxonomy is classification so the

671
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:28,130
classification of this whole stream here

672
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,450
and then the invocation names so what

673
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,340
they also do is craft a better

674
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:38,180
experience that you have sheets in the

675
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:40,250
taxonomy Alexa play and start playing

676
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,140
the song it in first four it has the

677
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,720
cheetah in there saying holy who said

678
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,319
play so it must be not a sound all this

679
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,839
stuff search engines do the same thing

680
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,550
they know it knows to searching for

681
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,110
different search remember or switch it

682
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,720
to a different circle if you're

683
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:59,630
searching for like car parks it doesn't

684
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,700
just entertain Rahl search for that part

685
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,360
that goes into the college searching

686
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,359
taxonomy

687
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,190
[Music]

688
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,729
because

689
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,460
[Music]

690
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:18,779
this assistant is that we don't own any

691
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,640
of that so part of it it's part of the

692
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:25,019
implication there is that you don't know

693
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,259
what happens talking to this is a huge

694
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:31,198
problem but you have no verification of

695
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,719
the tap that you've just triggered now

696
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,329
what does that do for children we're

697
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:40,170
talking to Alexis and asking me to play

698
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:43,819
the set time scales whatever else or my

699
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,819
smartass kids when they start asking

700
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:03,900
[Laughter]

701
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:07,029
there's no sense of context this is a

702
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,820
it's part of the central research from

703
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:13,240
the voice' system but for now there's no

704
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,940
session think about that we are in the

705
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,640
free web era where there's not even a

706
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,410
web session to do you know what the

707
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
implication of the security implication

708
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,180
there is I would give so this is a great

709
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,810
time for me to point out the book I

710
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,129
would give this the first person that

711
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,840
can tell me what the security

712
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,840
application of having no session

713
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,510
[Applause]

714
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,490
[Music]

715
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,580
and because the session was already open

716
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,990
because that's how the website works

717
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,890
that's also how Google Doc works -

718
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:13,160
there's no verification also they also

719
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:25,770
they didn't into it later like a

720
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:28,140
two-factor type if you have authorized

721
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:31,230
your device to do something you can do

722
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:34,230
that abusive way when I went up to

723
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:37,280
Seattle awhile back there's hotels there

724
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:39,900
that have a Lexus of all of October's

725
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,290
okay that sounds pretty cool right I

726
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,720
mean for somebody who likes you know the

727
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:49,130
promise of the voice the system like to

728
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,129
turn the lights off

729
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:57,900
yeah what are they off the roads to turn

730
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:01,210
off the light of my room

731
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,660
okay that's because of that session

732
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:12,970
problem that is every time you talk to

733
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:16,390
the Alexa every command is by itself now

734
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,759
what that means is that so

735
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,470
anybody remember this case of the Alexa

736
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:26,710
that recorded the family's conversations

737
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:32,200
everybody what happened was going back

738
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:34,770
to the sound events Alexa thought of her

739
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:39,129
dad's name and then it thought a curve

740
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:41,920
call and then it just decided okay and

741
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:44,170
then if I heard a content so those three

742
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,770
pieces right this all natural language

743
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,630
processing

744
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,060
so then what it does after that is that

745
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,190
both an audio channel so I send the

746
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,980
information that puts it over to that

747
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,440
content Alexa did what it was supposed

748
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,690
to do it

749
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,640
parsed it out all that so what was the

750
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:04,390
response does if I know the response to

751
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,650
secure this Matt is on side five you

752
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,549
guys are going to pitch a moment about

753
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:12,040
the Alexa like being so responsible then

754
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,400
we're just going to lock it down this is

755
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,500
actually what

756
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,270
now having the jello by Aleksey of

757
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,610
course every time I tell my legs in the

758
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:22,490
car remember this case somewhere it's

759
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:25,040
because you guys you didn't have the

760
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:32,600
whatever else and now I have to tell my

761
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:37,190
Lex I have to use my yeah and this was

762
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:40,370
like so what I'll leave you guys with is

763
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:42,700
this there's still some really big

764
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:48,950
challenges to solve it comes to voice

765
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:51,859
audience police identity not enough bits

766
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:55,700
of information for you to actually to

767
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:57,320
authorize yourself or much less I did it

768
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,279
for there's not enough bits of

769
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,960
information for you to identify yourself

770
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,360
much less authorizing a particular

771
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,170
person and that kind of fits into the

772
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,910
privilege separation Alexis with the the

773
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:16,840
long-running concession tokens

774
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:16,839
effectively it's just authorized

775
00:45:23,430 --> 00:46:56,759
but basically there's ten minutes

776
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:35,710
my meditation is really close

777
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:40,960
because they need that and the data to

778
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:43,510
know that your mail probably do you live

779
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,220
around Kentucky like they need all that

780
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,190
bits of information to train their

781
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,689
models problems so no they have

782
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:52,390
identifiable information on each one of

783
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,120
the voices in fact there's two open more

784
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,609
cases right now in discovery part of

785
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,310
their discovery is we know that there

786
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,350
was an Alexa present and we know that it

787
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:09,220
was triggered at some point those two

788
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:11,710
pieces there are two pieces to the

789
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,750
Porsche and so far they as far as I know

790
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,850
they've been holding the line that's

791
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,270
we're not going to be we're not gonna be

792
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:24,130
that seeking for you to get this data so

793
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:26,800
the other part the control part based on

794
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,050
recent articles that have come out of as

795
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,920
on employees just trading back and forth

796
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,920
in their slack rooms

797
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:15,290
yes yes

798
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:42,120
- that's not Santa

799
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:48,400
pass that that has that's the reason why

800
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:50,700
so much is because they require now and

801
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,350
other versions of this talk I go into

802
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:57,580
do-it-yourself audio voice assistance I

803
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:06,220
would love since we're the hacker

804
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:14,049
conference especially since voice

805
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:16,810
assistants are to build your own voices

806
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:19,440
system that is completely secure because

807
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:23,200
[Music]

808
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:38,490
it will be closely tied to whatever

809
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:38,490
subject so that's the trade-off

810
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:46,670
doing this I'm able to talk to a kiosk

811
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,330
or something they can understand me

812
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,440
because they had that rich stored data

813
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:55,730
but the house that goes back to the

814
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,450
water calling to pay attention to what

815
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:59,980
you're saying

816
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,980
Oh Raffi's assistance

817
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:48,540
yeah so the reason why that happens is

818
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:51,180
the model going back to separating it's

819
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,130
called the far-field problem the farther

820
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:57,120
away from the device the born always

821
00:51:53,130 --> 00:52:05,550
comes in and so the looser the model has

822
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:08,100
to be this music detection systems

823
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,930
lectures they Emerson find that the way

824
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,150
that those systems have to work is they

825
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:15,000
they sample the space and they have like

826
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:17,250
certain pieces that hit but then they

827
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,360
they have to assume that if there's

828
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:23,970
gonna be cuts out like you're trying to

829
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,520
listen to a song and some guy who's

830
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:30,029
talking over it or something

831
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,560
pull out this is an example so same

832
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,410
thing happens with a far-field

833
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:36,060
activation problem it's if the reason I

834
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,549
have to shout out it is because it's

835
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:41,490
it's looking the tolerances for the

836
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:43,500
dropouts are a lot smaller and that

837
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:47,759
means that it needs a clear direct

838
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:50,720
signal a sports activation like

839
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,720
signature

840
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:56,710
mr. Fogg filled with yelling an Alexa

841
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:59,480
where you will see a lot of improvement

842
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:02,510
is when we start having more what's

843
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,760
called a hero and applause so you have a

844
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:08,090
headset it's really close to the sound

845
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,190
source and so you can like fine-tune

846
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:12,560
like it needs to have this person role

847
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,410
in the concerts but that doesn't change

848
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:21,049
the activation problem in the sense of

849
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:23,450
the word I'm not sure any device and

850
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:29,890
worship device that allows you to set a

851
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,890
free open source to do that

852
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,430
that's the sound protection if they

853
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:49,799
allow people to just name the device

854
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:51,450
planted a lot of that go away then it

855
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,080
would increase the cost of the device

856
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,080
itself

857
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,550
the question was

858
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:10,960
they're surprisingly

859
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,559
[Music]

860
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:43,849
right and like I've got

861
00:56:44,430 --> 00:57:17,649
Holmes is trying to the far field Palmer

862
00:56:49,910 --> 00:57:17,649
I just

863
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:40,640
[Applause]

864
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,869
[Music]

865
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:02,119
what are you doing there man okay
