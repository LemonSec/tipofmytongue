1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,640
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a just a basic</font>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,890
presentation based on my experiences of

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,349
contester and maybe there'll be some

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in here where you you guys might</font>

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,198
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought this some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:24,619
at one point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so will you may</font>

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:29,720
be able to relate so so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if this</font>

8
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:32,820
first slide is shocking to you you may

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,100
have meant to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other the other</font>

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,129
presentation so hopefully in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,200
place but so we're going to talk a

12
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:45,930
little bit about the laws and

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,510
consequences of cyber insecurity and how

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,610
ultimately the ultimate consequence

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,190
could be the likely destruction of

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,190
mankind but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get back to that later</font>

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,798
h-town hello

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:22,920
okay okay cool all right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,679
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with some some of</font>

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,700
these the hack of at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,330
companies in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years and</font>

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,640
obviously these aren't the only

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,350
companies that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard of</font>

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
that it got hacked but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously well known pretty large</font>

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:47,130
companies government entities things of

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:49,350
that nature so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw</font>

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,100
out a couple quotes that were made

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,559
fairly recently one is the Chinese<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,149
penetrated every major corporation of

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,880
any consequence in the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

32
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,500
taken information that was a stated by

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,020
Mike McConnell former director of the

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">NSA and my other quote is there are two</font>

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,560
kinds of big companies in the United

36
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,420
States there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those who've been</font>

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,769
hacked by the Chinese and those who

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they've been hacked by the</font>

39
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:25,640
Chinese and that's why the current

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:25,640
director of the FBI James Comey hello

41
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,590
double click to ya back hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait when</font>

42
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,810
you want oh so the arrows are working

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:45,950
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> now great okay so so what about</font>

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">your company when you see you see hacks</font>

45
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:53,660
on the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these these entities</font>

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:57,620
you know d do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just ignore them you</font>

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,210
not pay attention you know who well just

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,690
consider those as a warning shots for

49
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:07,040
you and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should really be</font>

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:11,320
introspective start taking seriously

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,320
what the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your company is</font>

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay disclaimer all right</font>

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,750
so I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing NVA pt's or network</font>

54
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,860
vulnerability assessment 10 tests for a

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of years social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering is</font>

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,280
part of that where you might make phone

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,950
calls or send phishing emails and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:49,910
occasionally work on incidents now this

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,679
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to who I think I am the</font>

60
00:03:49,910 --> 00:04:03,500
reality hurts though this is actually a

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:06,260
really in reality so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a basic role or for your scientists</font>

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,299
or mathematicians out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and axiom</font>

64
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,240
and that is your company will never be

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,940
secure okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a number of</font>

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons for this and I've listed some</font>

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,738
there and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into each of those</font>

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,880
areas so there's three ways you can

69
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:27,530
address risk you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore it you</font>

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">could address it or mitigate it try and</font>

71
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,409
mitigate it or you can transfer it with

72
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,419
like a cyber insurance that's sort of a

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:40,550
new thing still kind of being worked out

74
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:44,359
so so you want to raise the cost of

75
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:48,320
exploitation so that attackers will move

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,680
on to easier targets so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,680
of a goal

78
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so we tend not to want to try</font>

79
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,169
understand things but really like every

80
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,870
one of us should try and understand

81
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,419
technology a little bit at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least a</font>

82
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,229
cursory understanding you know because

83
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:18,359
it often seems like magic to us it's

84
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not so media tends to fuel fuel</font>

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fears of things and</font>

86
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,049
misunderstandings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> often times you</font>

87
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,029
see in the the news that you know

88
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,759
attacks oh this was a sophisticated

89
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack against us you see that all the</font>

90
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">time over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over again in reality at</font>

91
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,500
least the initial attack is not

92
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,080
sophisticated in most cases you know

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,990
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about phishing email to</font>

94
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,188
you know an employee of a company I mean

95
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,810
that's so so we'd like to implement

96
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:54,449
things without understanding the

97
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:55,830
consequences of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you</font>

98
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,960
know devices that are placed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

99
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,389
internet you know get immediately

100
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,909
attacked you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know very just a few</font>

101
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess there you've</font>

102
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen things out there you know within</font>

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,029
the first seven minutes of putting a

104
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:13,349
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the internet it gets it</font>

105
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:15,839
starts getting attacked most companies

106
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:18,479
don't know that they're there they're

107
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:24,900
being exploited or what we like to cut

108
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:27,300
the term pwned and on average a company

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,388
becomes aware of an exploitation of

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:36,479
their network after<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thirds of a year</font>

111
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:41,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes they're notified by a</font>

112
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,199
third party like the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> or somebody who</font>

113
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">was being attacked because they went</font>

114
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:53,250
through your company to attack them so

115
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,810
you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you know what we</font>

116
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't understand you know there's this</font>

117
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">expectation that were you know we paint</font>

118
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,430
we can quickly fix this yeah week with

119
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:05,870
you we expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> but unfortunately</font>

120
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,870
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> ism isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

121
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,979
so the world is when you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

122
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,900
internet the world's at your doorstep

123
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally at your doorstep in the</font>

124
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:29,380
virtual world the entire internet so you

125
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and and if you take care of the the</font>

126
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,960
you know if you have a cisco router

127
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,430
around on the internet and you keep it

128
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,130
patched and<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date you're you're</font>

129
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,660
you're doing good annual and you know

130
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,820
Cisco does a great job of keeping

131
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:46,479
keeping on top of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things what if</font>

132
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,699
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often see is</font>

133
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:54,520
when a company has custom applications

134
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:57,410
so they develop their custom things so

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,979
when we see that we love that and you

136
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">better watch out because your cus nobody</font>

137
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,300
nobody else cares about your custom

138
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:10,669
applications they don't they don't care

139
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,260
about you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your particular web</font>

140
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:17,810
app that your in-house developers

141
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:20,740
created that that's they could care less

142
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">and unless you're being targeted and</font>

143
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often see these</font>

144
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:28,750
custom applications and because no one's

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,659
really attacked them you know what

146
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:37,429
specifically targeting them they're

147
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:39,020
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerable so just the reality is</font>

148
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,270
that in defense on the offensive side

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,880
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on that side I understand</font>

150
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,829
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scare everything you're</font>

151
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,660
worried about everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> where is on</font>

152
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,150
offense the attacker they only have to

153
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:56,480
find one thing and they can gain<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

154
00:08:50,150 --> 00:09:00,459
foothold so the proper implementation of

155
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,459
the security technologies is a challenge

156
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:11,060
and do it I think the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

157
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,940
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good security features</font>

158
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,650
into products<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes the problem is</font>

159
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're turned on off by default</font>

160
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,579
and they expect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,550
and that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be turned</font>

162
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:28,050
on but they you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes things</font>

163
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get turned on you know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

164
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,359
things turned on security things by

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:36,120
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on is good that's what you</font>

166
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,330
know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should demand more than</font>

167
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:46,740
turn off by default and expected be

168
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:48,600
turned on um so often<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you know the</font>

169
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,010
inside of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network yeah we don't do</font>

170
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,200
as good a job as security but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

171
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we're really hardened to the</font>

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet facing to the external and</font>

173
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,880
that's good but you got to realize

174
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,560
you're really just one click<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

175
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:08,930
the outside to the inside and once again

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:15,150
fishing is a perfect example of that so

177
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:17,819
so we do our assessments we don't we

178
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,640
don't use zero day so we sometimes find

179
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,880
0 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but just by accident</font>

180
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,250
our scanners might find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we don't</font>

181
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,900
specifically attempt to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days</font>

182
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:33,650
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um we still have a</font>

183
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:38,550
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> success rate without you know</font>

184
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:40,020
having zero days or and if somebody

185
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,910
doesn't know what a zero-day is it's

186
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,400
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's an unpublished</font>

187
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:53,719
vulnerability in the product or

188
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:55,740
application whatever so so one statistic

189
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-nine percent of exploited</font>

190
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,590
vulnerabilities were compromised more

191
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">than a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after they were published so</font>

192
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:11,700
obviously patching hygiene isn't up up

193
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:15,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to speed and and we find yeah I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

194
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,300
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> find to this day Microsoft</font>

195
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,980
vulnerabilities we love to exploit you

196
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:25,380
know Oh 80 67 is one of our favorites

197
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,210
conficker came out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that we</font>

198
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,189
love that vulnerability and we still see

199
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:36,260
it even<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this day and that's been</font>

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:38,050
hmm seven eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> years now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

201
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">their own systems that are just kind of</font>

202
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,490
maybe legacy systems they don't use them

203
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,560
anymore whatever but for whatever reason

204
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,530
they still have them turned on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,880
shoved to the side not not thought about

206
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:55,189
but still on the network still

207
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:59,000
accessible so one thing forces

208
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,620
securities at odds with profit so you

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,810
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that product out</font>

210
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,580
you know down the torpedoes full speed

211
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:12,560
ahead I mean it's you know one question

212
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know how are these big companies</font>

213
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:20,000
being hurt by breaches yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in</font>

214
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:23,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some cases they are though I just saw TJ</font>

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,040
maxx I<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're about to open like</font>

216
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,210
a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> new storage or something of</font>

217
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,819
course TJ<font color="#E5E5E5"> maxx was that company that</font>

218
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,950
their parent got popped and yeah

219
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,780
millions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> beans or credit cards all</font>

220
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,520
that target I mean they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

221
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,360
those companies are still around there

222
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,400
still now the smaller companies I mean

223
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,030
some haven't gone out some have gone out

224
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:56,990
of business as a result of of being

225
00:12:50,030 --> 00:13:00,260
exploited so so things can be made

226
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,320
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the question is</font>

227
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:08,930
how workable is it once you've made

228
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,940
things secure enough so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

229
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,359
middle ground that you you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

230
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">go with you still have to have usability</font>

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,480
you know along with security so and you

232
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:24,650
may not realize it but you're part of an

233
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,860
escalating war in the computer security

234
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,860
world

235
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:41,940
oh how many admins do we have out there

236
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:47,970
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> database network anyone i'm</font>

237
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:53,070
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> out goodies anyone admins willing</font>

238
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:56,960
to admit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well you can come</font>

239
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,960
up afterwards and get these security

240
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:06,450
this was kind of a setup so you guys

241
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,060
were right not to not to take those<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

242
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so so IT people were unruly like</font>

243
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,459
I'm one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so we're unruly people</font>

244
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,510
right so so we're lazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's admit</font>

245
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:20,490
it to ourselves we are lazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

246
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">taught we say we're efficient right and</font>

247
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,740
then you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of efficiency</font>

248
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:29,220
but really we're lazy so that's what we

249
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,570
exploit we exploit your laziness so if

250
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,280
you're working as an admin in a company

251
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,730
we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of that in our</font>

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,370
assessment work so you know it's not

253
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,390
totally your fault you're overworked you

254
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,620
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear many hats you know you're</font>

255
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes powerless in the</font>

256
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-making so you know the right</font>

257
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,420
decisions to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just goes up the</font>

258
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,219
chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doesn't go anywhere so now</font>

259
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,800
oftentimes you don't understand security

260
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,950
so in it a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that's not your</font>

261
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,540
fault you know IT schools don't teach it

262
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,220
I mean they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better now the</font>

263
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,709
NSA is putting some money in some of

264
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:15,980
these schools and awareness is going up

265
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:18,540
but it's not taught so we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

266
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,750
when people get rellis ventev where we

267
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,670
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do work for them yeah there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

268
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,910
may be trying to hide something whether

269
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:30,209
it's the you know in competence or

270
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,890
whatever but and you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tourism</font>

271
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,990
plays a role in that I mean everyone

272
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,930
takes ownership of things so it is you

273
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,660
know it's their baby or whatever so

274
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,939
somebody you know slapping their baby

275
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,230
coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that so it's</font>

276
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:49,009
understandable yeah anytime we we see

277
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,980
pride or arrogance from people yeah that

278
00:15:49,009 --> 00:16:00,139
typically it doesn't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> well for them at</font>

279
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:04,850
the end all right unfortunately we have

280
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deal with humans and so they tend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

281
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,490
ignore your corporate policies and

282
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,350
training right training training

283
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,759
training all these policies wonderful

284
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,430
policies we put out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you still</font>

285
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,509
need them you still have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

286
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:21,709
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people will ignore them so</font>

287
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:24,529
they click on lengths and emails so

288
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:27,378
stats out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there show about a fourth of</font>

289
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:31,519

307
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:28,909
is kind of targeted specifically toward

308
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:33,649
a company there's a third or a third or

309
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:35,659
fourth term where um emails are

310
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:39,260
specifically targeted to your sea levels

311
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:43,700
does anybody know what that might be

312
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,120
let's see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who want who likes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">alright this man kept he likes candy and</font>

315
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think he knows the answer so wailing</font>

316
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:05,390
arrived yes congratulations you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

pot of gold yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a term</font>

318
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:13,910
that's really not heard too much in the

319
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,680
media but<font color="#E5E5E5"> wailing so yeah and I think</font>

320
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more ransomware</font>

321
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:25,930
now you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> so these these emails are</font>

322
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:29,150
being sent you know that there's some

323
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,270
you know background discovery done who's

324
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,150
the sea levels at a company and just

325
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,840
very few emails are sent to those sea

326
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:41,660
levels very targeted saying you know

327
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever we need the w2s or whatever it</font>

328
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,080
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> send you know and it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font>

329
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:53,110
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from somebody else in the company</font>

330
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:55,429
so but wailing yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep absolutely yeah</font>

331
00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:00,949
yep that's very common that we've seen

332
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:03,590
that yo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so the humans like to</font>

333
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:09,410
give out credentials over the phone yay

334
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:12,800
ah good for us they choose bad passwords

335
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,260
so when users are given a choice they

336
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,580
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use bad passwords that we can</font>

337
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,500
crack fairly easily and they like to

338
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,939
store unencrypted passwords on the

339
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,100
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure none of your company's</font>

340
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,460
your people ever do that right but we

341
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:31,570
find this all the time and please stop

342
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,190
it because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too easy people</font>

343
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,010
know if you have like an internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

344
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,440
sharing system everybody has an<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

345
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,200
on inevitably we just do a quick search

346
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,860
now if it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows environment just</font>

347
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:49,880
do a quick quick search on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sheer um</font>

348
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,310
you know just show me a file names with

349
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,380
password in it yeah notably all right at

350
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,840
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop up oh and encrypted passwords</font>

351
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,640
not

352
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">link to company resources but to</font>

353
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,810
personal resources so all unencrypted is

354
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:12,980
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why you people are</font>

355
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this but you do it so stop it okay</font>

356
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,310
so malware doesn't care right so it's

357
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,080
cold heartless thing it it just doesn't

358
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,610
care who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doesn't care what kind</font>

359
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,260
of day you're having it doesn't matter

360
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,750
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the Terminator</font>

361
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:36,270
right he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just he's just after you right</font>

362
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:38,370
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't care so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exploitation is</font>

363
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,680
opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunistic and</font>

364
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:45,330
basically I'll take whatever you give me

365
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,040
so the ona and often times especially on

366
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,240
an internal network that's a lot a lot

367
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff you give me the potentially</font>

368
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,710
exploitable so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often see that</font>

369
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,750
breaches turn into parties and we've

370
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,650
seen this well I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it working</font>

371
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:06,300
incidents and I you can go out on the

372
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,150
internet do a google search and see it

373
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,460
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well there's um you know</font>

374
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:16,140
when one entity breaches a website then

375
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,820
you see others like then they'll

376
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,160
advertise that to their friends whatever

377
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,649
and then others will join in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

378
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,000
start saying so if you get on a

379
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:30,210
compromised website you may see 11

380
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,340
program one web shell that gives us

381
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,720
access but you'll also see like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

382
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,909
see the file structure you see a whole

383
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of other different kinds so it's</font>

384
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:43,950
like everybody brings their own to the

385
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:47,700
party and and they have different

386
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons whatever those are your your</font>

387
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,120
systems

388
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:00,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it when we assess</font>

389
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,389
larger targets just because they're more

390
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,369
complex environments and in the morgue

391
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,978
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime you introduce more complexity to</font>

392
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,168
something it typically tends to be less

393
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:13,229
secure there's more attack points or

394
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:18,929
whatever you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that larger attack</font>

395
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:20,609
service it would be nice as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

396
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,859
of course that's difficult it's easier

397
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:26,820
said than<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the KISS principle keep</font>

398
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:29,369
it simple but so it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep track</font>

399
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,399
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assets you know you're</font>

400
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:34,769
hurting cats with you know proper

401
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:39,958
network that data separation is rarely

402
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:42,059
found you know you've got you've got a

403
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,669
database and you're like oh yeah all are

404
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,200
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> proprietary data all are the</font>

405
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,879
data we care about oh it's in the

406
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,349
database and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching that thing</font>

407
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got it encrypted whatever well</font>

408
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,859
then you also have people actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

409
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,418
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data well guess what they</font>

410
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,099
pull the data out and then oh yeah

411
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,749
they're going to like crunch on it on

412
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,099
their own systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they'll put it</font>

413
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,109
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel spreadsheet or whatever</font>

414
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:09,389
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so now you've lost</font>

415
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:12,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">control of your data like so you know</font>

416
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:14,609
where is your data you know so we have

417
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:16,729
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails go out you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font>

418
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:19,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in print emails right so</font>

419
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,849
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sensitive data so</font>

420
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,349
take like a law firm or something you

421
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,089
know how many law firms encrypt their

422
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:27,239
email to their clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's probably</font>

423
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">some that do but there's probably some</font>

424
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:33,149
that don't what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your mobile phone</font>

425
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,950
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile stuff your phones you know</font>

426
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,589
how much sensitive data you keep on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

427
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:43,169
and you know people obviously lose their

428
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:45,059
phones do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> print data phones so and</font>

429
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,320
they don't be pretty surprised about the

430
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:50,969
amount of information that gets

431
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,889
published on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

432
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:56,999
to to keep keep the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> under control</font>

433
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:59,819
now oftentimes I think in big

434
00:23:56,999 --> 00:24:01,349
organizations there's really this lack

435
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,999
of accountability you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

436
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:03,510
thinks it's somebody else's job to do

437
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:08,130
that

438
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:10,200
whatever it is so so we pretty much

439
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,140
always find though hanging fruit in

440
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:23,700
these environments<font color="#CCCCCC"> low hanging fruit is</font>

441
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:27,420
just easy ways to exploit things and

442
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:30,600
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of exploits you think of</font>

443
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,310
software vulnerabilities but you know

444
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,560
exploits really that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a part of</font>

445
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:37,020
computer security like I know that's the

446
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,550
big sexy<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do</font>

447
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,960
when they're buffer overflows here there

448
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,560
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a whole lot more</font>

449
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,180
to computer security and the gist out

450
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,490
you know there were computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

451
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,500
books written before anybody really even

452
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,180
realized you know buffer overflows

453
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,060
existed you know the moors were my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

454
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,410
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or whatever but you know</font>

455
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,659
there were computer security books

456
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:05,160
before buffer overflows so that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

457
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:09,750
part of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

458
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,740
exploiting trust so you know network

459
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,180
environments have<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in</font>

460
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,000
infrastructure just think of Windows

461
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:18,690
domain so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this trust a lot of</font>

462
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust that goes on so and and we</font>

463
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,400
typically tend to exploit windows trust

464
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,890
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that's the environments</font>

465
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,780
we run into the most though you know

466
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,310
other environments also have trust

467
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,940
relationships that up you know we think

468
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knicks environment you know NFS you</font>

469
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,470
know all the holes I mean they still

470
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that trust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Architecture from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

471
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:45,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years ago or whatever that could</font>

472
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:50,550
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploited now some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's by design</font>

473
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:53,820
just the cost of doing business you know

474
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:57,560
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust entities</font>

475
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,960
here there you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the environment</font>

476
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,820
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah even third parties so you</font>

477
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,480
look the supplier change right so i

478
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:11,550
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was target that got busted no</font>

479
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,670
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Home Depot got buzzed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was an air</font>

480
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,389
conditioning company<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

481
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,040
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those yeah and so</font>

482
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">their their air conditioner you know</font>

483
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,340
company had access into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system and</font>

484
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,280
they you know they hopped attackers hop

485
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:31,850
from from a third party and into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

486
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,160
system because they had this I guess

487
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">24-7 access in which i'm sure they</font>

488
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:41,960
didn't need but for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HVAC folks but</font>

489
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,910
and then then you got you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know back to</font>

490
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing again I'm harping on the fishing</font>

491
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,410
I know it but the trust so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

492
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you click on a phishing email</font>

493
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:55,940
that's a trust you the trusted that

494
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:57,620
right so mobile devices you know cloud

495
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,370
hey let's throw all our data on the

496
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,350
cloud right so do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz you know we</font>

497
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:07,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud then right are</font>

498
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,689
all cloud cloud providers trustworthy

499
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:19,639
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them do</font>

500
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,200
a great job others not so much so you

501
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,890
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to only give as much access</font>

502
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,430
as needed oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big takeaway with</font>

503
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:31,940
trust and we leverage that is once you

504
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:35,300
leverage that trust you look like normal

505
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">so your IDs IPS systems out there</font>

506
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,320
whatever you know was like you're now

507
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,510
you're now normal part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font>

508
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,280
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're the domain</font>

509
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,910
administrator that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

510
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,830
the server box or whatever you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font>

511
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,420
isn't going to fire on that they're like

512
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,419
oh yeah that's yeah they need

513
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,350
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our favorites compliance right so</font>

514
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">check boxes should enroll the day you</font>

515
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,300
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what it</font>

516
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,800
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leads to is you don't see the</font>

517
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,570
force through the trees so you know

518
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,870
you're relying on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these checks right and</font>

519
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,320
you're not really not really thinking

520
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:21,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about things you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not thinking about</font>

521
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:24,060
the potential attack vectors or yeah so

522
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,159
it's kind of a knife<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mind-numbing</font>

523
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,490
exercise you don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

524
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,530
holistically about everything and I

525
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,290
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes the spirit of what was</font>

526
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,660
intended with you know like a PCI

527
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:41,070
compliance or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those is kind of</font>

528
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:43,050
violated your you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Assessor</font>

529
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,139
might say hey you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue on</font>

530
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">this box with this password it sweet</font>

531
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,400
then you don't extrapolate and say oh

532
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,770
you know you take that finding you go oh

533
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,420
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I better check my entire network</font>

534
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,150
for weak passwords and all kinds of

535
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that's just too much work I guess</font>

536
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:03,510
but but that's what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see</font>

537
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,879
you know looking into problem areas so

538
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,980
if you see an area that you've got an

539
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,990
issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> then addressing that across</font>

540
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole environment compliance folks</font>

541
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:20,390
are often aren't technical and so they

542
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:23,220
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite get the you know the</font>

543
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,700
make the right call or understand things

544
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,750
quite right with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the environment</font>

545
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you're performing your due diligence</font>

546
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:34,410
right so it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> good so EMV for PCI</font>

547
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,350
has come along right that's the big

548
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,960
thing chips on pin you know chip and pin

549
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,030
right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great I mean that's</font>

550
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,920
that's driving towards good things but

551
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">it doesn't solve breaches so there's</font>

552
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">plenty of other information unrelated to</font>

553
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,720
you know a credit card number that that

554
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,780
you don't want stolen you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

555
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,530
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity theft with pii the person</font>

556
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,110
they identified

557
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,910
information you know your intellectual

558
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,310
property so the Chinese are stealing

559
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,510
like all your IP right so that doesn't

560
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:09,389
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything to do with credit cards</font>

561
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in that so so you know there should</font>

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">be compliance for other besides credit</font>

564
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,020
different compliance you know and the

565
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,060
hippos and all that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get start</font>

566
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,220
getting that you know they're getting

567
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer but there there little generic</font>

568
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:35,730
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you need to reduce</font>

569
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,400
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack surface as best you can get</font>

rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the unneeded things so you know</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you may have a server that's</font>

00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:47,310
running a service that isn't vulnerable

573
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,020
today but it may be vulnerable to

574
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,460
tomorrow or become aware that's

575
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,560
vulnerable it's always been both but

576
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,470
vulnerable tomorrow so you don't if you

577
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get rid of it right so</font>

578
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,790
reduce the things you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need out of</font>

579
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">your environments you know pretty much</font>

580
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:05,070
figure that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take multiple</font>

581
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:07,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">rounds to fix everything so we'll go in</font>

582
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have repeat customers and you</font>

583
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,890
know they won't have everything fixed

584
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,750
the next time we show up on the doorstep

585
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,980
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I mean as long as</font>

586
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,940
they're working towards that that's

587
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:21,180
that's that's important but it's

588
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,890
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so your environments</font>

589
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:31,110
need to be constantly tested things are

590
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:33,300
you know things change dynamic so you

591
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,149
know putting in a firewall or an ideas

592
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,120
or whatever that's great but that's not

593
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,260
like the the complete solution it's not

594
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,580
you put these things into your

595
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment these products and you're</font>

596
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:53,610
done you know you know they they need to

597
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:55,649
be monitored you know actually take an

598
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,820
advantage of oftentimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not done</font>

599
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,230
but and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be submerged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

600
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,909
still need them you still need a

601
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,310
baseline so AVS the anti viruses I don't

602
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,550
sweat

603
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,260
it's over<font color="#CCCCCC"> any viruses pretty much can</font>

604
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,570
get around<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but you still want them</font>

605
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you still have these you still</font>

606
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,649
want that baseline so just the you know

607
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,350
if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit got phished or whatever</font>

608
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,120
and some stupid virus and it you still

609
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">want that hopefully the AV to get catch</font>

610
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:30,100
it or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still need these</font>

611
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so the cost of things would be</font>

612
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,260
way cheaper as far as security goes if

613
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,090
they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrated into the at</font>

614
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,670
the beginning into the into the

615
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:43,300
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle of things whatever</font>

616
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,850
those things are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but we you'll</font>

617
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,470
see out there and it will continue

618
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:51,189
you'll see this this this vicious cycle

619
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:53,050
so they they put a new product on the

620
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,760
market and inevitably somebody finds

621
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,500
vulnerabilities in it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because</font>

622
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,170
we've just had to get it to market right

623
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,340
as quick as we can we don't care about

624
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:05,530
security so much but yeah and some of

625
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">those presentations for you know like</font>

626
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> automobile stuff today is sort of</font>

627
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,460
one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess yeah it's like up</font>

628
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:16,270
get that automobiles stuff out there or

629
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:19,600
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah we just got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get it</font>

630
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,340
to market and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security yeah so</font>

631
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see it out you'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

632
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:28,409
with new new stuff coming out so learn

633
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,179
from your mistakes takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and effort</font>

634
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,760
do defense in depth so just kind of

635
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,560
assume if you're running a network

636
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,750
environment assume that's going to get

637
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:41,169
compromised the person is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click</font>

638
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:43,510
on the email in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishing then what</font>

639
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,630
what kind of countermeasures what you

640
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:49,300
have in place if a you if a user's inbox

641
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,000
gets compromised are they running at

642
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,590
least privilege you know even if there

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">are there's ways to escalate privilege</font>

644
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:59,409
so so but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep that mind</font>

645
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,649
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mindset of a defense</font>

646
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and depth where you know what if then</font>

647
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:08,380
what do we do type thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so your goal is</font>

648
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to minimize risk not eliminated you'll</font>

649
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">never be able to completely eliminate</font>

650
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,810
the risk but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to minimize it</font>

651
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay before actually before questions</font>

652
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:27,389
let's see all right let's let's get back

653
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:32,489
to my first thing I said about the

654
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:36,589
destruction of mankind so so this guy

655
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:38,790
right here he could be the answer to our

656
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:40,739
computer security problems he could be

657
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,779
the ultimate solution right and so how

658
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:45,719
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you heard about they put IBM</font>

659
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,980
Watson on the computer security whatever

660
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what he's trying to solve</font>

661
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:53,339
but yeah yeah so if you so yeah so let's

662
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:58,170
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> our eye on and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

663
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:59,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution ultimately is to have AI some</font>

664
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,079
of these products<font color="#E5E5E5"> are rolling out with</font>

665
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:06,030
it too but let's think about this for a

666
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,520
minute before we actually do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

667
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:13,020
so a couple of people like Elon Musk and

668
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,829
it was at Stephen Hawking kind of came

669
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,990
out and warned about a i right so

670
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:21,930
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for just a minute the</font>

671
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,000
right like so you're the dominant

672
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,060
species on a planet right and why

673
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,950
because you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your noggin right so</font>

674
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,279
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> create like competitor to that</font>

675
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:34,049
right and like and ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

676
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">really uh you know probably would think</font>

677
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,619
yeah these humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there a</font>

678
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,020
problem they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a</font>

679
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:43,430
problem or they are a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so I</font>

680
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:49,369
don't know why we would develop that but

681
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:49,368
yeah but I guess we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

682
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,730
but yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how much since</font>

683
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:02,299
that makes but but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

684
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:04,609
going does anybody have any questions

685
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,520
yes

686
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:10,680
wait so yeah okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

687
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,640
questions by will interject about the AI

688
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,140
thing yeah they currently we<font color="#CCCCCC"> there dis</font>

689
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,000
coded instructions they are software

690
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,440
that progress in a way that we allow

691
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,109
them to progress so they're only going

692
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,960
to become like a sis artificial super

693
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:26,700
intelligence if we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> let them hear</font>

694
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm glad you made cause it actually this</font>

695
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,169
is the important point I wanted to make

696
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so is it everybody familiar</font>

697
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,010
with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Three Laws of Robotics and</font>

698
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,450
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all right don't</font>

699
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,130
harm humans and all that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

700
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,009
like and we'll probably set all that up

701
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:45,210
and it'll be like yes we the humans will

702
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be harmed right except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ooh unless</font>

703
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a vulnerability right the</font>

704
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,670
computer security so it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

705
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer security there's a hole in the</font>

706
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:56,010
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever and it gets exploited</font>

707
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,590
right by the AI yeah i mean that's we're

708
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:01,260
screwed so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless we get a solution</font>

709
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to computer security right we're going</font>

710
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be destroyed by the AI the whole</font>

711
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,859
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the keynote to is is</font>

712
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">emergent you know i'm predicting so you</font>

713
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,759
could set up three very clear all the

714
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,859
film complexity around them and they

715
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">starve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a runways on in 10 right yep and</font>

716
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:24,170
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we you know that's what you</font>

717
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:28,259
know my team does we we do the

718
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:30,840
unintended or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yeah but you know</font>

719
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,540
though they don't realize you owe you

720
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,240
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or oh you know yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

721
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you know as</font>

722
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,089
humans you don't imagine the AI is doing

723
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,940
it have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if this</font>

724
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,070
works or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not uh do you do more are you</font>

725
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,010
doing more testing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of</font>

726
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Things related devices because you know</font>

727
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,130
we talked a lot about servers and

728
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,609
everybody likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about autonomous</font>

729
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,830
cars but in reality like light bulbs are

730
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,779
starting to be happy run search right

731
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,029
right and those are going to be

732
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,460
prevalent everywhere all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

733
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,440
bitty internet of things are you are you

734
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,570
running more tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't do</font>

735
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,000
so much product it like black box

736
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,859
testing per se we're more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the just</font>

737
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,400
the traditional like what you'd say yeah

738
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:19,299
the net breaking into the network

739
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,270
thinger we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more specific</font>

740
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:25,690
type of testing like that but yeah we in

741
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:28,299
general now we we don't do you think

742
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,960
that will be a bigger a bigger area in

743
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:33,279
the future yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it will be you</font>

744
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,720
know you got the smart meters that

745
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:37,390
they're already hacking away on in the

746
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,529
yeah you know your refrigerator you know

747
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,049
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want your refrigerator</font>

748
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:43,180
attacking you or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know</font>

749
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:44,950
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know or spoiling your</font>

750
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:51,038
meat I mean that's you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you</font>

751
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:53,348
know your sky now right that's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font>

752
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:58,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first indications of Skynet right so</font>

753
00:38:53,349 --> 00:39:00,609
yeah no I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know depending on</font>

754
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:02,380
what you can do you know and they'll say

755
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:03,880
well those there's these failsafe

756
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,980
mechanisms even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something got hacked</font>

757
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,930
yeah I won't be the you know you know

758
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,569
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default is it's benign or</font>

759
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:14,169
whatever but so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like</font>

760
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:18,220
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> signalling systems right so they</font>

761
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:21,400
were a guy told me well you know if

762
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:25,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in there and hack it</font>

763
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,799
pack a traffic signal light<font color="#CCCCCC"> um it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

764
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,598
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> red like you could never turn them</font>

765
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:31,839
all green so everybody smashes into each

766
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,460
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if they all turned red you're</font>

767
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,078
still going to have chaos it's might be

768
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,599
delayed a little bit but everyone

769
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopped right so like it becomes this</font>

770
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:46,020
craziness right still so you know yeah

771
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,920
yeah I think implementing things without

772
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,589
realizing the consequent you know smart

773
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,210
homes those site you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like do</font>

774
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:56,500
we really think of what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

775
00:39:52,210 --> 00:40:04,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what are what the capabilities are</font>

776
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:07,900
any of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah anything else nope</font>

777
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,059
all right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you of the other</font>

778
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,029
low-hanging of the low-hanging fruit

779
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:15,430
options that you find how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

780
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:18,539
are also like<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a rough guess how</font>

781
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:22,569
many of those are also low-hanging fixes

782
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:25,690
versus major riorca textures or

783
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,830
yeah mediation projects it just depends

784
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what it is you know past what</font>

785
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,450
passwords or well we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

786
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,040
non-reusable passwords obviously so yeah

787
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,899
that would be a major fit but we know

788
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,210
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen so changing a</font>

789
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,010
password sure I mean now changing a

790
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,600
password for everyone on the domain when

791
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,880
the domain gets compromised you know

792
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,870
that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit more</font>

793
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,280
difficult undertaking you know the

794
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,740
architecture the underlying architecture

795
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,360
the trust and whatnot you know Microsoft

796
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,220
we've been dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with yeah Microsoft's</font>

797
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,880
been dealing with out for you know

798
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:01,000
whatever decades or whatever so yeah

799
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,530
some things aren't so easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix and of</font>

800
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,270
course my<font color="#E5E5E5"> job's fun because I can just</font>

801
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">say hey fix this and I don't actually</font>

802
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:12,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to fix it so I'm like it's like but</font>

803
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:18,430
yep hope you've got it fixed by the next

804
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:26,560
time I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> around but yeah yeah some</font>

805
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:29,009
are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more yep anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else alright</font>
