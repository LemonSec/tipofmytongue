108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,270
pretty much he pretty much stole my

109
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,039
entire talk so I'm put in a journal

110
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,210
article so before we have a chance to

111
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,010
read that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead and</font>

112
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:05,590
finish the talk up so last June you know

113
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:09,979
the FBI put out an advisory through<font color="#E5E5E5"> ic3</font>

114
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,679
about crypto wall and just stating that

115
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,599
you know crypto wall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its variants</font>

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,720
have been used actively to target us

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,789
victims since april 2014 and the

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,090
financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact of victims goes well</font>

119
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:25,909
beyond the ransom fee itself which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

120
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,789
you know typically 202 $10,000 I've

121
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,010
heard numbers as high as<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

122
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:36,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five thousand dollars depending</font>

123
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:38,629
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

124
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:41,419
the malware developers are able to

125
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:44,330
determine from the infection who they're

126
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:49,400
dealing with and then then you know

127
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:53,688
inflate those fees and so you know as

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,780
we're considering the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

129
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,599
particular type of malware I think it's

130
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:07,609
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a really insightful</font>

131
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:11,389
advisory to kind of keep in mind so how

132
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,069
many folks here have this is maybe your

133
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,270
first time here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cryptolocker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

134
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:24,830
really hope that's not the case anybody

135
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:26,960
okay does anybody care to maybe tell us

136
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about things that they know</font>

137
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,169
about cryptolocker share a few things

138
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:42,550
anybody know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me you</font>

139
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:46,299
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me fly solo today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

140
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:51,349
you know cryptolocker is a crypto

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:55,400
malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ransomware and encrypts</font>

142
00:07:51,349 --> 00:08:00,050
your files holds them for ransom you

143
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,440
know which is by nature extortion that

144
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:06,949
an act of extortion initially released

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:14,770
September 2013 targets all<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of</font>

against these kinds of threats and so

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,540
the advances are are continuing and so

209
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,630
one of the things that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

what are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more recent</font>

213
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,630
developments and how do we protect

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,870
against some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those so looking at the</font>

numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some of these you know in</font>

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:18,040
2014 cryptolocker was infecting over

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,300
being infected and you know one of the

222
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,920
things that's really interesting is you

223
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,290
know how metadata can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,849
determine what what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

225
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,300
infections like this and one of the

226
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:57,040
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is out there is google</font>

227
00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:00,849
search numbers right so search<font color="#E5E5E5"> results</font>

228
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,529
for cryptolocker alone are over 210,000

229
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,670
per month and

230
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:09,269
it's on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rise and you know that's a</font>

231
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good indicator of how how big of</font>

232
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,509
an issue this is for people you don't

233
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,800
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've were</font>

234
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,860
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and search for</font>

235
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,839
cryptolocker on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

looking for an answer to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

237
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:28,439
problem so which brings us to another

238
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:32,309
related issue and that's Mel vertising

239
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:35,849
how many folks the term malvert izing is

240
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,620
new to you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know if you're</font>

241
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,629
not vulnerable enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick your hand</font>

242
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,199
up for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

243
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,999
just tell you that yesterday I made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

244
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:51,059
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes to my presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

245
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'd closed it without saving so so</font>

246
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:56,719
there now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're all sharing openly</font>

247
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,220
so Mel vertising is a malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> al</font>

248
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:08,459
advertisement that's injected through

249
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,250
through an advertisement stream and you

250
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,439
know one of the things that you may be

251
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,449
aware of but may not have a you know

252
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:18,660
occurred to you in light of how these

253
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:21,180
threats are propagated is that many

254
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,939
websites today don't control their

255
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:28,979
advertising stream those ads are served

256
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:32,209
rendered through a third party service

257
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,209
through an external service and then

258
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:39,540
displayed through an iframe or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a script</font>

259
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:43,018
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort on their website and they</font>

260
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,990
really have next to no control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over what</font>

261
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:53,189
is being displayed there that has become

262
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">an excellent vector for infection an</font>

263
00:14:53,189 --> 00:15:00,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">excellent way to serve up our our</font>

264
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:03,059
malicious software the developers have

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,819
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and are using that and</font>

266
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:09,329
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has really become somewhat of an</font>

the real cyber pandemic because one of

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,140
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I've been following</font>

272
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:27,370
recently is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI vs apple case so</font>

273
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,260
who's also watching FBI vs apple and the

274
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,890
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you know coming in the</font>

275
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,569
wake of that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just found it kind of</font>

276
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,860
comical that you know one of the things

277
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we had had heard was we need to</font>

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:47,320
unlock the iPhone because it may it may

279
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:50,070
contain a cyber pathogen so so I had put

280
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,400
on here you know the real cyber pathogen

281
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:57,100
because it was found later that you know

282
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,260
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that the the iphone didn't</font>

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,460
really in question didn't really contain

284
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:08,470
a cyber pathogen you know so these types

285
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:13,440
of things are you know the severity of

286
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:18,970
this threat is has led to FBI advisory

287
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:21,520
has led to other things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,069
find it interesting that sixty-nine

291
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,560
percent of Fortune 500 websites use

292
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,210
external javascript to render portions

293
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,599
of their websites you know we talked

294
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:46,660
about malvert izing and how JavaScript

295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,480
can play into that sixty-four percent of

296
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:55,300
them of those sites running outdated web

297
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,670
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you know one of the apps</font>

298
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,670
that comes to mind you know is WordPress

299
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,280
there's there's a there's a cold fusion

300
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,050
there's a there's a long list you know

301
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:12,010
of those types of things but I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

302
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:16,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we we've got some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

303
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,530
to handle in advising companies with

304
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:23,198
this type of capital of how to implement

305
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">just common practices keeping those</font>

306
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,059
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to date</font>

307
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:35,600
and and filtering external content so

308
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:38,670
we've done some case studies through

309
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,020
through you know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers at</font>

310
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">tech links one of the things that we've</font>

311
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,680
seen is that we're still seeing among

312
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:56,250
our customers one infection per month

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:18:03,890
and on average over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past year or</font>

314
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">more over five cases in 2015 alone and</font>

316
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,670
percent of those which may look as you

317
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,760
know a disproportionately high number of

318
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:23,040
infections but of the customers that we

319
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:26,910
serve that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a representative</font>

320
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,490
number of even across every vertical so

321
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,429
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one particular vertical that's</font>

322
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,590
being affected most by this it's every

323
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,750
vertical every industry is being

324
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,220
affected equally it just so happens that

325
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,900
it tech links we have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

326
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:46,530
customers than other customers so if

327
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,260
you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care you're just as</font>

328
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:55,970
likely as any other industry and vice

329
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:58,710
versa to to be targeted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cryptolocker</font>

330
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so you know we talked about the</font>

331
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:04,160
motivation earlier it's mainly financial

332
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:09,270
these these developers are looking for

333
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,790
money through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin moneypak a single</font>

334
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:15,530
instance could make over 250 thousand

335
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:21,510
dollars in a month within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a corporation</font>

336
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:24,139
and crypto wall has resulted in over a

337
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:28,020
million dollars paid out and ransoms and

338
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:32,370
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're after the information</font>

339
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,800
they're after the money but most of all

340
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it's just been easy</font>

341
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,080
for these developers to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

342
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:46,480
this despite law enforcement action

343
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,870
against these developers so here's a

344
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">little history about cryptolocker you</font>

345
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,399
know it's gone by many names so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind</font>

346
00:19:52,450 --> 00:20:03,820
of started with just plain cryptolocker

347
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:08,380
moved on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> F family in 2014 we saw</font>

348
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:11,230
the crit Ronnie<font color="#E5E5E5"> variants the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revit on</font>

349
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">variants crowd II otherwise referred to</font>

350
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:18,120
as crypto wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> three last fall saw we</font>

351
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:22,659
saw crypto wall for come with a major

352
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:26,770
major change in the splash screen change

353
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:31,180
in functionality and then last fall we

354
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:36,370
also saw the first Linux variant come

355
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:40,060
with Linux encoder one so you know the

356
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the linux unix platforms are no longer</font>

357
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">safe from this some more recent trends</font>

358
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,620
that we've seen is ransomware using rdp

359
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:57,750
to spread android ransomware

360
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:04,600
communicating over XMPP tour switchers

361
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:09,210
to help decentralize traffic in you know

362
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:12,850
obfuscate the origin of the attack and

363
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,660
anonymize protect the developer and the

364
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,850
command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control network from</font>

365
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,880
discovery and isolation we've seen

366
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,500
browser mobile and eunuch<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux variants</font>

367
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:31,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest thing</font>

368
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,910
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have extortion on this slide but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

369
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,120
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more of</font>

370
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:40,240
a specific terminology to discuss this

371
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,120
because you know ransom you know

372
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,780
demanding a ransom is extortion and so

373
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,209
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really very very specific and</font>

374
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,830
so

375
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:54,389
one of the trends that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect us to</font>

376
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:57,609
see is what i'm calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> leak where and</font>

377
00:21:54,389 --> 00:22:02,590
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm expecting for us to see in</font>

378
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:05,049
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak where is that if you choose</font>

379
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,840
if you're infected and you choose not to

380
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:11,710
pay the ransom that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data will be</font>

381
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:16,749
leaked in a WikiLeaks kind of fashion or

382
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:19,330
similar to you know the threats that

383
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:21,399
we've seen through big breaches like the

384
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,158
sony breach you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:26,559
splatter you all over pay spin if you

386
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,499
don't pay whatever we demand from you

387
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:34,149
and a couple of my peers have pointed

388
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:36,629
out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> X filtration is an issue so you</font>

389
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:39,599
know well what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> X filtration and</font>

390
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:44,668
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that's a valid point</font>

391
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:48,820
however if you were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

392
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:51,279
defend against this threat and you

393
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">weren't able to remediate it before the</font>

394
00:22:51,279 --> 00:23:00,149
encryption action was complete I

395
00:22:54,479 --> 00:23:05,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">question highly your ability to limit</font>

396
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:10,508
port 80 or 443<font color="#E5E5E5"> exfiltration of this data</font>

397
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,879
so does anybody have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

398
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:14,289
will give you a teacher if you say

399
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:20,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">something so that I can take a drink of</font>

400
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:20,879
water nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

401
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:32,929
so crypto wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> three you know encrypts</font>

402
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:37,160
files displays ransom or a lock screen

403
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:40,220
and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of as a long list of</font>

404
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:44,510
signatures by various vendors talking

405
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:53,330
about their particular signature for

406
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:54,980
that for the for crypto wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> three as</font>

407
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most vendors are</font>

408
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,690
doing something in this area some are

409
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,720
doing more and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

410
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a little bit more later in the</font>

411
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,830
presentation but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some really</font>

412
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:12,860
more advanced than just an anti virus

413
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,280
signature ways that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors are</font>

414
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,979
developing to try to combat this which i

415
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is great because we have to do</font>

416
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:28,760
something as a matter of fact several

417
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:33,679
big firewall vendors teamed up last year

418
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,840
to do a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal of threat research</font>

419
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:43,010
around crypto wall and they came out

420
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:48,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a report in q4 called the the</font>

421
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:50,929
crypto wall report threat report and of

422
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,240
that they came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some pretty</font>

423
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,100
staggering statistics maybe even more

424
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,830
staggering than what we've talked about

425
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:05,260
so far and among those are an estimated

426
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:09,460
325 million dollar dollars in damages

427

and over<font color="#CCCCCC"> four thousand unique samples</font>

434
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,710
and then after all that research we saw

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:52,250
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw some some interesting</font>

437
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:55,000
changes encrypting file names and the

438
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,640
type which was new because previously

439
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,520
one of the remediation techniques was to

440
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,090
identify the types of the files<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been encrypted to to kind of</font>

442
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,350
tabulate what damage had been done now

443
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,260
even the extensions had been encrypted

444
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:20,270
which made it much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

445
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:28,550
remediate the threat and an HTML ransom

446
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:32,870
note re couching the the way that the

447
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:37,100
threat had encrypted that information in

obviously going after people's hosted

465

only included a limited file extension

list which was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I kind of look</font>

467
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:48,890
at this as like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roll out</font>

468
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,770
no the developers is very early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there</font>

469
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,080
they're going after<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-hanging fruit</font>

470
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:56,030
and trying to hit people where it's

471
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,850
going to hurt them the most so I just

472
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make a quick pitch for my buddy</font>

479
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:21,860
the things that r us is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

480
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:28,510
about is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> module that can be used in</font>

481
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">powershell to test distribution of</font>

482
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:34,250
crypto malware and so you guys will want

483
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,690
to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

484
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,410
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the back</font>

485
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:41,240
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well you know Russ you might</font>

486
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,870
want to you know say a couple more words

487
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,200
so if you're at this talk and you show

488
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,139
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there Russ might have some some</font>

489
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,920
goodies<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you something delicious</font>

490
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,070
information or something maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

491
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,650
so how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this you know the</font>

492
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,950
cyber threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance report revealed</font>

493
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:06,820
that sixty-seven percent of infections

494
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,670
were the result of phishing attacks and

495
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:14,389
thirty percent were the result of

496
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:17,120
exploit kits so obviously we've got a

497
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:24,110
lot more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done in the area of</font>

498
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:26,419
what user education you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have got</font>

499
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,179
a shirt earlier because you raised your

500
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:32,240
hand earlier so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go user</font>

501
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:36,680
education basics right I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

502
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,920
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first weakness that you</font>

503
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,380
know

504
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:43,310
we've identified over and over again you

505
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:47,410
can't fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid right so we've got a</font>

506
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:52,399
lot more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in user education</font>

507
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:56,390
and fishing awareness and and you know

508
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll i recant my statement a little bit</font>

509
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:03,770
by saying that these fishing campaigns

510
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:06,950
are incredibly incredibly smart almost

511
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,800
indistinguishable from the genuine

512
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:13,460
article and it takes a keen keen eye to

513
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,940
identify you know when this is being

514
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,740
used and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maybe you've been the</font>

515
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">root you know the victim of a fishing</font>

517
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:30,140
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay come see me later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give</font>

518
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:34,360
you a hug so here's a little kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

519
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,280
chart showing what the phishing email

520
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,439
you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of process or chain would</font>

521
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,850
look like I'm sorry for you folks in the

522
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,550
back that this is you know that's

523
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,959
probably hard for you to see I tried to

524
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:50,960
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bigger but I couldn't you know</font>

525
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:56,290
the victim you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know through vulnerable</font>

526
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:02,840
browser and redirection is you know is

527
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:06,139
presented with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious server then</font>

528
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,020
redirected again to an angler or other

529
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,280
compromised server they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

530
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:18,080
the exploit kit page which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:20,660
then check for virtual machine and

532
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,570
security products so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in the</font>

533
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:27,140
most recent versions these the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

534
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">is sandbox aware right so anybody go</font>

535
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:37,690
into bypassing sandboxing later this

536
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,690
afternoon okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> also related and then</font>

537
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:46,190
if the sandbox is detected we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> exiting</font>

538
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:50,330
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript exception exception</font>

541
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:58,939
the compromise of the system which is

542
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,279
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty smart so these you know</font>

543
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,909
the developers are finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to keep</font>

544
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:11,990
their code from even being examined in a

00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:14,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">sandbox environment exploit kits here's</font>

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,149

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:24,320
identified campaigns their corresponding

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:26,539
exploit kits additional you know in

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:33,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to angler magnitude neutrino</font>

551
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:41,570
well so earlier I talked a little bit

552
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:46,730
about malvert Iseman and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

553
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tides in here and that is really you</font>

554
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:53,210
know what is feeding the drive-by

555
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:56,240
download mechanism and here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

556
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,360
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a chart from Microsoft talking</font>

557
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,610
about drive-by downloads in detail and

558
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:07,820
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the iframe or</font>

559
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript that's hosting that that</font>

560
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:15,260
malvert Iseman would become the

561
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:18,019
mechanism within the drive-by download

562
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:21,559
for that software to be served up or

563
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that script to be run so this relates</font>

564
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:28,850
you know to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous page where as</font>

565
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,129
kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional layer of serving</font>

566
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,149
up this and then directing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user's</font>

567
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">browser toward that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command and control</font>

568
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network</font>

569
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:52,780
I put this at slide in because a lot of

570
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:55,479
times when we r you know online<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

571
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:58,450
of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get in this in</font>

572
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:02,110
this mode of<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicking through material</font>

573
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,570
and that can very quickly lead to this

574
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,550
drive-by download situation you end up

575
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,239
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that article looks</font>

576
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:12,820
interesting but it's served up by a

this malvert izing is a silent killer

593
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:18,569
doesn't really require any type of user

594
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:21,370
interaction to propagate the the malware

595
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,550
just browsing to that website viewing

596
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:28,210
the ads having you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

one of causes it to become infected and

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,600
you're running as admin domain admin not

601
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:50,140
using enhanced security controls nobody

602
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:52,089
does that so you know essentially web

603
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,700
browsing it is now

604
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:59,080
you know a big big issue as it relates

605
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and one of the problems it's led</font>

606
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,420
to this is just our advertising economy

607
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,419
right so it's a complex economy buying

608
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,140
selling of advertisements many websites

609
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,220
are sponsored you know by wet by

610
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,960
advertisement you know we've known for a

00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time that Google's main business is</font>

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,330
advertisement not search you know and so

613
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:29,200
anybody here from google I heard there's

614
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:31,120
someone here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google today but yeah</font>

615
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">we wish we were all raising our hands</font>

616
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,430
right and then you know this but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

617
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that Google does do a good</font>

618
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:41,710
job of is screening advertisements

619
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,990
whereas other websites may not do that

620
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,840
type of diligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so what we</font>

621
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">really need is industry partners that</font>

622
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,810
work closely together to detect these

623
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:55,210
kinds of threats and keep them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

624
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:58,270
our you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet economy keep them</font>

625
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:01,330
out of our web browsers and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

626
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:10,980
we can see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come as time</font>

627
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:10,980
goes on but probably not yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

628
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:20,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of third-party</font>

629
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:23,840
advertising and this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big concern</font>

630
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:27,630
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us do you have any recommendations</font>

631
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:31,500
that we could all<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to do a better job</font>

632
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:35,000
keeping bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> mal were tossing off um I</font>

633
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't happy to get back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you on that</font>

634
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,600
that's talking more about that yeah so

635
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,410
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your comment yes sir so if</font>

636
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,430
I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're saying</font>

637
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,339
correctly the mal vertising is actually

638
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,180
being hosted through legitimate

639
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,680
advertising companies it's not like

640
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,649
somebody's hacking the site and sending

641
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,839
it off into<font color="#CCCCCC"> someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we already it's</font>

642
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,400
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they place an ad they happen to</font>

643
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,630
stick the link in there to the X plate

644
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,870
know if you go right wow so of the you

645
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">know 336,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I made on my last campaign</font>

I reinvest 20,000 in an advertising

647
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,310
campaign that's malicious and now all of

648
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,250
a sudden I've served up you know an

649

additional you know 1.5 million

650
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,740
malicious ads that's not I mean that's

651
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,690
money well that's money well spent right

652
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,520
for the developer so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know as</font>

653
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,040
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robin pointed out is something that</font>

654
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,170
we'd all like to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about its</font>

655
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,750
question of how we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so it</font>

656
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,540
requires you know an industry coming

657
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:42,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and talking about that so and I</font>

658
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,720
will get back to you Robin on so yeah

659
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">file system mods cryptolocker is saving</font>

660

itself with a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> file name which</font>

661
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,130
makes it hard to detect creating

00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,290
autostart entries in the system

663
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:00,570

664
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:04,080
mode hijacking exe extensions to delete

665
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:06,480
shadow volume copies and the linchpin of

666
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,660
the shadow valium copies is on your desk

667
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,590
tops this is what allows you to do a

668
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,720
system restore so if you don't have your

669
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,100
shadow volume copies available you're

670
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically going to get a message that</font>

671
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,470
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh can't do a system restore and</font>

675
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:33,749
very few very few probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea</font>

678
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:47,459
business as you know it then maybe a

679
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:50,309
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea your computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so for</font>

680
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:53,578
us techies how it works we download the

681
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:57,660
encryption keys encrypt the files and

682
00:39:53,579 --> 00:40:01,969
then demand the ransom here's a pink cap

683
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,969
of of that action

684
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:24,220
you can see the proxies in work as well

685
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:36,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">as the the tour switchers being used to</font>

686
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:41,950
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of redirect that traffic we get</font>

687
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:44,569
our encryption keys and establish

688
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,848
connection through a domain generation

689
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:49,310
algorithm this is what one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

690
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:54,589
that's making it very difficult to block

691
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:58,299
cryptolocker through that that most

692
00:40:54,589 --> 00:41:03,349
relied upon NSA top 15 information

693
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:09,730
assurance mechanism domain whitelisting

694
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:09,730
were reputation filtering like Open DNS

695
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:18,920
you know maybe a checkpoint or other

696
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:22,220
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out there it's now not</font>

697
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,900
effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> where as effective because of</font>

698
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,990
the domain generation algorithm

699
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,609
component the malware connects and

700
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,410
downloads a public key to the windows

701
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:32,029
system configuration and then the

702
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,819
private key is saved to the command and

703
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:38,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">control server and this is of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:40,790
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't find the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key we need</font>

705
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,710
to decrypt from the local system it's

706
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:47,720
just not there here's a list of file

707
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,980
extensions that cryptolocker is looking

708
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,669
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know this is really hard to read</font>

709
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,520
so you can check it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> later when it's</font>

710
00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:00,050
done encrypting these files is when

711
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,670
you're presented with the the ransom

712
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,290
note<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you may not even know the</font>

713
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:07,310
encryption is going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside from</font>

714
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:12,859
indicators like high cpu load high

715
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:16,130
memory utilization exactly yeah so

716
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:19,609
resource monitoring it then becomes an

717
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:26,760
early indicator as well as

718
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:30,410
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID s so as mentioned</font>

719
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier draw files are now target and</font>

720
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:36,990
interestingly enough even as of this

721
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:40,890
week cryptolocker is now going after map

722
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:43,410
drives first so there may not even be an

discovering this through their sim

products are out there with signatures

talking that that will help you detect

737
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:27,480
the traffic initially and then they're

738
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:29,579
finding that their local files are

739
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,339

this monitoring correlation services are

again we're routing these things through

773
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:35,609
a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different mechanisms that</font>

774
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:39,220
make it much more difficult to detect

775
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:43,299
local ransom note files are also an

776
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:47,080
indicator here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some frequently left</font>

777
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:52,270
behind extensions and file names these

778
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:55,540
can be searched using scripts to alert

779

detect an alert and even shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

780
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:03,700
system but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developers have you know</font>

781
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,290
identified that this is how one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

782
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,549
ways that we're detecting this and so

783
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:15,060
they're dropping these files at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

784
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:17,980
which then decreases our time to react

785
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:20,980
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the scanning using</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerShell script file screen management</font>

787
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,760
with audit rules can be useful and it's

788
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,880
important to note that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

789
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:35,790
work in combination to bring your

790
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:40,359
detection time down you know some

791
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:43,090
detection have gone over five days you

792
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:44,538
know or more so how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

793
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,509
backups more

794
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:49,489
fine days yeah most people are doing

795
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:51,289
backups more often than five days so

796
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:55,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means that if you do a backup every</font>

797
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:57,919
20 every two days you would have rolled

798
00:46:55,539 --> 00:47:02,529
encrypted files to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> backups twice</font>

799
00:46:57,919 --> 00:47:06,879
during that time period at least right

800
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:13,219
yeah in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 per month for a year</font>

801
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:19,579
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you stop exactly yeah so but</font>

802
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:21,679
rolling to backup is no bueno so here we

803
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:24,679
you know come back to this user

804
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:27,099
awareness training is key not<font color="#E5E5E5"> running as</font>

user<font color="#E5E5E5"> account controls doesn't really</font>

807

apply your path app data so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where a software restriction</font>

using software restriction policies in

811
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:45,859
their in their business today highly

812
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:49,189
recommend software restriction policy or

worth your time especially on terminal

know additional things to do can't you

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,050
know what we were saying common security

obviously you know attending a talk like

this helps raise all of our

00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:15,029
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a professional</font>

870
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:16,650
remediation is key here restoring from

871
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:21,270
incremental backup we talked a little

872
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:23,670
bit about that using utilities and

873
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:25,259
regaining access to your files I have a

874
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,200
list of utilities I'm going to provide

875
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys with as part of my resources</font>

876
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:36,118
that I've talked about retrieving<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys</font>

877
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:38,310
online these you know these networks are

878
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,650
being taken down by law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

879
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:44,820
the time keys are constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

880
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:48,330
published and so there is hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> even you</font>

881
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:51,030
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road of recovering from an</font>

882
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,710
infection<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this even if there</font>

883
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:59,670
weren't incremental backups available

884
00:51:52,710 --> 00:52:01,680
even if you didn't pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ransom for</font>

885
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,770
those desktops that aren't built aren't

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:08,819
backed up rebuilding from gold image

887
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:11,570
wipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine it's not just</font>

888
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:15,300
cryptolocker that we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

889
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:19,080
cryptolocker comes with other things

890
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,760
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blackshades remote access tool and</font>

891
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,770
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan downloaders that can be</font>

892
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,170
very very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify and</font>

893
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">remove and you know because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

894
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:32,609
early reaction is really essential in

895
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,920
earlier versions disconnecting from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

896
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:35,790
net

897
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,800
work was shown to stop the encryption

898
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:44,800
algorithm process it's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer the</font>

899
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:48,340
case really a hard shutdown is what's

900
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:52,240
needed pull that drive and mounted

901
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:54,610
externally and then attempt to decrypt

902
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,379
and salvage what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible in an</font>

903
00:52:54,610 --> 00:53:04,870
isolated environment reimage a restore

904
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:08,320
our files is is the way to go here so as

905
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned earlier save that what can't</font>

906
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,870
be decrypted to offline storage in case

907
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,920
the keys are you know later published

908
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:20,350
out and I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> how law enforcement</font>

909
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is taken down these networks on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

910
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:32,980
ongoing basis so with that questions you

911
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,690
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart the algorithm for</font>

912
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">cryptolocker is for example could I do</font>

913
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:40,450
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like make a samba share and do</font>

914
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,399
like a link to itself and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll go</font>

915
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:44,080
after the samba share sort of a honey

916
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,210
pot black hole yeah and it'll just

917
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,470
recurse itself to death<font color="#CCCCCC"> in his trap it</font>

918
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:54,250
yeah so that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown to be an</font>

919
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective mechanism in slowing down the</font>

920
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:03,220
process and you know at freaknic last

921
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:05,740
fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard a really interesting talk</font>

922
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:09,359
called analog security there's a book

923
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:12,310
out about it and the whole premise is

924
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:16,330
security is time-based and an

925
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:19,000
increasingly complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualized high</font>

926
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:21,549
performance environment we have now

927
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,460
become so fast that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> exceed our</font>

928
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,860
ability to react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that and so what</font>

929
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,990
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is a way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slowing</font>

930
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,790
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infection long enough maybe</font>

931
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,250
long enough to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself by yourself</font>

932
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:36,520
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dislike to notice yeah</font>

933
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,830
yeah it's not yet smart enough to know

934
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,759
that it's been given<font color="#CCCCCC"> a honey directory</font>

935
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:42,399
or whatever you

936
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:44,639
want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so a micro honey pot of</font>

937
00:54:42,399 --> 00:54:47,499
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the best of my knowledge</font>

938
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:52,509
okay cool thank you here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my resources</font>

939
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:56,979
again clean QR codes so you guys I'm

940
00:54:52,509 --> 00:55:12,579
serious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the slides will be up</font>

941
00:54:56,979 --> 00:55:14,618
on SlideShare yes one of my buddies<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran</font>

942
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:17,979
across one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their sites and one of</font>

943
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:20,079
their clients ended up with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

944
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:22,479
actually was already seeing the shares

945
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,949
even though they weren't mapped<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font>

946
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:25,509
actually was running through picking up

947
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:27,789
the shares live on the network and

948
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:29,829
hunting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and this client had</font>

949
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,969
made a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake and the person who God</font>

950
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:33,189
had had more privileges than he should

951
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:35,409
have so it ate up a whole bunch of stuff

952
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:37,388
but she didn't have a map map shares to

953
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:39,009
it so the mappings becoming less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

954
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:42,099
problem it's learning how to go find its

955
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:44,949
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks for sharing that</font>
