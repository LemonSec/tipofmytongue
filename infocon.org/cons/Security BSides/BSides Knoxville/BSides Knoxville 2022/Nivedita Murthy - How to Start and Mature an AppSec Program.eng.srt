1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,159
all right

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,359
hi everyone um okay it's visible

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
all right

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
well uh my name is niveda murthy you can

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,920
of it all about me i'm an associate

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,880
principal consultant at synopsis um i've

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,519
been in this industry for 13 years now

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
so it's not like i've just come out of

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,359
you know college and talking about the

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
whole abstract program i have some

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
experience talking to different

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,280
organizations trying to set up their

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
abstract program working through it and

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,160
now i've been focused on devsicops for

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
the past few years at least

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,280
as part of my job i have to script a lot

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,680
which is my favorite part and to create

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
out-of-box solutions um i've done a

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
couple of speaking engagements over the

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,440
past few years and which includes quite

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
a few b-sides um in other locations i've

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
also been i'm actually one of the

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
organizers for boston security meetup so

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960

[Music]

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
and finally your proud dog mom

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
this is the first time my dog has come

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
over here

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,400
has been on a plane so he's enjoying it

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
out here

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
um but let's dive into the talk now

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
so what do we have on our agenda today

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
um we first start with the inventory

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
itself

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
application inventory to be precise

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
if you are to start an application

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
security program you need to know what

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
you are protecting you can't just go in

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,159
blind and start something out there

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,720
another important aspect for any program

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,439
is metrics um you probably heard this

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,799
several times

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
security is a cost center

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,759
an organization does not make any money

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,719
through security uh it can intangibly

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
prevent losses

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,360
so how does security show return of

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
investment

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
while waiting for that once in a while

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
security attack to happen

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
next is technology

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
uh the tools that help us get this done

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
the tool that actually helps run an

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,360
appsec program

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
and then there is governance policies

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
and standards

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
that give teeth to this program and that

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
can establish that this has leadership

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,280
approval

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
and then at last we talk about quick

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
wins

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,360
we are in 2022 and just about everyone

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,480
here has short attention span including

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
i mean i i can say i have a short

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
attention span um it is the age of

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
instant gratification

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
so to convince your sponsors or rather

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
your leadership

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
your program needs some quick wins

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,879
so what is an application inventory

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
in simple terms it's a data set of all

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
the applications that the organization

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
uses

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,319
now if you need to start your appsec

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
program

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
you need to know what you are protecting

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
what applications does your organization

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
develop what applications do you buy uh

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
from others where are they hosted where

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
what does it handle out there what data

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,319
does it handle an application inventory

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
helps you determine

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,879
easily in case of security notifications

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,599
um you know that in case of like who

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
could be potentially impacted and

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
application inventory helps tie back the

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
responsibility of security

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
vulnerabilities to the right team and

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
then

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
the application leader itself

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
an inventory health security team plan

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,040
and organize appsec initiatives uh if

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
you had to find all the applications you

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,120
know being hosted on a server that is

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
vulnerable you can use the inventory for

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,159
the same

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
um

108
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,280
sorry

109
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,370
[Music]

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
um and then you can use the same thing

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,120
to you know figure out who to be

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
contacted asap you didn't have to go

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,560
through dig through

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
and check out like do you know who owns

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
this application do you know who owns

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
the server do you know who owns this

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
particular section or network you know

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
run a network scan and find out the ip

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
address associated who raised the ticket

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
associated to this ip address you don't

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,479
have to do that and inventory gives you

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
direct access to all of that contact

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
information

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
if you're a large organization an

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
application inventory also helps

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
segregate the risk by division or the

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
verticals that you have in your

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
organization

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
so what do you ex what data should you

130
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
expect in an application inventory um

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
let's start with the basics

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
business criticality externally facing

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
data confidentiality and technical and

134
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
business contacts rtos dr procedures etc

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,639
and then number of users whether it's

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
developed internally and or externally

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
like do you have you know

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
we have it procured from someone else or

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
is this something developed internally

140
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
by your own developers

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
with this information one can determine

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
how critical the application is to the

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
organization

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
example an organization would rather run

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
pentest on externally facing

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
applications only

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,120
since you know printers are expensive

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
and externally facing applications are

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
at a higher risk compared to your

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
internal ones um exercise

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
vulnerabilities have a higher impact on

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
externally facing applications versus

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
internal applications application

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,400
metadata can be used to determine the

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
actual severity of an application versus

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
like instead of the one determined by a

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,800
scanning tool so you can start the

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,320
inventory with the basic level of

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,520
metadata out here

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
then you can also you know enable it to

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
trigger processes uh that are part of an

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,039
app onboarding process uh a mature

163
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,919
application inventory uh and process can

164
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
and database can also notify when an

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,800
application is due for audits uh such as

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
bcp and dr checks uh and even security

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
scans you can actually set this up quite

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
a few organizations have already this

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
you know in their inventory out there

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
um

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
in the latest trends uh organizations

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,039
are also trying to include a bomb or

173
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,440
bill of materials uh just to show off

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
hands how many of you have heard of this

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
term bom

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
a bomb or bill of materials so you know

177
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
what it is a little bit you could say

178
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,039
we've been hearing about this through

179
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,680
lock4j attacks in case if you have heard

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,560
um but essentially you can also include

181
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
this as part of your inventory so you

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
have a much bet accurate view of what

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,919
the organization actually

184
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
controls or has in its you know network

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
out there what is it storing out there

186
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,919
um

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
does that mean this is a one-time

188
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
activity um once all the data is

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
captured uh should it be left out like

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,759
that

191
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
like any other data it becomes stale

192
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
over time

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
and people come and go applications also

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
change they change state they change

195
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
activities some applications just get

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
decommissioned and it takes time how

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
many of you have heard this term oh the

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
application is actually getting

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
decommissioned and you've heard this

200
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
thing happening for five years at least

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
i've heard it for five years

202
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,599
um

203
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
and as such there needs to be a process

204
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
to audit all of this information and

205
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
ensure the data in the inventory is

206
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
accurate so that your processes don't

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
get stopped out there um a typical way

208
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
to do this is to trigger a review every

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
one or two years

210
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
and some organizations have done it

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
based on criticality so if it's a

212
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
critical application they review it

213
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
every year if it's

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,280
maybe a medium application then every

215
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,638
three years and so on so forth

216
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
so what tools would you use to set this

217
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
up

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
if you are at the beginner level i would

219
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,919
just say go with a simple excel sheet

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,479
honestly the best way to start it out is

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,759
an excerpt because it's under your

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
control you don't have to pay for it

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
it's already installed and

224
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,560
you have it ready if you go and try and

225
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
buy a tool you have to go through

226
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,319
procurement you have to grow through

227
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
legal you have to go through leadership

228
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,800
to get the buy-in for that so start off

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
with an excel if you have to

230
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,280
um and then post it on something like

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
you know on a storage service or like a

232
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
sharepoint excel maybe you know so

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,319
others can contribute to it make it

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,759
available to others so that you can keep

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,800
a track

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
um and it's just not one person

237
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
maintaining that excel you have quite a

238
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
few teams maintaining that excel at the

239
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,839
same time

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
while it's tedious and manual work you

241
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
can at least start it off and more

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,080
importantly you have a good view of your

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
application portfolio you have something

244
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
in hand ready

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
in terms of actual tools there is

246
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
servicenow

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,640
compass

248
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
remedy and fresh service that i bought

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
from my own interactions with different

250
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,360
organizations but there are quite a few

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
tools in the market choose wisely what

252
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,319
works for you

253
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
so after all of what i've said here

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
let's have an opinion poll uh we have

255
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
quite a few people out here

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
do you think a product company with just

257
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
a few products in their portfolio needs

258
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
an inventory

259
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
let's say yes okay yes

260
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
quite a few good hands okay can one of

261
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
you just let me know why

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,160
and what do you consider few products

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah go ahead

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,000
right but i have an example of a company

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
which had just two products

266
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,839
does this company need an inventory

267
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,880
yes okay why

268
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
yeah

269
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
good that's great

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
so that's why we need an inventory

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
because even if it's one product even if

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
it's one product it's not exactly one

273
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
small product is end-to-end services

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,079
being provided through that single

275
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,480
product out there and when it comes to

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
development

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
you are going through several end points

278
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
to finally deliver that product by

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
deliver a functionality of that product

280
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
so yes you still need an inventory

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
all right

282
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
next topic what is metric

283
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,079
um

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
actually if you wanted to try it out if

285
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
you run a google search right now at

286
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
least this work for me

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
for the word metric just the word metric

288
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
the first result that actually pops up

289
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
is a canadian rock band it is not the

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
meaning it's not the definition of

291
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,880
metric it is actually a canadian rock

292
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
band which was there

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
but to most serious conversations out

294
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
here um it is essentially a system of

295
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
measurement in terms of business it's an

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,720
intangible way of showing results

297
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
um what would you consider a good

298
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
security metric uh let's discuss the

299
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,320
obvious ones anything that talks about

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
vulnerability summaries it's a metric

301
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
note that you should also be ready with

302
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
a conclusion or implications of a metric

303
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,200
examples of metrics include total number

304
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
of vulnerabilities

305
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
by severity

306
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
or new vulnerabilities found every month

307
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,120
by severity um

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
the same numbers can be filtered down to

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
an organization level or to a division

310
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
level or subdivision level uh then next

311
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,480
date your next point here should be what

312
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
is the pain point that we are trying to

313
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,920
uh highlight here with this metric okay

314
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
uh or what successes are we trying to

315
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,800
showcase out here uh with this with

316
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
vulnerabilities by severity uh you are

317
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
trying to point out the risk level of an

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,800
organization

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,079
but then

320
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,880
you could also be then um

321
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
sorry if a majority of the

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
vulnerabilities are of medium or medium

323
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
severity then does that mean the

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
organization is doing slightly better

325
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
than let's say other organizations out

326
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,279
there in the uh you know in your

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,440
industry or

328
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
by

329
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
basically not having so many higher

330
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
critical vulnerabilities or could it be

331
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
that because of your team's bandwidth

332
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
you're only focusing on critical and

333
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,480
high vulnerabilities you're actually

334
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,839
just triaging critical and high

335
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,360
vulnerabilities you're not even looking

336
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
at medium vulnerabilities that way you

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,240
have actually reduced the actual uh true

338
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
positives i mean these are true positive

339
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,959
numbers you never looked at medium and

340
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,440
there could be the case that those

341
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
medium numbers that you see are actually

342
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
false positives out there that could

343
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
also be the case because these numbers

344
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,959
are coming from scanning tools and we

345
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,800
all know when you run automated scanning

346
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
tools

347
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,480
they have false positives so

348
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
it's not necessary that this number

349
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,399
accurately reflects

350
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
unless and until you go into the details

351
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
on how this one how are the metrics

352
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,959
captured

353
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
another example of a metric and trying

354
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,880
to explain the context behind it is

355
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
think about scan times

356
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
okay when we talk about scan times we

357
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,880
talk about average kind times out there

358
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,760
as a metric but would it be fair to club

359
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
scan times for let's say

360
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
all apps

361
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,519
under one average uh when you say think

362
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
about apps that are like

363
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
500k llc when i say loc it's line of

364
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,279
code um versus microservices which are

365
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
really small when you run any sort of

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
security scan on it

367
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,560
the

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
microservice will obviously be done

369
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
within few minutes not even few minutes

370
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,000
i would say under one a minute at times

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
but with a fine like a big app like this

372
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
one which i was referring to 500k it may

373
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,959
take some time try to average out

374
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
something which takes

375
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
you know

376
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
10 to 15 minutes versus one minute what

377
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
is the average that you'll get are you

378
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
are we saying there that the average is

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
actually five to six minutes to run a

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
scan it's not fair to clog these

381
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,880
applications together um it doesn't

382
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
sometimes it could probably take a

383
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
little bit higher and then trying to

384
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
average them out doesn't help out here

385
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,839
so again presenting the data correctly

386
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
is actually important and you know this

387
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,959
actually

388
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
helps understand the context behind what

389
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
you're trying to showcase out here um as

390
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
you can figure out with examples uh

391
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
we discussed contextualization is very

392
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
important far too many achievements are

393
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
actually you know lost in translation

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,399
when you showcase uh

395
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,079
this in with the help of metrics

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,160
sometimes presenting the information

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
correctly is as important as getting the

398
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
information as well

399
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
using a pie chart instead of a bar

400
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,839
diagram

401
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
or to using the right colors while

402
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,839
presenting you know the right

403
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
information or presenting good or bad

404
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
outcomes is important

405
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
these are all important tools that you

406
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,839
you need to learn i mean you need to

407
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
pick up while presenting metrics to

408
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
leadership uh deciding when an overall

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,079
summary is better over granular data um

410
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,279
or

411
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
ultimately metrics carry your story they

412
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
are the story of how you have been

413
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
working to secure your organization um i

414
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
can share a lot more but i've spoken in

415
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
depth about this topic

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,000
at besides nova

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
the vulnerability tell you how to dig in

418
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
so you can just google it out if you

419
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,639
have to uh but at the same time our next

420
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,680
uh

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
talk in this room actually is being

422
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
given on metrics by christine she's over

423
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,600
here so if you still want to learn about

424
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
metrics stay over here

425
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
another critical factor for metrics is

426
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
accuracy

427
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
efforts should be made to get the most

428
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
accurate information while presenting

429
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,920
metrics

430
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
accuracy can only be possible if you

431
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
collect the data regularly and in the

432
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
correct manner as well

433
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
most teams don't face these challenges

434
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
in collecting data

435
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
it is only how frequently you can get

436
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
that spare team spalter out there

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
if it was collected manually you don't

438
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,759
want to do this daily but if it was

439
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
being collected automatically you can

440
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,199
obviously you know pull the data

441
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,160
regularly like almost on an hourly basis

442
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
if required

443
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,959
um

444
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
next thing is distribution itself um

445
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
what is the benefit of sending a weekly

446
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
report when you cannot show your success

447
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,000
on a weekly basis but the same success

448
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
can be shown on a monthly basis so think

449
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,519
about that

450
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,759
do does your vulnerability count

451
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
actually change on a weekly basis

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,079
i don't think so unless you are you know

453
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,279
sending

454
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,120
one code to production on a you know

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
weekly basis

456
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,519
on an average teams have a 15 day life

457
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
cycle where they have code changes

458
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,399
generally going either every 15 days or

459
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,199
every month over here it would make much

460
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
more sense to distribute your reports

461
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,600
monthly on a monthly basis or maybe

462
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
quarterly basis to actually show that

463
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
you have made improvement well compared

464
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,199
to the last report that we had that's

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
how you show improvement over here

466
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,599
so how do metrics deliver we spoke a lot

467
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
about metrics and how to show it but

468
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
who's actually watching this

469
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,559
your leadership

470
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
the ones the same leadership that who

471
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,959
asks you why should they invest in your

472
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,439
security program um why should they at

473
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
least keep you giving the same budget uh

474
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
if not more

475
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
okay so that's how metrics help you

476
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
metrics actually shows them that

477
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
security team is not a liability um the

478
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
the the work the team is doing is

479
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
actually helping the secure the

480
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
organization it helps shows the

481
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
intangible ways the organization is

482
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,760
saving on security incidents by actually

483
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
preventing them

484
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
it also highlights the progress made by

485
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
security teams to improve the overall

486
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
risk the organization currently has

487
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
and if you push your developers to

488
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
undergo secure code training on a

489
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,919
regular basis then you should show the

490
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
results over here in your metrics itself

491
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
that this investment helped reduce the

492
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
number of vulnerabilities over time um

493
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,160
in

494
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,039
in the organization itself

495
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
next one is technology

496
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
one of the main pillars for setting up

497
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,280
an appsec program is technology itself

498
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
this is where most of your money goes um

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
as a greenfield client and at least from

500
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
a consulting perspective when you say

501
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
greenfield it's like someone who does

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
not have any abstech program or has

503
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
maybe a little bit of it they're not

504
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
exactly they don't have a full-blown

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
abstract program over there uh in my

506
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
opinion you just start you should just

507
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
start with open source tools okay there

508
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
are several open source tools out there

509
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
um in the market in in general people

510
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,080
offer that uh so that you can at least

511
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,919
understand how things work

512
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
that is important before you go and jump

513
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
in and start buying tools from the

514
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
market you need to know what are you

515
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
buying what decision should you make

516
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
when when

517
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
running a poc what works for you what

518
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
doesn't work for you

519
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
um

520
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
like if you haven't heard of os

521
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
by now uh that is open web application

522
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,799
security program uh it's basically a

523
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
non-profit that has helped a lot in

524
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,400
appsec sector uh they have provided

525
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
tools trainings and the whole assessment

526
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
methodology over there um and it's one

527
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
of the driving forces at app say

528
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
the logos that you actually see right

529
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
now is just a sample of all the tools in

530
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
the market it is not the whole thing

531
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,080
it's not the whole picture out there um

532
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
maybe and then just start with a basic

533
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
scan run a sas scan when i say uh it

534
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
will a sas scan or a static application

535
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,320
security testing tool it helps identify

536
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
vulnerabilities in your application in

537
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,039
the code itself that you have developed

538
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,640
uh there are some decent open source

539
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,280
tools in the market for example uh

540
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,480
spotbox over there is very good for java

541
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
then you have breakmen for ruby on rails

542
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
uh there are some

543
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
then secure go for golang etc uh get a

544
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
sense on how these tools work and you

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,000
know how the results come out get

546
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
feedback from your developers in the

547
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,880
previous session that we had over here

548
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
they said he hates you i mean they hate

549
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,200
security team how many times have you

550
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
heard like security team is being a big

551
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
pain out here

552
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
try and collaborate with them try and

553
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
get feedback with them on how these

554
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,080
tools are affecting them and what would

555
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,120
they like try and get gain their

556
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
confidence in working with your tools

557
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,720
out there

558
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
um

559
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
you could also run a secret scanner does

560
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
anyone here know what is a secret

561
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
scanner the name itself will give you an

562
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,679
indication but does anyone here know

563
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,840
what's a secret

564
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,480
scanner you want to see

565
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
right so

566
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
just search for

567
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
you know passwords

568
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
how many times have you heard

569
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,679
development teams actually storing

570
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,760
passwords in the code itself i have

571
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,000
literally seen quite a few times here

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
in production

573
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
passwords tokens

574
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
ssn all of these i mean why is ssn over

575
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,159
there i have no idea but sometimes

576
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,240
people have stored this information in

577
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
their code repositories in fact one of

578
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,600
the

579
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
uh clients

580
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
from what i heard

581
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,919
their source code was public facing and

582
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,720
the saying passwords for all of their uh

583
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
servers but it wasn't that code out

584
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,320
there so somebody actually found it out

585
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
it was a major issue

586
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
ultimately you don't want that to happen

587
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
even with external you don't want this

588
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
to happen so

589
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,600
instead of talking to people about

590
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,080
trying to teach them about xss sql

591
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
injection let's go with basics

592
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
what is a password everyone knows what's

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
a password is it a good habit to store

594
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,240
passwords in code no it's not so just

595
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,080
run a secret scan and figure it out and

596
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,640
just try and close that out

597
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,520
um

598
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
then start introducing like just get

599
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
into this process of

600
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
identifying a vulnerability

601
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
understanding of vulnerability

602
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
and then fixing that one bitty let your

603
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,559
developers get used to certain security

604
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,400
initiatives you don't want to go big

605
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
bank theory on them you just want to go

606
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
one step at a time they're all babies we

607
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
need to treat them that way

608
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,000
then

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
introduce more tools that run different

610
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
kinds of assessments uh example sca or

611
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
dast now i'm going to say a lot of

612
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
acronyms i'm going to explain you what

613
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,679
are those acronyms as well

614
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
is rasp and all let's go with sca how

615
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,480
many of you have heard of log4j

616
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,200
everyone just about everyone okay so

617
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
from log4jd you heard the term called

618
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
sca

619
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,039
if not it's called source composition

620
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
analysis log4j came into picture because

621
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,919
just about every other application has

622
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
that as their logging capability it's a

623
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
free open source library which people

624
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,120
can include to start logging whatever

625
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,600
the application is doing out there

626
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
and an sca tool or a source composition

627
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
analysis tool actually identifies if

628
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,080
your application has that component or

629
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,799
not it is basically that

630
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,280
its job to find it out then the next job

631
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
is to after finding that component it

632
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
will tell you what are the publicly

633
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
known vulnerabilities in there

634
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
and guess what as for the latest report

635
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,240
that you know checks out you know how

636
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
people develop

637
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
eighty percent of anyone's code any

638
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,679
application at least eighty percent of

639
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,280
it is comprised of open source

640
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
components so you're actually

641
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
introducing risk from outside and not by

642
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
your own developers so running an sca

643
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
scan is actually important for your

644
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,840
organization

645
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,640
um we then have das scans or dynamic

646
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
application security testing

647
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
that's this basically running this a

648
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
scan on an endpoint give it a url run

649
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
the scan give it credentials so you can

650
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
run authenticated scans out there

651
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,200
some things cannot be found through sas

652
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
or sc it can only be found through dash

653
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
cams

654
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
so try running that

655
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
and then

656
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
i asked which is a a little bit more of

657
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,840
an intelligent way of running dash cams

658
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,200
that's what i would say

659
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
it's called interactive application

660
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,559
security testing so when you're actually

661
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
running a test or when you're running a

662
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
regression test out there by a human or

663
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,760
by an automated testing tool

664
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
i is will actually check it and see if

665
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,440
this response is vulnerable or not if

666
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,799
this is actually

667
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
going to lead to any vulnerabilities out

668
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
there so

669
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
and the other one is ras which works on

670
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
the server side similar thing but it has

671
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
a

672
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,400
capability to actually block um any

673
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
requests coming on production if it

674
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,320
thinks it's going to be malicious or not

675
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
note that is and rasp they don't have

676
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,960
any open source tools out there and the

677
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,600
market in general hasn't accepted it yet

678
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
so because it's very difficult to

679
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
understand difficulty

680
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
there's a lot of initial investment to

681
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,039
get things running to make use of these

682
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,440
tools and which is a hindrance for a lot

683
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
of people when you have to start working

684
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
with infrastructure teams to get things

685
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,760
installed

686
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,080
you are going to wait forever at least

687
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
for me

688
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,640
um then after you start running these

689
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,279
tools look at the issues look at

690
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,640
what's your

691
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
you know just uh

692
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
i would say what's your confidence level

693
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,720
in the tools and how how happy have you

694
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
been in just using these tools sometimes

695
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
you just hate how to use it maybe

696
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
there's a better tool in the market

697
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
which you know makes it simpler it lets

698
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
you connect everything it works pretty

699
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,440
well like you just have to do click

700
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
click click and it's done or it's like

701
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
you know give a few parameters at the

702
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
command line and it's done you can run

703
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
it automatically if you want to so think

704
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,240
in those factors if you had to scale up

705
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,679
if you had to improve the quality of the

706
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,240
issues look at tools in the market which

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,600
offer similar capabilities and then to

708
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,559
run a poc and then choose one

709
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,679
um

710
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
the you know the other aspect of running

711
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
assessments is that you don't need to

712
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,200
start scanning

713
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
you know all of your applications choose

714
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
the applications wisely you can go in

715
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
phases you start with the critical ones

716
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
which are important you need to make

717
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
sure they're secure out there and then

718
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,080
you go down to uh you know hi high

719
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
severity applications or rather high

720
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
criticality applications medium

721
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
criticality and so on so forth

722
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,679
just make sure you're settled with one

723
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,440
tool before moving on to the next

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,559
section out here

725
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
next is governance

726
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
somewhere in the beginning i wrote

727
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,880
without rules there would be an anarchy

728
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,120
i'm sure some people may disagree out

729
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,279
here i do not want to go into a whole

730
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,000
philosophical discussion about this um

731
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,799
but

732
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,640
coming back to this topic in order for a

733
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
security program to be effective uh

734
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
there needs to be some policies and

735
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,919
standards set to make sure that teams

736
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
just don't go and you know ballistic in

737
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,440
terms of developing and throwing things

738
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
in development how many of you have seen

739
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
cases where developers actually have

740
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
access to push things to production have

741
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
you seen in these cases yes i've seen

742
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
few hands here i personally saw this

743
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,520
happen like just recently and i'm still

744
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,240
shocked this happens yet people give

745
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,919
developers access to more code to

746
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,720
production um but you need to have some

747
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,200
rules you cannot just allow anyone any

748
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
uh you know to go and things deploy

749
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
things in production have you heard of

750
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
segregation of duties

751
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
this is a term that's coming up you one

752
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
person develops the other person tests

753
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,799
your third person deploys it in

754
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
production and a fourth person gives

755
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
approval for the same after reviewing

756
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,799
everything is being done correctly

757
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,080
um

758
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
similar way policies need to be

759
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,559
established what what is expected in

760
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,440
terms of security okay policies also

761
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
need to be scoped correctly and aligned

762
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,159
to the laws and regulations of the land

763
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
um you know some companies have to

764
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
comply with let's say pci standards some

765
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
companies have to comply with phi

766
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,159
standards policies help to make sure

767
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,200
that they're complying to the same

768
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,320
they then typical examples of a policy

769
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,480
could include all internet facing

770
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
applications have to go through a dash

771
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,200
can or a pen test at least and they have

772
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
to be done every one like every year

773
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
once a year at least

774
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
or all critical vulnerabilities have to

775
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,159
be closed out in let's say 60 days some

776
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,840
teams have actually seven days but i'm

777
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
just giving you you know a nice

778
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,799
standard out there uh 60 days of

779
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,919
discovery

780
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,919
and as an organization matures you can

781
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,559
actually go to you know reduce the same

782
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,399
timeline like i said seven days some

783
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,320
things actually can possibly do that if

784
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
they find a critical vulnerability they

785
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,919
just have seven days to fix that

786
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
vulnerabilities because they have a

787
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
process in place to go fix it deploy it

788
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
quickly test it out quickly and move it

789
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,039
to production

790
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
review your policies and standards every

791
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
two or three years you cannot keep the

792
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
same policy that was there for 10 years

793
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,320
back we need changes are happening

794
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
changes happen every year you need to

795
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
keep up with times the policies and

796
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
standards also need to keep up the times

797
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,880
and then metrics can be created to check

798
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,760
compliance to this policy

799
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,279
you can also set up some automated

800
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,679
notifications that tell you know teams

801
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,679
that you are actually going to violate

802
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,799
this policy in let's say x days or when

803
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,880
they have actually violated this policy

804
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
say that you violated this policy this

805
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,159
is the reason you need to go and check

806
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,720
it out here

807
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
okay this is going to be interesting how

808
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
long have you lasted

809
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,840
how long have you lasted before you

810
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
checked your phone i'm pretty sure some

811
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,919
i did during the calls i mean during the

812
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,440
sessions itself but how long have you

813
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,960
lasted

814
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,039
two minutes

815
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,559
four minutes

816
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,600
wow

817
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,879
anyone more than 10 minutes

818
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
wow okay there's someone over there wow

819
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,799
but no one okay

820
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
all right

821
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,279
all right after literally being thrown

822
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,080
you know into acquiring a digital life

823
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,640
we all of us and like i said at least i

824
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
have short attention span i am

825
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
at the mercy of my mobile phone see all

826
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,640
meetings all zoom meetings i have

827
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,480
definitely seen one it doesn't matter

828
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,840
it's like there's nothing important

829
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
coming in

830
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
there's nothing major coming in there's

831
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
no major emergency i'm not part of the

832
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,559
sock team i'm not part of the incident

833
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,080
response team where i should be getting

834
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
alerts out there if somebody's going to

835
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,039
attack me no

836
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,720
my biggest notification would probably

837
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,320
be an acute dog post coming up that's it

838
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,200
um

839
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,919
but

840
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,000
yes we have short attention span so

841
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
unless it is something really

842
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,559
interesting

843
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
and you know that i'm seeing and i'm

844
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,159
seeing good results coming out

845
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,240
i won't stick to that topic whatever is

846
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,679
happening out in front of me and

847
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,440
probably jump on to something else that

848
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,120
will you know give me instant

849
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,039
gratification you could say

850
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,440
same goes for leadership

851
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,679
they would rather want to see results

852
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
immediately or quickly at least

853
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,279
before they invest in the next big thing

854
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
especially when they're already

855
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
investing in something into heavy like a

856
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
security program security programs cost

857
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
a lot for them and they need to see

858
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,320
results

859
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,760
for that

860
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
and not just security it's just about

861
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
any program

862
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
but more for security because that's not

863
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
an roi this it's not a product which

864
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
will ultimately make millions for them

865
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
it is something that's just going to

866
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
take money it's not but and maybe make

867
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,840
sure that you're fine with it

868
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,880
um

869
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,240
so that's why our next topic comes in

870
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
quick wins

871
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,240
quick wins a quick win is an improvement

872
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,880
that is visible immediate benefit and

873
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
can be delivered quickly after the

874
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,200
project begins the quick win does not

875
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,519
have to be profound

876
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,159
and you know or have a long-term impact

877
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,559
to your organization but it needs to be

878
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,080
something that

879
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
stakeholders agree is a good thing

880
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,200
um examples or quick wins include

881
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,799
password protection just like we

882
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,360
discussed exclude any passwords or any

883
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,000
sensitive information from your code and

884
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
this is pretty easy to implement it's

885
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,919
very easy to find it's very easy to

886
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,320
implement just have a possible wallet or

887
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
a special place where people can just

888
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
pick up their passwords and connect it

889
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
to your application

890
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
um

891
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
another example is making sure

892
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
developers have to go through secure

893
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,960
code training how many of you have gone

894
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
through mandatory trainings as soon as

895
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
you have joined an organization pretty

896
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,039
much those who haven't gone through

897
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,039
you're lucky seriously

898
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,519
i've had to go through at least 90

899
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
trainings in one for one organization

900
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
which was horrible

901
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,559
but

902
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,200
anyways coming back to the topic secure

903
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
code training helps developers

904
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,600
understand how to write code securely as

905
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,840
simple as that it may not be an

906
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,640
immediate result like people will write

907
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,480
absolutely amazing code it won't stop

908
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
them going to you know stack overflow

909
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,799
and picking up copies of really bad code

910
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,880
and including it in their application

911
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
but at least it stops them from

912
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,279
you know straight away pasting anything

913
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,440
is this good code this is not what i was

914
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
taught maybe i have to validate input

915
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,279
something like that um making them go

916
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,600
through this training is

917
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
a quick win why because within 90 days

918
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,399
you can actually you know proudly say

919
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
your your developers actually are

920
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,039
trained in secure code

921
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,840
and then you can also drive out some uh

922
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
infrastructure changes

923
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,480
insecure conflict not everything has to

924
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
be tested like for 30 days

925
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
and then move to production some of

926
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,279
these changes just require a quick fix

927
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
and can be moved to you know within the

928
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,480
90 day cycle if you had to so it's

929
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,720
possible to you know get some in uh

930
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,200
insecure conflicts closed up

931
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
and then while you may have been running

932
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
scans manually at the beginning

933
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,519
automated scans

934
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,279
help a lot

935
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,200
can anyone say what's the

936
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,640
benefits of running an automated scan

937
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,918
yep go to other things

938
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,599
short attention span i can go and you

939
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,960
know switch on to another task

940
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,879
yeah

941
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,280
in short it actually helps efficiency

942
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,359
drives efficiency makes your developers

943
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,918
happy because you are not taking time

944
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,079
you are there is no delay as such in

945
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
terms of running these scans you can

946
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,879
scale up pretty fast i can give you uh

947
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,480
an example from

948
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,280
where i work um it took

949
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,199
us like within i was able to actually

950
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,760
run scans for 700 applications

951
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,839
with by setting up automated scans over

952
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,480
there within a month 700 applications

953
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
where i was able to onboard all of them

954
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
by after setting up automated i'm part

955
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,480
of desktop stream so i have to set up

956
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
these pipelines that run automated scans

957
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,800
um

958
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,280
okay any other improvement any other

959
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,000
example of quick wins

960
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
anyone

961
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
do you know any example of a quick win

962
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
that could help

963
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
say

964
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
security team is the best something on

965
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,160
that

966
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,560
all right

967
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,960
quick wins are a precursor to long-term

968
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
goals

969
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
it's something

970
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
okay anyways

971
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,119
okay

972
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,079
they are the initial set of results um

973
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,720
that offer you hope and vision into your

974
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,359
long-term results out there

975
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,200
it also builds trust for the security

976
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
team across the organization especially

977
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,760
the leadership team to know that the

978
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,079
security program is running well and it

979
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
can confidently take on other long-term

980
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
initiatives if they have to given the

981
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
right support you need that support from

982
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,720
leadership out there and everyone likes

983
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,119
success it shines attention on the team

984
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
that has actually done it and everyone

985
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,359
wants to be part of the success of that

986
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,280
success out there so the developer

987
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
community will actually want to be part

988
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
of the initiatives that you are taking

989
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
in because they've seen that you have

990
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
these wins coming up and like you're

991
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
getting all that attention out here

992
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
well that is just a summary of what you

993
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
can probably do to start an apsec

994
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,119
program um there's a lot more things

995
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,480
i've not covered up infrastructure

996
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
anything out here you may have seen i've

997
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,280
not

998
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,440
talked about cloud security or anything

999
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,960
because that's a whole big discussion

1000
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,760
out there but if you want to talk about

1001
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
it we can always talk here uh this was

1002
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
just a basic intro but feel free to

1003
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
connect with me on linkedin and if there

1004
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,880
are any questions i will take it out now

1005
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,980
thank

1006
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,130
[Applause]

1007
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,680
yes uh shift left that's a big

1008
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
uh keyword that's been running across

1009
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,760
and people sometimes think what is it

1010
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
all about and yes we have a lot of tools

1011
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,560
and you're right like how do we trust we

1012
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,079
don't trust them

1013
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,680
honestly i don't trust developers

1014
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,359
developers don't trust us

1015
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,079
um we but we do like to offer them tools

1016
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,119
saying

1017
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,680
use this try and find the basic of basic

1018
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,359
vulnerabilities out there

1019
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,760
the basic stuff do not include passwords

1020
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,079
or validate your inputs those tools

1021
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,839
actually try to find that out as well

1022
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,680
and they highlight it for them and it's

1023
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,920
actually way more easier to show them

1024
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
there itself while they're running the

1025
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,359
code then tell them three days later

1026
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,119
that this is there in your code out

1027
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,560
there um what we do is

1028
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
there are very few tools in the market

1029
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,240
that could actually offer that and it

1030
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
it's supposed to be the right fit a lot

1031
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
of the plugins that we call it id

1032
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
plug-ins that actually run scans on your

1033
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,359
code level while you're typing it can

1034
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,560
only work on eclipse and

1035
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
visual studio and that was some versions

1036
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
they are not equipped to run on let's

1037
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,880
say spring suit or any of the you know

1038
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,400
ids that gen

1039
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,880
developers generally use out there so

1040
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
the other offer is as soon as they come

1041
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
with your code it's very easy to do that

1042
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
you type you commit your code people do

1043
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
a lot of comments you can trigger scans

1044
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
over there it's called hooks that we

1045
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
call it and give you an offer where we

1046
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
check for specific vulnerabilities we

1047
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,160
don't check for everything we just check

1048
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
for specific vulnerabilities and like

1049
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,920
say this is what it but it's a slow

1050
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,320
introduction you cannot go straight away

1051
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,160
jump into it like if they have no

1052
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,040
exposure to any kind of security scan so

1053
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,280
if they are already used to finding

1054
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,440
vulnerabilities you're used to a tool

1055
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,160
after you you know push it to uh the

1056
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
master branch or whatever sorry the

1057
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
release branch

1058
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
then

1059
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
then you start introducing these tools

1060
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
if you have to

1061
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,040
okay

1062
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,839
any other questions

1063
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,240
how would you introduce api security

1064
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,599
that's a good question um

1065
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,280
i would start with simple training how

1066
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,280
to write apis in the first place

1067
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
so the question is how do you introduce

1068
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,880
security for people who develop apis is

1069
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,720
did i cover that correctly

1070
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,520
um

1071
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
start with basics how to write an api

1072
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,359
what what are the good practices

1073
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,040
sometimes people don't know what are the

1074
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,000
standard

1075
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
the you know development practices while

1076
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,720
writing an api let's say you know make

1077
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,359
sure it limits to certain values records

1078
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,640
are limited it's not showing the whole

1079
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,400
database out there when somebody queries

1080
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
just simple standard practices

1081
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
then uh there are certain tools that can

1082
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,119
only do api scans not all of the tools

1083
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,440
out there can do it use that look at

1084
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
ones which are focused on api scans and

1085
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,920
they're not like all the ballpark figure

1086
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,760
out there that's how you would probably

1087
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
introduce it

1088
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,720
any other questions

1089
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
going once going twice alright thank you

1090
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,839
everyone thank you
