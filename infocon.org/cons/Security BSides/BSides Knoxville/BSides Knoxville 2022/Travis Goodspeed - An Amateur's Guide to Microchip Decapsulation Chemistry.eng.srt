1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,760
all right and now we have

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
an amateur's guide to microchip

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
encapsulation chemistry with travis

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,130
goodspeed

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,219
[Music]

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
all right who likes

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,399
microchips

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
all right and if you really love

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
something you should boil it in acid

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
right

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,370
okay

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,559
[Applause]

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
this here

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
let's jump in a little bit closer

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
this is a complete 32-bit computer

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,719
including

17
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,600
ram

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
rom

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
it's connected to some other

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
ships on a board this is from a pcmcia

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,479
card

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,840
that stands for people can't memorize

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,080
corporate identification acronyms

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,479
um

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
for you youngins in the audience it used

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
to be that you'd buy a laptop and it

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,600
would weigh more than a brick and it

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,799
would not have wi-fi or ethernet and if

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
you wanted to get online you'd have to

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
install an extra card

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
this particular chip is from a

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
cryptography card

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,520
back then they didn't want you to have

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
cryptography and software

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,119
for fear that it would help the nazis or

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
something so

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
they

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
they made you buy it as a physical unit

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
and this was in a fortezza card which is

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,040
the replacement to the clipper chip

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,119
and it had a law enforcement access

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
field in it so you could

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
you could have cryptography but the cops

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
could undo it if they filed the right

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
paperwork

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
um

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
thankfully this standard died off in the

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,478
mid 90s and we don't use it anymore

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
so today i'm going to teach you how to

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
take a part a microchip and turn it into

51
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
bear glass like this and also how to

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
turn the bear glass into

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
a full photograph of the entire die

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,319
and how to do some other cool stuff like

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
if you zoom in close enough um

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
does anyone see this like

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
egyptian tablet like thingy right here

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,599
just to the

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,200
the right of my finger

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
if you zoom in really close on that

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
tablet

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
and you squint a little you can actually

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
see the ones and zeros of the boot rom

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
of this chip

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,400
and so when the chip is locked and

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
you're not allowed to read them you can

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
recover it photographically

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,519
and then from the photographs you can

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
get out like a file that you would load

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
into ida pro or gydra to reverse

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
engineer

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
another

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
thing that's pretty cool to do within

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
the the lab

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
this is one of my good fete boards i

76
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,640
designed these as an undergrad as like a

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
bus adapter but the cool thing about

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
this one is that little uh

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
circle that's burnt out of the side chip

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
this chip is an msp430f220

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
it's a 16-bit microcontroller that

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
contains the firmware to make it this

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,879
device

84
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,879
and by burning a hole in the outside i

85
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,519
can now shine lights into this chip

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
in order to mess with it as it's running

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,319
so

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
despite the whole burned in the

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
packaging of this chip this board is

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
still fully functional and still does

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
everything it's supposed to

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
this is a another msp430 chip which i've

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
live decapped the um the hole in this

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,599
package

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
allows the dye to be exposed so that i

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
can

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
shine a camera flash on it

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
and i'm not doing this to take pictures

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
i'm although

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
we do have cool pictures of it i'm

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
shining the camera flash because every

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
transistor on this microchip die is a

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
photo transistor and if you hit it with

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,599
light

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,439
it starts conducting electricity even

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
though maybe it's not supposed to

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
and if you hit the entire chip at once

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
with a very bright light

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
sometimes the readout protection on this

110
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,040
chip will fail and you will be allowed

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
to connect a debugger even though the

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
chip is locked and is not supposed to

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
allow its software to be read

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
and this is how you can get the firmware

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,479
out of a protected chip

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
you'll need some equipment to do this

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
this is my handy dandy hot plate

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
you'll note that the heat settings are

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
just in numbers from 0 to 10.

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
these very loosely correlate to

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
to real temperatures so you shouldn't

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
trust that it will keep the right

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,479
temperature at any given time

124
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
you need some beakers in order to hold

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
the acids these are pyrex glass

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
and they're great for everything except

127
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
for the hydrofluoric acid and the reason

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
for that is that the hydrofluoric acid

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
will eat the glass

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
and that winds up ruining your glassware

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
and your experiments

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
you'll need

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
pipettes so these little doohickeys

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
allow you to pick acid out of one jar

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
and put it into another

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,199
the big one on the left is what i use

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
for transferring

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
large amounts in the order of like 5 or

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
10 milliliters in order to entirely

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
drown a chip and then boil it on the hot

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,960
plate

142
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,759
the little one i use for stronger acids

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,400
in order to do the live decapping

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
and in that style i need a stronger acid

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
because the weak ones include water and

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
the water as a catalyst will burn off

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
the bonding wires that connect the chip

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
to the packaging

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
i've got these little squirt gun bottles

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
with acetone and water and isopropyl

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
alcohol this is not the type of ipa that

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
you drink

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
basically

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
we're using the acetone

155
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
to clean gunk off of the chip because

156
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,639
it's really good at dissolving stuff

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,400
we do this after the acid has broken it

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,759
apart

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,960
the ipa the isopropyl alcohol is not as

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
good as acetone at like picking up junk

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
but it's a lot easier to manufacture ipa

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,400
cleanly

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
so if i let acetone dry on the chip then

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
it will leave a residue behind

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
but if i use isopropyl alcohol in a

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,759
second bath for the chip then i can get

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,199
that residue off and have clean

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,759
photographs instead of dirty ones

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,840
you'll need a microscope

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
this is the cheap one that i keep in my

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199
lab i've had this one since grad school

172
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
it's um

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
you know there's a single column that

174
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,520
you look down it's metallurgical which

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
means that the light comes through the

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
lens to hit the surface

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
rather than

178
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
coming up through a glass slide like you

179
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
might have in high school biology class

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
and the reason for this is that the

181
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,639
silicon dioxide is opaque to light when

182
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
it becomes thick enough to be a chip

183
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
so if you try to shine a light through

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
it it gets blocked and you see nothing

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
we also need some chemicals this is um

186
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
65 nitric acid

187
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
this is the weaker nitric acid that i

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,080
use and

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
um it's nice for

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
destroying the packaging of the entire

191
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,520
chip

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
because the water inside of it will also

193
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,039
take off the bonding wires and that gets

194
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
me a very thin piece of glass that i can

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
photograph

196
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
i also got the good this is red

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
fuming nitric acid

198
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
instead of being 65 pure this stuff is

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
90 pure

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,919
uh it is at least 90 nitric acid and it

201
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
is at most 2 percent water

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
and that means that it will do very

203
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
little damage to the bonding wires and

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
this is how i'm able to remove the

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
packaging from a chip without damaging

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,160
you can use

208
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
regular nail polish remover as your

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,199
acetone

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,280
like i said this stuff is not completely

211
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
clean if you let it dry on a surface you

212
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
will then see gunk left over

213
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,759
but i don't care because i've got

214
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
isopropyl alcohol and for this stage the

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
99 reagent grade is a lot better as far

216
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
as cleaning stuff off giving you good

217
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
pictures

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,120
do not use this without a proper fume

219
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
hood but you can also use hydrofluoric

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
acid which is available

221
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,360
commercially as rust stain remover

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
to

223
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,959
remove layers of the microchip after you

224
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,399
have extracted the glass from the

225
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,760
package

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
um this is useful because as we burn

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
lower into the chip we have fewer things

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
on the surface blocking our view

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
on a smart card this is absolutely

230
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
essential because smart cards will have

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
like a maze of wiring on the surface

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,800
in order to detect your

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
messing around with them

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
and you have to remove all of those

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,519
wires in order to photograph any of the

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
organs of the chip like where the cpu is

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,240
or where the ram is where the rom is

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,480
and because the hydrofluoric acid

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
dissolves glass you have to use these

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
like plastic beakers in order to heat it

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
up to

242
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,519
knock the chip out

243
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,519
so we're now ready for our first

244
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,240
experiment um

245
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
we are going to use 65 nitric acid and

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
we are going to dissolve a chip

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
packaging in it in order to get the bare

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
glass and then we're going to photograph

249
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
the glass

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,920
so

251
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
this is the acid that we're using this

252
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
is the big two and a half liter jug

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
we're not going with the the stronger

254
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,000
stuff

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
these are our two chips

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
this is the ch-582m from a company

257
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
called wch

258
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
they're a chinese chip manufacturer

259
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
who has been making

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
lots of different microcontroller class

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
and radio class chips

262
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
over the past few years they're doing

263
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
many which are compatible with western

264
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,399
ships in order to be drop-in

265
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,000
replacements

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,079
so i bought the entire series and now

267
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,519
i'm photographing all of them in order

268
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
to see how they relate

269
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
um you begin with a beaker with the two

270
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
chips in it can anyone spot what's

271
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
dangerous in this photo

272
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
exactly the fingers and the gloves

273
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,920
so

274
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,640
you put the gloves on you open up the

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
nitric acid i use this little storage

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
bottle so that i don't have to bring the

277
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
the big jug around because if i spill

278
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
something out of that jug i can like

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
dissolve my oven

280
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
um

281
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
after dropping the acid onto the chips

282
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
and before any heat is applied

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
the uh the liquid will turn green and

284
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
you'll see this as like it looks like

285
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
ink coming off of the bottom of the chip

286
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
packaging

287
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,519
this is the ground pad and the pins of

288
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
the chip dissolving within the acid

289
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
um

290
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
green or blue will indicate metals like

291
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
copper um

292
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
a proper chemist could tell you more

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
about which means which and why

294
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
we then heat the packaging up

295
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
we're aiming at about 100 degrees

296
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,279
celsius

297
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
which is beneath the boiling point of

298
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,839
the acid but the hotter the acid is the

299
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,000
faster the reaction is and at room

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
temperature this acid is not strong

301
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
enough to dissolve the chip packaging

302
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,480
which is why we have to bump it up a bit

303
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
you are aiming for a temperature that is

304
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
high enough that the package will

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,079
dissolve but not so high that the acid

306
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,519
will boil off

307
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
and all of this is being performed

308
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
inside of a fume hood

309
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
with

310
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
forced air ventilation so all of the air

311
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,440
is being sucked out of the front of the

312
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
fume hood where i sit

313
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
and then pulled out through the top of

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800
the fume hood and then vented out of a

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
window in order to

316
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
keep my air clean

317
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
after a while

318
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
you'll start seeing the

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,680
the package fall apart

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,519
and the bare dye will be visible but it

321
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
will still be covered with a little bit

322
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
of gunk or residue left over from the

323
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
chip

324
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
here you can see

325
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
there's like a chip in the bottom right

326
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,360
and all those little specks all of that

327
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
used to be packaging on this chip

328
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,279
remember this was these were

329
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,240
two

330
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
packaged chips and some clear liquid

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
when we began now the liquid is green

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
and the packaging is crumbling apart

333
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,560
like a wet oreo

334
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
here are the two of them um this little

335
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
square here and that one up there

336
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
um

337
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,639
because they're still covered in gunk we

338
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,399
can't photograph them yet

339
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
so to fix that

340
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
we spray acetone over them in order to

341
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,680
uh knock off a bit of the surface gunk

342
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,800
and this leaves us with the um the two

343
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
bear dice at the bottom of a beaker of

344
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
acetone

345
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
which we put into an ultrasonic bath

346
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,519
this is a commercial jewelry cleaner

347
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,040
some other people who do this sort of

348
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
work they don't like to use the

349
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
ultrasonic bath

350
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,920
because the sharp edges of the chips

351
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
hitting against the side of the beaker

352
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
will sometimes chip or damage them

353
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
and you can see this damage in my dive

354
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
photographs

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
here's a close-up you can see the two

356
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,079
dice here

357
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,519
the gray one on the left is upside down

358
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,760
you will see a flat gray for the bottom

359
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,199
side of almost every chip

360
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
the front side is what has all of the

361
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,199
pretty colors and the fancy wiring in it

362
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,399
and that's usually covered in more

363
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,760
gunk than the back side is

364
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
as soon as you hit the button on your

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
ultrasonic cleaner

366
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,680
all of this black gunk

367
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
will start shaking around and very

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
quickly falling off of the chip and

369
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
dissolving within the acetone

370
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
so very quickly we have two clean dice

371
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,920
we then take these to the cheap

372
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
microscope this is the one in the lab

373
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
and we put it under the light and we

374
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
look at it and all we're looking to see

375
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
at this point is like how much gunk is

376
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
left on the dye

377
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
if i see a lot of it i'll dump it into

378
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,079
another acid bath

379
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,480
i might use a different acid such as

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,600
sulfuric acid depending upon the

381
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,199
epoxy chemistry of that individual

382
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,199
package

383
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
and then the end result is this clean

384
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,199
dye

385
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,160
floating in

386
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
sorry

387
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,160
this is floating in isopropyl alcohol

388
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
and remember isopropyl alcohol is good

389
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,880
because it is clean

390
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
i take it down to my photography

391
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
table this way

392
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
still in the beaker

393
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
and then as i remove it i have one

394
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
remaining problem which is that even

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
though the isopropyl alcohol is a lot

396
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
cleaner than the acetone it's still not

397
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
perfectly clean there is some

398
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
microscopic stuff dissolved in it

399
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
and if i allow it to dry on the surface

400
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
of my chip

401
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
then it's going to leave behind a little

402
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
residue that will show up in my

403
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
photographs

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,959
to fix that

405
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
i use computer air duster

406
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,639
and

407
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
with my tweezers i hold the dye in place

408
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,440
as i do a burst of air from the side

409
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,720
this causes all of the isopropyl alcohol

410
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
to fly off the side

411
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,519
taking its

412
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
dissolved stuff with it and that gives

413
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,440
me a clean dye that i can photograph

414
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,839
if this step

415
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
messes up or if i don't use clean

416
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
tweezers or

417
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,199
if like dirt from the surrounding area

418
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
or maybe a moth comes in and flies onto

419
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
it

420
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
i've not ruined everything i just have

421
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,279
less clear photographs

422
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
so many of these stages can be skipped

423
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,839
if you just need to quickly know answer

424
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,279
some small question

425
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
like does the chip have mask rom visible

426
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
from the surface

427
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,480
at this point i use a better microscope

428
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,759
this microscope is still a cheaper model

429
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,040
it's an m scope it's about yay tall

430
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,439
it has

431
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
two binoculars for my eyes and then it

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,279
has a third trinocular adapter for a

433
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,320
camera

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
this is a usbc camera that runs straight

435
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,199
to my desktop and i have a hot key

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
whenever i hit the power button on my

437
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
sun type 6 keyboard it snaps a

438
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,519
photograph and stores that as part of

439
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,839
the set

440
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
at low magnification sometimes you can

441
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,160
fit the entire chip within view

442
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,359
but

443
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,760
we want like crazy details we would

444
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,439
rather have

445
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,559
an image

446
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
of a size that we could blow up to fill

447
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,919
an entire wall

448
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
rather than of a size that

449
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
you know is napkin or book sized so the

450
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
way to do that is just to switch to the

451
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,119
higher magnification lens within the

452
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,400
microscope

453
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
and as we do that we have the problem

454
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
that

455
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,280
we only get to see one corner of the

456
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,760
chip and not everything is in focus over

457
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
here on the the far right side the focus

458
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
is off

459
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
so what we can do is we can move around

460
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,080
right if i move the microscope a little

461
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
bit to the right

462
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
i get another view and if i move it a

463
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
bit further i get a third view

464
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
jumping back to the far left here

465
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
we can start stacking these images

466
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
together right because these three are

467
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,400
the same chip just shown in different

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720
positions

469
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
so if we photograph the entire chip that

470
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
way we can overlap them in order to

471
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
create a single panorama with the entire

472
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
chip in view

473
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
doing this manually works fine for a

474
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
chip like this where i can fit the

475
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
entire width in only three photographs

476
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
but it is excruciating for larger chips

477
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,280
that require many different

478
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
many different steps so there's this

479
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
computer program called hug in

480
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000
huggin is a graphical user interface for

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
another package called pano tools

482
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
and

483
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
hug in has looked at all of the images

484
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,440
in my collection

485
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,240
and

486
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
all of these little points that you see

487
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
highlighted

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
are the same point between the left

489
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
image and the right image

490
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
even though the left image and the right

491
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
image are at different locations

492
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,520
and so huggin is able to identify all of

493
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,679
these overlapping points

494
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
and crunch the numbers together and then

495
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
throw out the ones that are false

496
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,320
positives or poor matches

497
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
and if it works out right it can then

498
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
take all of the different photos that

499
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,240
i've taken maybe 100 of them maybe 500

500
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
and it can stitch them into a single

501
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
composite image of very high resolution

502
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
where i can zoom in on any details that

503
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
i need or

504
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
or see any piece of the chip

505
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
conveniently

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
and you can recognize a few details of

507
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,880
this from the surface like

508
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,080
on the bottom

509
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
you see that some of those little

510
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
squares have a circle in them and some

511
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,720
of them don't

512
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
those are bonding pads and anything with

513
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
a circle on it has had a bonding wire

514
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
ripped off

515
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
anything without a circle never had a

516
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
connection

517
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,960
so

518
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
maybe if we touch a needle to one of

519
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
those we can access a special test mode

520
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,080
of the chip that was used during

521
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
manufacturing but never packaged

522
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
on this particular chip there was a

523
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,039
second die that would sit in the middle

524
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
and

525
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,720
this upper row on the bottom would

526
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
connect to that second die while the

527
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
bottom row would connect to the outside

528
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,720
of the physical packaging

529
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
so we might be able to tap the

530
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
communication between the two dice

531
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
within this package by touching needles

532
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
to one and not to the other

533
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,760
we also see those like

534
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,799
octagons in the the top right those are

535
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,400
inductors that tells us that this is a

536
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
radio chip and not a simple

537
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,520
microcontroller

538
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
but sometimes we need to see beneath the

539
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
surface

540
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,280
so the next experiment we're going to do

541
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,559
is um using rust stain remover this is

542
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
um like three percent hydrofluoric acid

543
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,400
um do any of you watch breaking bad do

544
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
you remember in the first season when uh

545
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
he kills the bad guy in his basement and

546
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,159
they have to get rid of the body

547
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,480
so he brings some chemical jugs home

548
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,960
from uh the high school that he works at

549
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,559
and dissolves the bodies on them that's

550
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,280
hydrofluoric acid it is not true that it

551
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
would dissolve the whole body but it

552
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
would dissolve the bathtub so they got

553
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
the math half right

554
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
um

555
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
because it dissolves glass

556
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
you need to use a plastic beaker for

557
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
this

558
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,559
um of a particular sort that can handle

559
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,960
the the temperatures and

560
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
um

561
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
the reason why we do this uh this is a

562
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
surface photograph of a chip from a

563
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,039
blood glucose sensor

564
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
if you're diabetic and you want to check

565
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,880
your insulin without having to stab your

566
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,679
finger

567
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
you can put one of these things on your

568
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
shoulder and then you can tap it with

569
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,080
your phone and your phone will ask this

570
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,880
chip what your blood glucose is um it's

571
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
a medical god send especially um you

572
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,280
know for stubborn patients who don't

573
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,200
want to deal with finger pricking

574
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,320
um

575
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
but if you look at the surface of it

576
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,640
you see that it's like kind of faint and

577
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
blurry and if you zoom all the way in

578
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
you can see that there's this pattern of

579
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,799
like

580
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,080
little

581
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
metal dots

582
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,799
and this pattern is a fill layer in

583
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
order to have

584
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
you know fewer gaps on the surface

585
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
smart cards will go a step further and

586
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
all of this metal will be connected into

587
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
a crazy maze

588
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,919
so that the maze can't be broken while

589
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,520
keeping the chip functional

590
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
for photography we've already broken the

591
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
chip we've already removed all of the

592
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,320
bonding wires but we want to know what's

593
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
beneath the surface

594
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
so this is the chip at the top

595
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
and if we boil it in hydrofluoric acid

596
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520
for like five minutes

597
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
we can remove that top layer and begin

598
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
to see more organs of the chip we can

599
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
now see where the rom is we can see

600
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,280
where the s-ram is

601
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
this chip has a crazy

602
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
non-volatile memory called fram and we

603
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
can also identify that visually

604
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,440
and you can see

605
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
uh pieces of it like if i flip between

606
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,919
them

607
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,000
some of these large areas are completely

608
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
invisible from the surface some of these

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
big rectangles

610
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,559
and then

611
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,320
as i jump down they become visible and

612
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
if i go just a bit further

613
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
they become really well separated and i

614
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,919
can now see that like the the cpu is

615
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,080
probably that t on the right

616
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
and that the um the memories are in

617
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,440
different locations and this lets me

618
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
understand more about the chip that i'm

619
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
working with

620
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,640
at the extreme end of this is reverse

621
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
engineering the um

622
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
uh the gate structure of the chip uh

623
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,679
which i've not done firsthand but which

624
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,159
you can find in literature for um

625
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
like the the myfair classic had its

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
cryptography reverse engineered this is

627
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
a

628
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
an nxp

629
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
rfid tag used for building access

630
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,760
uh

631
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,799
karsten knoll and starbug and uh henrik

632
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,320
platz and a few other fine people they

633
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
they took these de-layered photographs

634
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
of that rfid tag and they were able to

635
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,159
reverse engineer the

636
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,159
proprietary cryptographic algorithm used

637
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,279
by the tag

638
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
in order to recover the keys of all of

639
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
the tags and break that

640
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,918
system

641
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,679
so this is great if you're trying to

642
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
photograph a dead thing if you're trying

643
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,400
to see what

644
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
what used to be there and then get rid

645
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,279
of it

646
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,039
our final experiment for today is going

647
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
to involve the stronger acid this is red

648
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
fuming nitric acid this is at least 90

649
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,799
percent

650
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,120
nitric acid this is at most 2 percent

651
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
water

652
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
when you open this bottle there is like

653
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,000
a mist of uh acid fumes that come out of

654
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,960
it

655
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
um

656
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,159
this is the one that you really want the

657
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
gloves on for and use

658
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
latex gloves do not use nitrile gloves

659
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
not the blue ones the blue ones will

660
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
catch on fire if you put three drops of

661
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,760
this stuff on them

662
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
this is our friendly neighborhood

663
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
fortesa card

664
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,200
trademarked by the nsa i think

665
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
in the mid 90s you would use this for

666
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,799
secure telephones you would have a

667
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,880
pcmcia slot on the side of the phone you

668
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
would insert your card you would know

669
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,559
your pin number and this would allow you

670
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,440
to make secret phone calls

671
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,120
you could also plug it into your laptop

672
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
and your laptop could use it to send

673
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,279
secret emails

674
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
all of these cards have long died they

675
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,159
depended upon a battery that would back

676
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,960
up ram in order to hold the keys so as

677
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
the batteries died all of the keys died

678
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
with them

679
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,919
a fellow who also does chip photography

680
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,360
by the name of john mcmaster just sent

681
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
me a giant box of them and i'm going to

682
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
see if i can get the code out or or

683
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,640
something fun with them

684
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
but for today we're going to use this as

685
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,880
our target example

686
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,559
so this is the pcmc card with the

687
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,120
metal packaging removed you can see the

688
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,799
the card slot on the right which is what

689
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,279
we connect to the laptop motherboard

690
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
and this big

691
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,520
microtronics chip the myk-82 by vlsi

692
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,799
semiconductor

693
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,880
this is the secret sauce chip

694
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,760
and you can see there's an arm logo in

695
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
the corner of the chip that's how we

696
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,320
know that this contains a cpu

697
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
in order to live decap this we first

698
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,039
heat it up on the hot plate

699
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
and then

700
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,320
we take some of the red fuming nitric

701
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
acid and we move it to a beaker using

702
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,880
the the large pipet

703
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,320
this is the last time that i will use

704
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
the large pipette because the small

705
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
pipette with a very teeny tip allows me

706
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,039
to put very little acid onto my target

707
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,480
when i first started doing this i would

708
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
use a metal mask

709
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,400
using um like metal duct tape

710
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
i stopped doing that because i

711
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
found that it was easier to just put a

712
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
very little amount of acid in the center

713
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
of the chip patiently wait for it to

714
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,799
drill down and then wash it off with

715
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,159
acetone

716
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
so we take just the tiniest bit out you

717
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
can see the the yellow in the pipette is

718
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
very very little

719
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
and then i put just a single smallest

720
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,240
possible drop and this drop has to come

721
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
directly from the tip like you would use

722
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
in a fountain pen this can't be a drop

723
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,559
that builds up and then falls off of the

724
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
tip because that will be too much acid

725
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,600
um i let it sit there and sort of bubble

726
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
away for just a second

727
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
and then i move the board over to a

728
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,240
large beaker and i squirt acetone out of

729
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,200
my squirt gun bottle at it

730
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,159
and

731
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,840
you can see the the acetone sort of

732
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,919
running down the side of it um the

733
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
boiling point of acetone is very low

734
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,200
so

735
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
as i squirt the stuff out

736
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
the board still dries off very quickly

737
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,960
and i'm not leaving behind any residue

738
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,279
you can see that the there's this little

739
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
circle in the center

740
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
and that the vlsi logo is damaged um

741
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,880
this acid has torn away that small bit

742
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
of the packaging of the chip while

743
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
leaving everything else intact all of

744
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
the other pins are intact there is no

745
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,760
rust elsewhere on the board there is no

746
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
damage

747
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,960
i keep repeating this i keep

748
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
putting just the tiniest bit in to fill

749
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,320
that cavity that i'm drilling down

750
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,159
under heat i wait for that cavity to

751
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,360
expand

752
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,000
and then i put more onto it and with

753
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,080
each step the circle grows a little bit

754
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,960
wider

755
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,600
and a little bit deeper um

756
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,159
and eventually we start seeing stuff

757
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
inside

758
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,200
this piece here is actually a copper

759
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
ground plane

760
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
i don't know whether it's a security

761
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,200
feature or whether it's a coincidence

762
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
but the dye in this chip is actually

763
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
stored upside down

764
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,360
this does become a good demonstration

765
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,640
though for why

766
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
the copper metal on the top of the chip

767
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
is not damaged by

768
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,799
the red female nitric acid

769
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
in this photo i've only used red fuming

770
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,120
nitric

771
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
if i then put a little drop of the 65

772
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,279
nitric

773
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,760
it starts changing color becoming less

774
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,720
shiny

775
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
and if i leave that drop there

776
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,679
it boils in this green color which as i

777
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
told you before indicates that metal is

778
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,080
breaking apart and then forming

779
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,799
compounds with the acid and if i go far

780
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,880
enough through this using red nitric

781
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
again

782
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,600
this little

783
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,559
glass here is the

784
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,960
back side of the microchip

785
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,159
which has none of the interesting

786
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,880
details but we'll do things like

787
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
allow infrared light to leak out

788
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,120
so you can run the chip

789
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,640
in a dark room

790
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,720
under a microscope and then

791
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,120
record the the session in infrared light

792
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
in order to see

793
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
which pieces are lighting up a fellow by

794
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,600
the name of dimitri no nasal

795
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,799
does some experiments with that

796
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,279
i can then repeat this on the

797
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,840
sram chip u4 down in this corner in

798
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,159
order to expose it

799
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,399
but what i really want is the top

800
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,279
of the vlsi chip

801
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
to see that that same picture in the

802
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
glass so i turn it upside down

803
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,559
you can see here that the

804
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,960
secret government chip was made in

805
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
taiwan

806
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,039
and then i repeat the the same

807
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,679
experiment i put a tiny amount of acid

808
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,000
in the middle of it i allow that to

809
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,799
boil up i wash it off with acetone

810
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,960
this forms like a little cavity and then

811
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,279
as i repeat this eventually the dye is

812
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,760
exposed

813
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,919
and now i've got the functioning

814
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,840
microchip visible from the surface

815
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,679
without damaging any of the bonding

816
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,760
wires or breaking the chip or its

817
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,480
functionality

818
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,679
these experiments are

819
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,159
not so useful on their own or without

820
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,080
combining it with something else

821
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
so

822
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,279
you might want photographs of a chip in

823
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,399
order to know what model number it is

824
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,000
many times when you're taking something

825
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,039
apart you'll find a black epoxy blob on

826
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,279
the board with no package that has a

827
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,720
part number but you still need to know

828
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,159
what's inside

829
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
and this sort of chemistry can answer

830
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
that question for you

831
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,519
you can also

832
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,679
you also sometimes find a

833
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,760
chip that is locked and you're not

834
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
allowed to read the firmware out of it

835
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,399
by removing the lid of the package and

836
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
shining a light in either a laser at

837
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,519
some particular area or by hitting a

838
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,600
camera flash the entire thing

839
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
you can confuse the flip-flops that

840
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
record the state of whether or not

841
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
you're allowed to

842
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,919
read the memory out of the chip

843
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,880
and by knocking them loose you can then

844
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,640
freely read the firmware out and get a

845
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
copy of like the firmware to protected

846
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,679
medical equipment

847
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,480
you can stick needles into the chip they

848
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
make these micro positioner probes that

849
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,600
have

850
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,679
like an etched tungsten needle coming

851
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,440
off the edge of them and they have

852
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
little knobs that you turn in order to

853
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
move that needle around the chip and

854
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
touch a particular area and then they

855
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,279
have an amplifier so that you can

856
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,720
see that signal on your oscilloscope

857
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
even though that signal never was

858
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
supposed to have been brought out of the

859
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,640
chip

860
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
if you can touch an address or a data

861
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
line this way you can then leak memory

862
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,440
out of the chip or sort of watch as it's

863
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
doing its thinking

864
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,919
um

865
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,240
and uh it's a hell of a lot of fun to be

866
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
able to do this

867
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,080
um i got out of this hobby for 10 years

868
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,760
and i recently got back into it i

869
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
converted my upstairs kitchen

870
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,360
uh all of the

871
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,559
all of the photos that you've seen today

872
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
and all of the uh techniques

873
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,360
are from my home lab

874
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
so

875
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,519
um

876
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,039
and this is nacho

877
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,039
he's nacho cat

878
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,600
um thank you for your time and attention

879
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
and if you have any questions um

880
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,279
i'd like to hear them and i've also got

881
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,399
a couple of books to give away of um

882
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,080
pocket gtfo from no starts press yes

883
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,039
oh

884
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,720
um

885
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
so so the question was how did i

886
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,880
discover all of this um

887
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,080
very little of this is entirely new work

888
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,279
um most of this i've learned from books

889
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,000
or from discussions with other people

890
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,919
chris tarnowski and brookhill helped me

891
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,600
out when i was getting started

892
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
and john mcmaster helped me get back

893
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
into this hobby after

894
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,559
i left it and

895
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,039
all of my tools in storage

896
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
the

897
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,799
the proper technical name for this in

898
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
forward engineering as opposed to

899
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,840
reverse engineering

900
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
it's called failure analysis

901
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,519
and you can find books on failure

902
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,519
analysis chemistry

903
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,639
that walk you through all of these

904
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,079
procedures but they sort of assume that

905
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,839
you're going to have a very well-funded

906
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
lab to do it in

907
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
and so they don't answer such questions

908
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,359
as like what's the best equipment to

909
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,079
purchase by ebay or which chemicals can

910
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,960
i get at the home depot

911
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,399
questions which are important if you're

912
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,960
trying to do this at home

913
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,480
so yes

914
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
why can't you use a plastic or sorry a

915
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,359
metal applique instead of the plastic

916
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
pipette to gently

917
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
apply the

918
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
higher strength acid to d-cap

919
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,560
so

920
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,119
it's not that the acid has no reaction

921
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
against the metal

922
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,760
it's the the reaction becomes buffered

923
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,918
by the initial reaction sort of like

924
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,000
stainless steel and atmosphere um the

925
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
surface of stainless steel is a very

926
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
fine layer of rust

927
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,200
um which is why like and same for um

928
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,440
aluminum so if you put gallium or

929
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,760
mercury on top of aluminum you can rust

930
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
it all to hell

931
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,879
similarly the

932
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,520
the pipette the plastic one has no

933
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
reaction against the acid

934
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,079
i can leave a pipet sitting in the acid

935
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,000
for a week come back and none of it has

936
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,200
been damaged

937
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,920
for metal it buffers enough that i'm not

938
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,839
going to damage the wires during any

939
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
individual reaction but if i were to

940
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,760
like forget that i had the acid there

941
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
and i would leave it then eventually the

942
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
water from the atmosphere would be

943
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,640
enough of a catalyst to melt a metal

944
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
pipette

945
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,200
yes so so for light

946
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,640
camera flash

947
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,839
everything just booms uh but with a

948
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,280
laser how how accurate can you get

949
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
uh as in can you touch

950
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
a single transistor or

951
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is it right so the

952
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,160
and again the signal transistor thing is

953
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
something that i've read about but not

954
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,760
done firsthand um

955
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,520
in cmos you basically have one

956
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
transistor that is pulling the voltage

957
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
high and another that pulls it low and

958
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
you balance all of these so that they

959
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,760
don't conflict with each other

960
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,000
the easiest thing that you can do with a

961
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
laser focus through a microscope is you

962
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
can hit the transistor that is supposed

963
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,480
to not be conducting

964
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
and then it will conduct a little bit

965
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,720
and you will be wasting electricity

966
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,960
between high and low voltage

967
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,800
there's a fellow by the name of sergey

968
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,839
so i hope that i'm pronouncing that

969
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,960
right

970
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,520
he did a dissertation on um

971
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
on these sort of like semi-invasive

972
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,200
photovoltaic attacks where you have

973
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,599
opened up the packaging invasively but

974
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,839
you are um

975
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,200
you're not sticking any needles in

976
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
you're only shining light in

977
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
as for light against the whole package

978
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,839
you are damaging or you are damaging the

979
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
state of like half the flip-flops

980
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,079
s-ram will sometimes go wonky

981
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,200
um

982
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,440
you have to arrange it so that when

983
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
everything gets scrambled

984
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
the piece that you wanted to

985
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,119
hit also flips over and then you can

986
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,320
correct everything else so in in my case

987
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,920
for using that technique against an

988
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,240
msp430 that allowed me to connect to

989
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
debugger and then through the debugger i

990
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,359
was able to like reset all of the values

991
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,640
that i needed for the flash memory to

992
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
work and all of the other configurations

993
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,118
that i owe

994
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760
cool

995
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
um

996
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,880
yes any other questions uh yes yes

997
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,720
is there any that this won't work

998
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
on or will it work on most of them so

999
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
the question was is there any chip that

1000
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,880
this won't work on um

1001
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,680
there are chips that i've read about

1002
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,720
which

1003
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
will include like

1004
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,359
a mems function like an accelerometer

1005
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
and then if the mems

1006
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
you know micro electron

1007
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
micro electrical mechanical systems

1008
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
they're really tiny and fragile

1009
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
and the acids that i'm using might

1010
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,640
damage that as i'm taking the chip apart

1011
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,880
so you can use that as a sort of sensor

1012
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,839
you can also include um

1013
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,000
like a photo transistor

1014
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,680
in order to intentionally recognize the

1015
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
background light

1016
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,760
i've read about these being in smart

1017
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,359
cards but most of my practical

1018
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,440
experience has been with consumer

1019
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
microcontrollers which do not include

1020
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,960
these features because they would

1021
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
decrease the reliability

1022
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,880
and increase the cost of the chip

1023
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,640
without providing any advantage to the

1024
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
manufacturer

1025
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
so defenses against this are possible

1026
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
but they're rare

1027
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,440
even

1028
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,800
the

1029
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,680
microtronics chip that i showed

1030
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,480
you know

1031
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
it has the die upside down but it has

1032
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
nothing else that i've found that tries

1033
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,359
to make it hard to take apart

1034
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,320
so

1035
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,060
yes

1036
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,239
[Music]

1037
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,599
excellent question

1038
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,960
no i'm a bit lazy about that i i use um

1039
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
i boil it off where i use baking soda

1040
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
what was the question oh the question

1041
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
was do i use any bases to react against

1042
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
the acid in order to make it neutral

1043
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,079
before

1044
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,720
disposing of it

1045
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
for a spill i drown and drown the finger

1046
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
in soap and i cuss like a sailor

1047
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
um

1048
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,240
it is important to know the difference

1049
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,640
the 65 nitric

1050
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,920
it's like um it numbs your nerves before

1051
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,760
it starts melting your flesh

1052
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
so if you spill some of it it's like a

1053
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,119
little tingly feeling but it doesn't

1054
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
actually hurt until the next day when a

1055
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,839
big chunk of your finger is gone

1056
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,440
and when you start using latex gloves

1057
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
with it you'll notice that they turn

1058
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
yellow

1059
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
which is all of the acid that you would

1060
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,079
have gotten on your fingers if you

1061
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,640
hadn't used the gloves

1062
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,359
and that's why it's important to use

1063
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,560
these safety

1064
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,240
things ritualistically

1065
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
rather than only when you expect that

1066
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,760
you're doing something dumb as um

1067
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
it's the the hold my beer principle of

1068
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,000
safety

1069
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
so how how do you want to give away

1070
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
these books all right ask some questions

1071
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
you want to do some challenges or um so

1072
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
so those are for a different thing oh

1073
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
these are for different these are for

1074
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
the uh the lock picking challenge okay

1075
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,200
um the kid in the black hills shirt if

1076
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,839
you could pass this back to him

1077
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,440
and um

1078
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,280
i've got volumes two and three who would

1079
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
like each

1080
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,640
yes

1081
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,119
and one more all right if you could pass

1082
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,359
that to him so that i don't uh

1083
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,000
gentlemen in the besides maroon b-sides

1084
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,599
t-shirt

1085
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,680
which b-sides is that

1086
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,800
tampa i like it i like the pirate theme

1087
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
cool

1088
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
and that's the end of my show thank you

1089
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,740
for your time and attention

1090
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,439
[Applause]
