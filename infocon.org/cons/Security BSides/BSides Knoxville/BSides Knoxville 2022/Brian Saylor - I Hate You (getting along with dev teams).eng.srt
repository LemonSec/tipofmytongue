1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
so no there i was

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
it was barely the crack of dawn

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,640
like

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
like not even 10 30 in the morning yet

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
it was the the the smell of burned

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
coffee was still wafting down the halls

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,560
from the break room

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
developers were getting out of the scrum

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,719
meeting calls in the morning

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,840
and it was right about then when it

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
happened

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,399
the food network website was

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,440
down now the

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
we manage quite a few other websites and

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
this was like our largest

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
like 100 million unique users hundreds

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
of millions of page views

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
so this site being down was a big deal

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
so immediately grabbed some a couple of

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,640
engineers threw them on looking at what

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
was going on

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
now right away it was apparent the site

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
itself wasn't actually down that was a

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,880
bit of an exaggeration

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
no it was recipe pages

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
well this is almost worse because if

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,400
you're going to food network you're

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
typically going to look at recipes

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,080
and food networks uh you know website is

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
ad driven

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,439
and

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,240
all of the uh

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,759
most is all ad driven

34
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,479
so if we don't have people coming we

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
don't have seeing some of the pages

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
then

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
we're not making any money

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,360
and all of those ad impressions are all

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,159
pre-sold and if we don't

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,280
turn out the

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,759
the expected number of pages then

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,600
somebody's got to get a refund

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,719
and i don't want that coming out of my

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,199
paycheck

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,439
so we're doing some digging into that

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,719
trying to find out what's going on and

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,240
the pages themselves are not actually

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
down it's really only part of it

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
and the pages are sort of corrupted

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
all right let me tell you a little bit

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
about myself first

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,520
so i'm brian saylor i'm uh

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
i've spent

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
a lot of years working in the

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
software development field so i've

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
worked at some

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
startup companies i've worked at the

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
government

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
and

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,280
about 18 years back i kind of fell into

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,640
working with media business

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
so i started out working with ew scripts

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
down here in knoxville

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
eventually moved over to scripps

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,959
networks

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,920
then to discovery

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,239
so i hope everybody is familiar with all

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
the discovery brands of sites and

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
channels

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
and of course as of a few weeks ago

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
warner brothers discovery

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
so now that the list of

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
websites and applications and mobile

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,159
apps and things like that that i'm

75
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
working with are going to grow up

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,360
uh exponentially again

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,519
working with these typically i'm working

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
more with

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
i've been doing the

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
leading software development i've been

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
the software development manager

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
i've been overseeing multiple teams of

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
software developers

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,040
mostly i work with automation now

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
but who cares that's just me

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
so let's get back to our story

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
so we're looking at recipe pages why the

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
recipe page is messed up

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
so not all the recipe pages are messed

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,319
up is maybe one in ten

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
and we start digging into those

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
and it comes clear after a little bit

93
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
that it's the

94
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,239
comments and ratings pieces

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,040
um the modules of all these websites are

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,319
all modular right and they've got

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,439
different services feeding different

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
parts of them and the commons and rating

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,080
systems is not just missing it's sort of

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,879
it's messed up the things are all broken

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,879
uh which just makes for a bad experience

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
so we call the

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
community team who manages all of that

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,000
right all of our things are split up

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
we've got teams handling search teams

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
handling the community pieces we've got

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
team handling

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,239
content delivery

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
community team looks into their things

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
and

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
nothing's wrong

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
so there's no errors on our side we've

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
got

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
our system's not sending any any bag

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,759
problems nothing's nothing in the

116
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
monitors have tripped anything no alerts

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
it's not on our side it must be on your

118
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,080
side

119
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
so our engineers are still digging into

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
this what's going on

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,520
so we start taking the actual requests

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
that are coming in

123
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
the server to server requests that are

124
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
coming back with those

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
individual things and this time by this

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
time it's now 20 of the recipes

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,120
right it's getting worse

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
so if you pull out one of those those

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
calls

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
right there's error handling for things

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
like response code is that

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,199
we're clearly getting 200 response codes

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
because that would be a trap and it was

134
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,080
there's special handling for that kind

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
of stuff it's not timing out again that

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
would get trapped and we have special

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
ways of handling that kind of stuff the

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
comments are just like not going to show

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
up

140
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
no what we find is what we're getting

141
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
back from this system that returns json

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,759
this json endpoint is an html page

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
which then tells us that hey this site

144
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
may not be safe it's not categorized are

145
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
you sure you want to proceed

146
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
where is this coming from

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
right this is this is this is between

148
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
two of our internal company services and

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
yet there's an html page it doesn't come

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
from their system doesn't come from our

151
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
system

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
where is it coming from

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,919
well as probably some of you have

154
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
figured this is some sort of this is a

155
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
security system intended

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
for

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,600
employees and checking the sites that

158
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,039
they're going to and checking if they're

159
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
in the in category categories that are

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
okay

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,199
but in this particular case it was

162
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,000
triggering on internal

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
um

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
service calls you know that are they're

165
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,120
all internal to the

166
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
to the company

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
so

168
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
we didn't work with the security team we

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
got it straightened out eventually

170
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,759
um

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,039
and then had to flush all the rescue

172
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,639
pages again because we were caching the

173
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
bad responses

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
but you can imagine

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
these developers had now spent a number

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
of hours

177
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
tracking down a problem

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
that wasn't part of any of their systems

179
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,799
no one knew where it had come from

180
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
eventually we got back to it but the you

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
know we we're we track like per minute

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
like when when sites are down and when

183
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
we're not able to deliver our content to

184
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
our customers in this particular case

185
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
something went wrong okay not the end of

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
the world we dealt with it

187
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,840
but it was annoying

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
so let's talk about another story

189
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,479
so one day

190
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,319
i'm working with

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
i'm just doing my regular stuff working

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,759
on my computer doing email

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,400
and my system my computer starts getting

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
really slow

195
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,160
eventually start digging into it there's

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
a process running and it's it's camping

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,560
on one of the cpus burning 100 of the

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
cpus on my mac

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
huge amount of memory

200
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,520
uh fine i don't know what it is

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
i kill it

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
great everything's good again for about

203
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,479
30 minutes

204
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
process spawns back up again

205
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,560
camps on the cpus everything's slow

206
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
kill it again of course it comes right

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
back

208
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
start asking starting around the the

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
development in engineering groups a

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
couple of people reporting the same

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
thing but only a few

212
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
by the next day

213
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,639
everybody was having the problem

214
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
everybody's computer was suddenly super

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
slow

216
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,958
um

217
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,519
so like so take uh design

218
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
are ux designers right they're running

219
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
photoshop and they're creating mock-ups

220
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
of pages that are going to get

221
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
implemented by development teams they're

222
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
creating

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
image assets

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
and photoshop is suddenly taking

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
super long to do anything right so

226
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,600
things that would normally take them 30

227
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
minutes are taking them an hour and a

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
half or two hours to get done

229
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,880
engineering and quality assurance

230
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
they're all being impacted

231
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
now a few people

232
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
are on windows machines and they're not

233
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,839
having a problem

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,360
but most of the team is all on

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
macintosh's and and they're all being

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,519
impacted

237
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
so what was going on because we couldn't

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
get rid of the software in fact we did

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
track down what the software was and we

240
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,599
uninstalled it

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
and 24 hours later it reinstalls

242
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
so this was this was security software

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,959
that was you know so we you know i

244
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,760
reached out to our desktop support team

245
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
walked through this problem with them

246
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
and they confirmed yes this is this is

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
security software that's intended to

248
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,120
check for

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
somebody's computer getting compromised

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
and to notify them that you know

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
something's wrong

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
but why why is it sitting there and

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
chewing up

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
the you know all the cpu resources and

255
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
all the memory

256
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
start working with a security team

257
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
they reach out to the vendor

258
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
uh the vendor promises a fix

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,360
so eventually you know so we there's

260
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
gonna be a fix it's gonna be in the next

261
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
friday that's gonna roll out this has

262
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
now been a problem for two weeks

263
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
friday rolls out the fix rolls out and

264
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
it doesn't make any difference

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,360
now another thing we noticed while this

266
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
was going on is that

267
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,480
the it's right into the disk

268
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
and it's riding several terabytes a day

269
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
and these are all ssd drives

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
on these macs right so they've got like

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
a lifespan maybe of seven years of

272
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,079
normal usage

273
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
but you suddenly start writing terabytes

274
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,279
of data day after day after day

275
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
you know suddenly that may kick you know

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
die after a year or two who's gonna pay

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
for the replacement

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,839
um you know we missed our uh you

279
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,440
know the development teams missed their

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
their deadlines right because everything

281
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
is taking so much longer right or

282
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
they're putting in extra hours

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,360
to try to finish things

284
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
still no word you know on on how we're

285
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
going to fix this eventually again

286
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
continuing to work with our desktop

287
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,399
support team

288
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
they eventually walk through exactly

289
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,399
how to disable the software

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
not uninstall it but just have it not

291
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
run

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
because if you uninstall it right this

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
the software management software will

294
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
reinstall it

295
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
yeah

296
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
so we worked around it

297
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,279
we went through we provided those

298
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,959
instructions to everybody

299
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,920
and they

300
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
they got it off their machines

301
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
now there was probably a really good

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
reason to have that software doing what

303
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
it was going to be doing

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
but it was certainly not working and it

305
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
was a huge inconvenience and it was

306
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,399
certainly

307
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,240
making everything difficult to do

308
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
here's another another item so we have a

309
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,599
design team who's building prototypes

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,279
um

311
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
so they're building sort of an

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
interactive prototype for some you know

313
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
new

314
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
uh update to one of our products

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
and they're about to be

316
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
presenting it to the vice president

317
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
they've been

318
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,639
working on this for a while this is a

319
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,839
little um

320
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
it's it's still static pages but they're

321
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
but the links on the pages work so you

322
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
can kind of navigate between the

323
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
different pages of the

324
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
of the application kind of makes it semi

325
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
interactive it makes it really nice way

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
to

327
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,519
walk through a prototype

328
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,839
about an hour before their presentation

329
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
they came to get me

330
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
for the last hour they've been trying to

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
get it to work and he did the whole

332
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,639
thing had stopped working been been

333
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
working for days they've been working on

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
this prototype for two weeks now

335
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
and suddenly it doesn't work none of the

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
things they click on do anything

337
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,839
and they've been trying for an hour they

338
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
can't figure out what's going on they

339
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
come down to me i look at it

340
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
does anyone want to wager a guess what

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,320
happened

342
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,200
dns good good try no no

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
windows update oh i can tell you some

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
stories about that

345
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
yeah in the middle a middle of a website

346
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
launch yeah that's a good time for

347
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,279
windows update

348
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,440
no no someone's come on somebody's got a

349
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
all right

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
well you dig into again this the

351
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
prototype is making making calls right

352
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
uh

353
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
to a back end to to pull down the static

354
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
pages right uh it pulls a little payload

355
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
and substitutes this all it's all um

356
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
um

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
in a react framework or something

358
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,519
the same thing right those pages are

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
getting intercepted and being replaced

360
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
with are you sure you want to proceed

361
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
this site's uncategorized

362
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,120
it was working yesterday it was working

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
the day before why today and why right

364
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
before the presentation is that

365
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,880
happening right i had to give them the

366
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
bad news like i can't do anything about

367
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
that but i can tell you who you can

368
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
reach out to and maybe they can help

369
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
but you know this point it's 30 minutes

370
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
to the presentation

371
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
you know i i think they wound up having

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
to call off the presentation which they

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
had set up

374
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
eventually they got it straightened out

375
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,560
they worked out something

376
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
but you can imagine the stress those

377
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
engineers were under trying to get

378
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,839
something to work and then finding out

379
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
that it didn't have anything ever there

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,959
they were sure they broke something

381
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
and they didn't

382
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,120
let's um

383
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
let's have a different team

384
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
we had a a

385
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
video streaming team

386
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
that was building products for

387
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
streaming basically tv everywhere stuff

388
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
so a lot of people were using that for

389
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
second screen

390
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,880
and they had built this stuff off so you

391
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
can run it to uh through a roku run it

392
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
to your television

393
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,000
um this is streaming versus this is this

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,279
at this point this is not necessarily

395
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,880
actually like discovery plus streaming

396
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
or that kind of thing but the precursor

397
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
to those

398
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
so they've been working on those things

399
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,759
for

400
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,920
you know the past nine months

401
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
and they they were going to

402
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
set up a bank of tvs now

403
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
in the office so they brought in three

404
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
televisions they set them up

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,279
and they just need to install the

406
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,880
application

407
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
okay so there's a

408
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
hetv application and a food network

409
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
application and a travel channel

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
application they need to install them

411
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
so those come off of a store site

412
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,320
where they get installed from

413
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
but installation doesn't work on any of

414
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,279
the tvs the installation doesn't work

415
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
they spend hours and hours trying to

416
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
figure there's a networking problem

417
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,560
there's something going on

418
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,000
you know they couldn't figure out what

419
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,120
was good they just couldn't reach the

420
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,079
store

421
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
well this

422
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,839
this actually was actually the same

423
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,680
problem right is that basically it was

424
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,399
categorized as games and so it couldn't

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
reach

426
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
right the the the

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
apple store or the the you know the

428
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,279
samsung store whichever you know where

429
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,440
it was they were going to to install

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
their applications from

431
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
were all being blocked meanwhile they'd

432
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,600
spent the entire day trying to figure

433
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
out what was wrong they reached out to a

434
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
security team which which were helpful

435
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,800
they're like ah we understand what's

436
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
going on we can we can help with that

437
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
you know give us the mac address of the

438
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
televisions and we can get in exceptions

439
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
for you

440
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,079
at this point the engineers are like i

441
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
don't know what the mac address is and i

442
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
can't figure out how to get the

443
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
the television to show it to me

444
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
what those engineers wound up doing was

445
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
taking all those televisions

446
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,760
and taking them home

447
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,679
and setting them up

448
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,959
and then bringing them back to the

449
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,839
office

450
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,359
it's fine problem will work around it

451
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,720
okay meanwhile they spent the entire day

452
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
working on something and then the end

453
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
result was

454
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
somebody is making my job difficult and

455
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,159
i will just go take this home and do it

456
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
and

457
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,559
now again eventually this kind of thing

458
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,280
was sorted out so that you know

459
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
in later you know months later when they

460
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
were doing more of these they had a way

461
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
around that right

462
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
but again developers are suddenly having

463
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,960
to

464
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,000
work around

465
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,000
problems that are making their job

466
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
difficult

467
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
let's try something else

468
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,559
does anyone know if big al has been

469
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
moved out into the knoxville zoo yet

470
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
out of his winter quarters

471
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
i don't know uh it's interesting if you

472
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
ever get a chance that the a 400 pound

473
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,320
uh

474
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,400
aldabra tortoise being moved from

475
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
uh out to his enclosures is an

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,679
interesting uh thing to do apparently

477
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,160
takes a lot of patience

478
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
but we're talking about a shell

479
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
so another team that that worked on

480
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,559
internal applications around linear

481
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
right so they're

482
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
they're building things like transcoding

483
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,960
and

484
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
uh taking raw footage converting it over

485
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
to stuff that gets sent out to

486
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,840
uh

487
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
internet or satellites or to like

488
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
there's lots of different formats lots

489
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
of editing things that happen but

490
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
there's

491
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
systems that that manage all of that

492
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
some of those sit on uh computers which

493
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
have graphics cards on them because it

494
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,480
uses the

495
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
gpu so they're basically pcs

496
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
right

497
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
so they had a problem at one point where

498
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
their monitors kicked off and saying

499
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
that none of the assets were stuck at a

500
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
certain point in the pipeline and they

501
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
were not moving up through the pipeline

502
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360
so they began investigating what went

503
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,799
wrong

504
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
this thing's been working for five years

505
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
suddenly something's wrong

506
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
they're digging through it

507
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
what they eventually

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,440
found is in the the

509
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,039
in the shell

510
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
and the

511
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,360
ssh config

512
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
had been modified

513
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
there was a bunch of lines being added

514
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,799
for

515
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,320
servers that they had no idea what they

516
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,919
were

517
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
but a bunch of servers and the keys to

518
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
access them and things like that and

519
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,480
like we don't know what these are and

520
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,600
they're suddenly you know and they're

521
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,679
right written on top of our

522
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
configurations and and what they use to

523
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,880
move assets between servers

524
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
using you know

525
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
ssh and scp

526
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
suddenly broke because these lines of

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
code were stuck on top of it

528
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
now what this was was it was uh

529
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
attempted a honeypot

530
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
right so they of course you know like i

531
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
don't know what these servers are let's

532
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
go access them and see what they are

533
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,320
maybe they're part of our stuff for

534
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,280
something and of course then they

535
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
triggered it

536
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
so that was a great idea right the idea

537
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,919
what the idea was to

538
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,559
leave things on people's computers

539
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,640
showing access to different

540
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,440
um

541
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
systems in the company

542
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
um that are actually just there just to

543
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
get you to go there and if you go there

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
right then then that then they know your

545
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
computer's compromised and then they

546
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,520
come down and

547
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
you know with guns and things or

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
something

549
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
but in this case right i mean was a

550
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,880
great idea right no one knew about it

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
um and no one was tested you know tested

552
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
this was working with different things

553
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,640
and it was overriding

554
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
uh you know configurations that were

555
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
being used now some end users may have

556
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
been infected right but then they just

557
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,919
found that they couldn't get to one of

558
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,960
the systems that they were supposed to

559
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,280
work on and they eventually figured it

560
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
out and fixed it

561
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,559
this was not a common

562
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
problem right they you roll this out on

563
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,120
a thousand computers and

564
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
but why this computer why why this one

565
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
that was part of you know an automated

566
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,799
system why it was rolled out to that one

567
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
when it was intended to be

568
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
employee computers

569
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
not not sure

570
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,880
but meanwhile again one of the

571
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
production system was was offline for a

572
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
period of time

573
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
interesting okay

574
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
i had a

575
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
a team that was responsible for doing

576
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,960
maintenance and quality assurance on

577
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
some of the applications

578
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
uh and there was a third party uh group

579
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,440
that needed to swap out one of the

580
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,919
libraries used on some of our websites

581
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,000
and our quality assurance group wanted

582
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,360
to make sure that that

583
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
when they changed that out that that

584
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
wasn't going to break anything

585
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
the only way to do that was to put it on

586
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
the website and try it

587
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,559
and for whatever reason they couldn't

588
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,640
really put it on our test systems they

589
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
couldn't just they couldn't upload the

590
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
asset because the asset wasn't actually

591
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
on our server

592
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,159
so fine use a use a proxy system like

593
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
charles proxy and you know substitute it

594
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
out to pull the library from somewhere

595
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
else

596
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
unfortunately we had some product people

597
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
and some other people that wanted to use

598
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,360
it they weren't really familiar with how

599
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,400
to do that

600
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
you have to set that up for everybody

601
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,919
great i was managing stuff at the time

602
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,960
like you know what i can just create a

603
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,799
little proxy you can just overwrite

604
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,320
their host file send it to there and

605
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,280
then that'll send you right to

606
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,039
foodnetwork.com

607
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
and just swap out that one file and just

608
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,039
pass everything through

609
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,440
wrote that up in an hour or so

610
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
they were you know they were able to use

611
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
that solve the problem

612
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,760
but the next day i came in

613
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
and that server it was down

614
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,799
i'm not

615
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,320
whatever well i just restarted

616
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,600
and the team hadn't had a chance to use

617
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
it yet so they they were they still were

618
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
going to be using it

619
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,880
and i come in the next day and it's down

620
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
again that's weird

621
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
so that's why i started digging into

622
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,039
that

623
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,640
and

624
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
found that somebody was hacking it

625
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
like it was under attack i mean you know

626
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,480
this is a dead simple proxy you can't it

627
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
won't proxy just anything you it would

628
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
only proxy to the our one website and

629
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,799
only if you had the the right host

630
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,880
headers and only

631
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
um but somebody was passing uh things

632
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,760
trying to attack that website that proxy

633
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
directly

634
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,559
which was crashing because he didn't

635
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,400
know what to do with it like not like i

636
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
don't have host header doesn't match

637
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,559
nothing i don't know what to do with it

638
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,000
so i tracked down the ip address where i

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
was coming from i'm figuring like

640
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
somebody's somebody's computer in the in

641
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,159
the company has been compromised so

642
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,640
let's track that back and i'll go notify

643
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,679
people

644
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,279
and i traced it back to somebody in the

645
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,240
security organization

646
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
the security team was hacking one of my

647
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,720
systems

648
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
oh okay um so for a brief moment i

649
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
considered hacking them back

650
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
i decided that probably wouldn't end

651
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,159
well

652
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,200
um

653
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
and really i didn't have the time either

654
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
so

655
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
uh what i did is i just i just updated

656
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
the application so that it ignored any

657
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
requests it didn't know how to handle

658
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
and just dropped it and that solved the

659
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
problem so now they can hack it all they

660
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
want they would just ignore them

661
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,799
but it was still annoying

662
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
all right so let's uh i could talk for

663
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
another three hours about stories like

664
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600
these and like catch me later and i can

665
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,799
share a bunch of ones some of them are

666
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,880
funny some of them are sad

667
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,720
um but

668
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
let's talk more about why

669
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,520
what is the goal of security

670
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,320
right

671
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,679
the security

672
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,640
groups

673
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
in your company are focused on

674
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
protection

675
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,679
right protecting the company assets

676
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
protect you know the data customer pii

677
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
things of those nature about reducing

678
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,799
risk

679
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
reducing the risk that assets or data

680
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,120
being compromised or misused

681
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
now

682
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,799
in software development

683
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,279
they're about delivering products and

684
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,840
data to

685
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,760
customers right about making new and

686
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
improved products and pushing it out on

687
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,400
a rapid schedule

688
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,400
they're they're they're tasked often

689
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
with innovation and coming up with new

690
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,159
ways of doing something how to do it

691
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,159
faster how to do it cheaper how to come

692
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,480
up with some way to meet this customer's

693
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,840
need that we can't figure out how to do

694
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,279
so you've got on one side we've got the

695
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,360
the desire to limit risk limit access to

696
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,440
our assets limit access to the data and

697
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
then you have another group in the

698
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,880
company who is trying to share our

699
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
assets and share the data to the

700
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
customers because

701
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
that's what we're getting paid to do

702
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,240
that's where the company is making their

703
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,200
money

704
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
right they're driving the the software

705
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
development group in most cases not in

706
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
all cases

707
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
are

708
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,880
driving

709
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
um

710
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
the company value

711
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,720
right this is the product the company is

712
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
selling to make money or is the data

713
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
they're selling or

714
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
whatever right

715
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,240
and that puts these two groups at odds

716
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
right one of them is trying to

717
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,520
you know limit access and one is trying

718
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
to push access

719
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
and if we stop the one group from

720
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,840
pushing that access we don't make any

721
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
money and then the company goes out of

722
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,520
business

723
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,880
so who's the bad guy here

724
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
is it the software you know is it the

725
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
security teams i mean i've worked with a

726
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,240
lot of security people

727
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
one-on-one and they are great people and

728
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,120
they are interested in protecting the

729
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,600
company

730
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
is it the software development

731
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
team who is

732
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,639
um

733
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,520
that is uh continuing to develop and

734
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
push boundaries and are in some cases

735
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
creating some of the vulnerabilities

736
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
that the security team is trying to

737
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,799
patch up

738
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,559
they're good guys too

739
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,720
they are trying they what they are doing

740
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
is what is allowing the company to make

741
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,960
money

742
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,919
so really i mean really there isn't any

743
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,080
bad guys here

744
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,760
right they're just two groups of people

745
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,080
that are that are trying to to do their

746
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
jobs

747
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,320
and they're they're in conflict

748
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,480
so what can we do to help

749
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
how can we make this better

750
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
so i've got a couple of points i'd like

751
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
to talk about so let's start with number

752
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,279
one

753
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,039
i'd like you to think first

754
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
what could go wrong

755
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,960
who could be impacted

756
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
right identify those things

757
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,919
whatever change you're making whatever

758
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
system you're putting in place

759
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
somehow that can go wrong

760
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
who would it affect when it does how bad

761
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
would it be

762
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
okay

763
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,559
can we test it

764
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,399
how do we validate it how do we how do

765
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,080
we check for the ways it could go wrong

766
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,279
and make sure that's not happening

767
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
can we put it in standby mode can we put

768
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,960
it into a

769
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
use beta users beta testers in different

770
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
groups to try it out

771
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
can we

772
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,159
recruit people

773
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,720
to actually do testing

774
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
because because having the same person

775
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
implement something do the testing

776
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,760
usually always

777
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,600
works poorly

778
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,480
and that's something we learned in

779
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,559
software development long long ago right

780
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,000
the developer

781
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
you don't want the developer testing it

782
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
but what we see in a lot of cases is

783
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,520
that is that that same thing's not being

784
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
applied in other cases recruit some

785
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
people to help test

786
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,080
that can look at it from the outside

787
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
communicate

788
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
and let's be honest this has got to be

789
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
the hardest piece of this

790
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,559
let people know what changes are coming

791
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,399
let them know what the impacts could be

792
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,039
right what are the potential problems

793
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,720
who to contact when it happens

794
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,120
those things that

795
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,840
bring the other groups in and like them

796
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
feel like their their problems are

797
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,279
understood

798
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,799
right instead of

799
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,159
things being dumped on them and then

800
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
having to deal with it

801
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,799
right

802
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,960
just knowing about it ahead of time so

803
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,080
when it comes up they're like you know

804
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,159
this could be that thing that was that

805
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,039
they said last week was rolling out

806
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,039
right

807
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,519
but again of these three i'd say

808
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,679
communication is probably the most

809
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,120
difficult

810
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,559
it always is and i work for a media

811
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,559
company

812
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,720
so i think it goes a little so let's go

813
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
a little beyond that

814
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,080
what i want to see is the security

815
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,320
groups and the software engineering

816
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
groups work as partners

817
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
right

818
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,120
help them with training help with

819
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,039
understanding problems

820
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
communicate with them recruit those

821
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,559
people in to help test

822
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,760
identify

823
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
super users in those groups and go hey

824
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,120
we're going to make a change can we roll

825
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,279
it out to a select people first have

826
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,120
them try it out and then when something

827
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,399
goes wrong

828
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,840
can we roll it back

829
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,240
right if the teams are working together

830
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
and partnering on it

831
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,440
things will go

832
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,760
much much better

833
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,559
because when when is when security or

834
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,640
any other sort of thing is imposed on a

835
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
group from the outside

836
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,519
in an authoritarian manner

837
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,039
those groups try to fight back against

838
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
it or they try to work around it right

839
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,760
and

840
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
and what they're doing to work around it

841
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,679
just makes the security vulnerabilities

842
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,720
worse

843
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
right the people that really care that

844
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,760
those those engineers that cared about

845
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
security vulnerabilities

846
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
start trying to work around the stuff

847
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,120
because they still have to get their job

848
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,159
done

849
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,159
instead of trying to do it well and

850
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,200
trying to

851
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,799
integrate security in the right way

852
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,640
because they're like fine some people

853
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,240
are just smashing us with us

854
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
i've seen a lot of conference talks

855
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
where people stand up and and talk about

856
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,159
their individual use case and how that

857
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,360
must solve the problem for everybody

858
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,399
so

859
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,760
let's just stop here and just point out

860
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,720
that that's not the case here

861
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,200
everybody's situation is different

862
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,919
okay um in many of the company some of

863
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,279
the companies i've worked at right

864
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
delivering products quickly

865
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,519
right

866
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,039
we measure the time from ideation

867
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,039
to the time that it is

868
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,240
um delivered to the end user

869
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
right and we do you know measure that

870
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,200
like in hours

871
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
right once a product person says this is

872
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,960
what i want to do

873
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,640
and when is it actually on that

874
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,760
application in the customer's hands

875
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,919
right in the past and in other companies

876
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,279
right that's measured in months

877
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,720
you know if you've got a three-month

878
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
turnaround time

879
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,840
you've got plenty of time for things to

880
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
go wrong and and to get it fixed and

881
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
things like that but when developers are

882
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
getting pushed to like we're expecting

883
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,159
this new change you're working on today

884
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,559
to be in production tomorrow

885
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,919
a four-hour

886
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,080
delay throws everything off

887
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
but like i said it depends if you're are

888
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
you working in a financial

889
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,399
institution in the military in something

890
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,719
like hey we can we can we can we're fine

891
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
with a much slower pace

892
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,199
and we want to and can prioritize the

893
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,239
security over that

894
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,320
so just you know bear those in mind

895
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,159
all right

896
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,119
i'm going to do one more story

897
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,679
i had moved out of doing software

898
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
management and into working some other

899
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,679
things i was doing devops and working on

900
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,879
automation and other things of that

901
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
nature

902
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,960
but the security teams had reached out

903
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
to the development organization for

904
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
these websites that we were

905
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
managing

906
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,919
and asked for some help

907
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,119
and while i wasn't managing the software

908
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,119
development at the time

909
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,880
they asked if i would step in because

910
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
you know

911
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,079
i got along well with security people

912
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
and you know i could probably best

913
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
understand what it is that they were

914
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
asking for and figure out what we needed

915
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,680
to do to help them

916
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
so they wanted to talk about web

917
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,200
application firewalls

918
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,520
ah yes waff

919
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,200
familiar with it

920
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,160
um

921
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,560
we've actually got at the time we had

922
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
our own custom version sort of built

923
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,599
into our applications we got a home

924
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,280
built

925
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,040
worked pretty well

926
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,640
it's not the same thing as having a

927
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,680
professional product though

928
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,359
um

929
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,040
i had uh

930
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,320
pitched rolling out uh our

931
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,119
you know one of the high-end uh

932
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,359
firewall systems with our system before

933
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,960
we ran it through management and they

934
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
were not comfortable with spending the

935
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
money at the time okay fine so i

936
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,640
let our you know security engineer know

937
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
all this kind of stuff they're like well

938
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,400
we want to use this one

939
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,000
you want to use this this web

940
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
application firewall actually it's

941
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
exactly the same one i want to use but

942
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,079
myself

943
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,160
so that's awesome but i wasn't able to

944
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,880
sell the cost on it last time

945
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,760
they're like no problem we've already

946
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,079
paid for it

947
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,400
okay well then i just i can i can sell

948
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,800
that now

949
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,040
so what do you want to do

950
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
we want to know how to work with you to

951
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,359
roll this out

952
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,599
okay well let's talk about a plan

953
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,560
um can we uh provide some training to

954
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,160
some of the engineers in the in the

955
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
group and some of the quality assurance

956
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,079
people to how to work with it how to

957
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,119
test it

958
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
great we can do that let's set that up

959
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,800
all right how do we actually roll this

960
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,680
out

961
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
how do we test it and validate it let's

962
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,320
make a plan

963
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
so

964
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
worked with him

965
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
laid out a plan to

966
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
change a configuration that would affect

967
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,599
not affect our production systems and

968
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,960
allow some people to go through and just

969
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,400
make sure that just directing the

970
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,760
traffic through the web application

971
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,480
firewall would not have any bearing

972
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,599
right because they're like oh no it

973
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,200
won't make any difference like it'll

974
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,400
just go through this waffle won't do

975
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,480
anything it'll be turned off

976
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,800
but we've made a change

977
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
something could go wrong let's test it

978
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,839
let's make those changes and then test

979
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,280
it

980
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,359
and if that works

981
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,119
now we can go ahead and push that up to

982
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:21,760
the

983
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,720
up to production and we can put the web

984
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,760
application firewall in standby mode

985
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,520
so it'll just execute its rules and log

986
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,720
anything that it said it would have

987
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,839
blocked or something like that just make

988
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,280
a big log of them

989
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,119
let that run for a couple weeks

990
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,880
now let's have some engineers go look

991
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,079
through that and look for stuff that

992
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,440
should have been

993
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,119
that needs to get let through right

994
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,720
things that were

995
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,800
our biggest fear with these is that it

996
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,839
it triggering on legitimate traffic that

997
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,560
just looks really suspicious

998
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
and you know we certainly have plenty of

999
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,640
cases where we've written stuff that

1000
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
looks suspicious to ourselves

1001
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,839
great they were fine with that

1002
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,040
and then once we've gone through that

1003
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
find any issues um work with the

1004
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,359
security team to help put the modify

1005
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,040
those rules to fix it go back through

1006
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,119
the process again check it again

1007
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,400
one of the rings all good then push it

1008
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,839
to production and that was the process

1009
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,839
we went through and it worked great

1010
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
the engineers were happy the site was

1011
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,160
good we put a new level of security in

1012
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
place

1013
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,079
the security team helped us out but this

1014
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,880
was an example now of partnering

1015
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,160
with the two teams together

1016
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,359
all right

1017
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,040
i'm going to

1018
