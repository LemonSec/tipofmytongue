1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,240
thanks everybody that's hung around this

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,600
uh long i know uh doing

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
conferences all day can be a lot going

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
from speaker to speaker let me swap this

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,440
up

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,639
all right

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,960
so uh as was mentioned before we're

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,239
going to be talking about adversary

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,400
emulation and automating adaptive

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
adversaries

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
a little bit about who i am i'm the

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
adversary emulation lead at scythe

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
now that's only been my role for the

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
past year or so

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
prior to that worked at sandia national

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,679
labs i was on the information design

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,440
assurance red team there for a number of

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
years probably about five years total

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
and i also worked at

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,559
mitre on the mitre attack team

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,640
worked on caldera and the attack

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
evaluations so uh if if you know me and

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
you know some of my talks attack is

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
going to pop up so just warning you in

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,800
advance

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,520
now our word of the day is scale and

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
when it comes to talking about

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
adversaries especially adaptive

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
adversaries they're looking at having

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,920
bigger impacts so automating their

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
actions those types of things that's

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
really what they're trying to do day to

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
day and ultimately what i'm looking to

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
give you all in this talk is not only

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
just sort of a view in how you can do it

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
but also just how to think about it and

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
give you some examples and sort of a

38
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
modular framework to work through so

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,240
that you can

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
pick an adversary that you care about

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
now everyone's going to have different

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
adversaries that target their either

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
industry or that you might be worried

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
about so that's something that you can

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
sub in whatever adversary you want as we

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
walk through these examples and the idea

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
behind this is that this is something

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
that you can hopefully take to your

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
day-to-day job and use

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
as well as something that you can sort

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
of follow along with here

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,119
so automation really allows consistency

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
at scale this is something that's really

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
important uh sort of a simple concept

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,759
but overall is why we want to automate

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
things

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
getting a bunch of experts together in a

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
room is something that's great but

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
trying to get them to hack everybody on

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
the planet if you're a nation state is

61
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,640
something that's much more difficult to

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
do you need tools you need ways to scale

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
that expertise

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,318
and so that's where when we're talking

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
about adaptability it's really

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
capability what can they do consistently

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
what are they able to build and what is

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
the objectives they're able to

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
consistently

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
basically fulfill for whatever their

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,160
mission is

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
now that's why i sort of like to sub

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
this here is we're actually not

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
automating the adaptive adversaries what

75
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
does that mean it's mostly the

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
capability their own development how

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
they do research and how they transition

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
that research into something that's

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
scalable

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
now

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,879
with something when it comes to red

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
teamers pen testers things like that is

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
that they like

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
it's easy to think of yourself as

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
adaptable because you can get rip past

86
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
anything if you're giving enough time

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
money uh you've got something like kali

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
linux and that's sort of how you gear up

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
now this is not how adversaries gear up

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
they don't get a special version of kali

91
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
linux necessarily they have a couple

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
different tools and that's where we talk

93
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,239
about scale individual people with kali

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
linux frankly does not scale it's not

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
something that by itself

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
works at scaling up to the nation state

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
levels

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
and so that's that's really the main

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
message here when we're talking about

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
scales that individual expertise it

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
doesn't scale it's not something that uh

102
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
it's good for trying things out it's

103
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
good for learning uh lessons and maybe

104
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
for business impact and the types of

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
tests you're trying to do that that can

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
work but when we're talking about

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,319
adversaries that are constantly adapting

108
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
to a changing defensive environment that

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
have to target different organizations

110
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,120
they can't afford to have new people

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
every time try and relearn something and

112
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
so that's why we want to talk about what

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,480
are some of these tools what are some of

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
these ways adversaries do it

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
now this is how adversaries gear up so

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
if you're familiar with the left the

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
screenshot on the left side here this is

118
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
cobalt strike and

119
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
lots of adversaries especially

120
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
ransomware threat actors have been using

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
cracked versions of cobalt strike

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
and like we have seen a couple i think

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
it was about a year ago now uh somebody

124
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
didn't get paid in the ransomware world

125
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,319
and as such they leaked out a playbook

126
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
and so this is the kanti ransomware that

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,320
was leaked and of course it was in

128
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
russian and then it was translated and

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
so what you're looking at is the

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
translation there on the right

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
now

132
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
this is better documentation than any

133
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
offensive security tool or

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
playbook run book whatever you want to

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,639
call it that i've ever seen or anyone

136
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
really had seen and the idea behind this

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
is that the operators the people that

138
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,960
are going to be using this can copy and

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
paste that is the only skill they need

140
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
to know they can copy and paste

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
everything in fact they do it so well

142
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
that if someone did a typo in the run

143
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
book they will copy paste that too and

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
it won't work but that's the level that

145
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
they are trying to go to they are

146
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
looking for scale they want anybody they

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
want to give them a cobalt strike

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
terminal and say just copy and paste

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
these commands that's all it takes and

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
so that is scalable because if you can

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
get anybody that can copy and paste

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,680
that's a much easier skill to teach than

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
somebody that needs to be a red team or

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,639
penetration testing expert

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
so how do we measure this capability and

156
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
how adversaries are looking at it the

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
overall concept of this comes from

158
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
something called worldly maps it's simon

159
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,199
wardley does value chain mapping and the

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,199
idea behind this was that it was

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,560
something for

162
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
looking at how to map businesses in

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
competition

164
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
and it really breaks down to three

165
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
i sort of took it butchered it a little

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
bit and broke it down into sort of

167
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
infosec terms and i've broken it down

168
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
into three major bins when you're

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
measuring capability the first thing is

170
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
research it's everything starts as an

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
idea you've heard lots of talks here

172
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
that talk about some of the different

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
research ideas as people are sort of

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
pushing the boundaries of their field

175
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
and this is where things are unproven

176
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
thing a theoretical attack may or may

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
not work

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,440
and in this example i'm going to give

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
before diving into sort of the cyber

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,199
security example is wishing to fasten

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
two things together

182
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,800
now the next thing after we have

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,319
research is we have custom this is where

184
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
you have your proof of concept something

185
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
that is custom built that takes an

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
expert to operate it and it may not even

187
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
work every time and so this is where if

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
you have fasteners wanna fasten two

189
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
things together uh and same with like

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
nuts and bolts used to be that artisans

191
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,039
made these uh nuts and bolts

192
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
individually only one worked with the

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
the only artisan that built it was the

194
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
only one that knew exactly how to carve

195
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
it out correctly

196
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
and that's great but it again doesn't

197
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
scale because when you need to build a

198
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
ship or you need to build uh you know

199
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
these days anything from ikea for

200
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
instance you need a lot of these

201
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
and so that's where the product part

202
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
comes in is that this is really a

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
maturation of

204
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
any sort of capability you started as

205
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,800
research but as you're trying to scale

206
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,919
it you're really trying to get to

207
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,880
product

208
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,440
and so that's what we're going to do for

209
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
talking about cyber security

210
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
capabilities

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,440
now of course let's dive in and look at

212
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,319
reframing this challenge with our new

213
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,479
three bins that we talked about and this

214
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
is where i warned you before mitre

215
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
attacks coming in because this is a way

216
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
it's an open source framework it's a

217
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
really good way of charting how real

218
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
adversaries are performing their actions

219
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,199
now if you're unfamiliar about how mitre

220
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,960
attack works or haven't or you've heard

221
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
about it but don't use it it has

222
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
basically three layers of sort of

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
abstractions uh the broadest one is

224
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
tactics at the bottom and this is going

225
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
to be the objectives adversaries are

226
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
trying to achieve it's sort of the 10

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,039
000 foot view it's things like initial

228
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
access resources that kind of thing now

229
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,479
under each of those tactics you have

230
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
specific techniques and this is where we

231
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
start to dive a little bit deeper into

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,759
each of these things techniques are

233
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
going to be the technical means by which

234
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
adversaries achieve those goals

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
and then we have our procedures which

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
are our most granular this is going to

237
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
be the exact things that the adversary

238
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,599
ran on a system for instance in order to

239
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
achieve their goal

240
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,000
so let's look at starting from the

241
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
broadest drilling down deep

242
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
and this is where credential access is

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
an example of a tactic it has this

244
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
little t number t a and then t is for

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
technique and then procedures really

246
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
don't have

247
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
a mapping so that's where we'll talk a

248
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919
little bit about some of the challenges

249
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
of that a little bit later

250
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,399
but when we're talking about mapping

251
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
your different tactics across these this

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
is where you can either map your team

253
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
you can map the tools you're using you

254
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,160
can map a specific adversary now defense

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
evasion is something that tends to be

256
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
something that is sort of cutting edge

257
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,040
but a lot of adversaries and red teamers

258
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
they all have this as custom right they

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
all have to build this each and every

260
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
time give credit to the edr vendors

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
they do a pretty good job and or at

262
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
least spend a lot of money on people

263
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,519
that do good jobs on building out really

264
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,880
good

265
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
signatures based on specific tools for

266
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,080
instance meme cats it would be one of

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
those but defensive asian to make sure

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
those things run tends to be something

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
that you have to do over and over again

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
and continually do so that is custom

271
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,600
now discovery this is something looking

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
at

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
assets on a network adversary's trying

274
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
to discover things for lateral movement

275
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
things like that this is something that

276
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
does tend to be more of a product and

277
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
map for instance

278
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
and so this is how you would begin to

279
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
map out the different tactics that

280
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
you're concerned about either about the

281
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
adversary you're concerned about or you

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
can map your own capability

283
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
now once you've gone through all this

284
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,640
you've got this nice sort of stacks and

285
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
you'll notice in this case we don't have

286
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
a bunch of research partially because

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
research is so resource intensive and

288
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,120
not every team has people that folk are

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
focused on research most of the time it

290
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
is focused on what are the products we

291
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,760
use and also what are things that we can

292
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
supplement whether it's integration

293
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
stuff like that to sort of speed those

294
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,680
up

295
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,160
and that's where we get to attack chains

296
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
so this is where you can start to build

297
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
things together to identify what are

298
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,839
those specific techniques are sorry

299
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,959
tactics

300
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,920
uh and which ones are we do we rely on

301
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,079
specific people for this is something i

302
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
always remind everybody with adversaries

303
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,640
too adversaries have deadlines uh that

304
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
was another thing lots of leaks out of

305
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
the the conti ransomware camp they had

306
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
some of their emails and chats and all

307
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
of those things got spilled and this was

308
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,279
over their support of russia in the for

309
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
the war in ukraine and so somebody

310
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
spilled all of those things they went

311
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
through uh they have everything from

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
reviews with managers they have some of

313
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,000
the same problems i'm sure you all are

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
going through at organizations where

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,839
someone new got hired and they're making

316
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,880
more with than the previous people

317
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
and birthdays all of that stuff and so

318
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
that's something you have to remember

319
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
they have expertise too they have to

320
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
chart this stuff out too

321
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
and so they don't have it's not just a

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
blob of expertise that somehow just can

323
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
go after anything they have to choose

324
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,959
both the targets based on the expertise

325
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
they have as well as try and map and

326
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,720
build new capabilities so that's why

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,160
it's really important to be able to map

328
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
all of these things is that you can

329
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,320
understand where where they're going to

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
shift

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
now not all ttps are equal right and

332
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,240
this is something where i give the

333
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
example of if i'm going to start you and

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,959
say you're starting externally uh from

335
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,240
an engagement and you have to do

336
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
discovery and that's that's where you're

337
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,560
starting versus you have a persistent

338
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
agent on in a network what are you going

339
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
to choose if your objective is to get in

340
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
the network you're going to choose

341
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,360
persistence every time but that's

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
because it's harder right and this is

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
why you can identify those resource

344
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
heavy points and especially if you have

345
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
specific things in research that's where

346
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,839
that is super resource heavy it is going

347
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,399
to require experts and expertise and

348
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
that's why when you're looking at this

349
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
you want to shift things to the right

350
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
and so that's really what we're looking

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
at is shifting all of these things as

352
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
much as we can to the right now every

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
ttp is not going to be able to be

354
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,959
shifted and your team might not have the

355
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,040
budget for instance to buy a tool or a

356
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
product that puts

357
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
puts your k your capability in most of

358
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,480
the product but adversaries can't either

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
ttps and just general adversary

360
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
operations they do have a lot of

361
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,079
difficulties for instance users users

362
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,839
always do different things and while we

363
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,519
most of the time talk about how users

364
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,200
make things difficult for defenders

365
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
which they tend to

366
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
it also means that attackers have to

367
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
discover what's happening in an

368
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
environment before they can do things

369
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
like lateral movement unless they have

370
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
an exploit they tend to leverage

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
whatever is in the environment which

372
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
requires waiting and learning about

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
where they've landed and so this is

374
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
where you really want to see where are

375
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
single points of failure too there's

376
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
another thing if you have a team full of

377
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
people and you rely on one person to get

378
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
you initial access or to do defense

379
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
evasion each time what happens if they

380
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
leave

381
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
right we're in the middle or towards the

382
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
end or i don't know how they're charting

383
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,480
it of the great resignation

384
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
right i've talked to many security

385
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,000
companies that are all like hey if you

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
know anyone good send them my way

387
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
and so this is something that's

388
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
increasingly uh something that more and

389
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
more organizations are looking at is how

390
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
do we bake expertise as we get it even

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
for a short time into either a specific

392
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,839
tool or something that can be

393
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
transitioned to

394
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
to someone new

395
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
now let's talk about how we can

396
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,120
potentially shift right

397
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
one is automating technique changes so

398
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
this is something that mitre attack is

399
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
updated uh they do a big update twice a

400
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
year adverse areas are really active

401
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
they actually uh

402
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440
you have all these new cyber threat

403
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,959
intel reports that come out on a pretty

404
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
regular basis sometimes it's monthly

405
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
sometimes it's more than that and then

406
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
you have big vulnerabilities that pop up

407
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
and everybody publishes something on it

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
and so if you're following some of this

409
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
stuff you need you need to

410
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
make sure that if any zero day pops up

411
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
you can deal with it but you still have

412
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,839
to deal with everything else too and

413
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,800
that's where automation comes in now one

414
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,959
of the challenges with automation is

415
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,839
that

416
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
this is this top one is i think one of

417
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,440
the biggest challenges in this space is

418
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
that we tend to really focus on the

419
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,199
research and custom

420
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,720
parts of what we're building we

421
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
researchers want to

422
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
come up with the research identify

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
something that they're doing build a

424
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
proof of concept to showcase that it is

425
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
an idea that works

426
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
and then that's where we leave it but

427
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
the challenge is that that is still

428
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,680
something that's important and needs to

429
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
be brought into a product eventually uh

430
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
for a lot of those it's it's

431
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
vulnerabilities for instance that are

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
still there that are still going to be

433
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
deployed in systems i mean legacy

434
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
systems there was a talk earlier that

435
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
sort of talked about all the legacy

436
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
devices that are still across networks

437
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
and so this is why making sure you're

438
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
able to identify old things through

439
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
automation and scale is really important

440
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
not all techniques are scalable this is

441
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,639
something else that is is good in some

442
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
terms and is bad in the others uh it's

443
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
good in that if every technique was

444
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,440
scalable it means ever adversaries could

445
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
create worms or easier

446
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
and faster which that luckily is not

447
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
necessarily been the case but it also

448
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,639
means that it requires more expertise or

449
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
people to work through and make sure

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,360
that something is tested in your

451
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
environment on a on a more recurring

452
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
basis and then this last one here is

453
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,720
something that a lot of businesses

454
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
struggle with is that not all techniques

455
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,079
are relevant

456
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
especially when it comes to mitre attack

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
and people are hearing about it more and

458
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,959
more and more they think we need to

459
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
check every box we need to make sure

460
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
that we have 100 miter attack coverage

461
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
that is not how miter attack is supposed

462
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
to be used from the attack team

463
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
themselves they will tell you that it is

464
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
not a check box exercise and so that's

465
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
something that you

466
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,880
that is hard to sort of instill in

467
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,639
leadership when you're showing graphics

468
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,759
and they're like why do we have all

469
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
these boxes that aren't covered and

470
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
saying it doesn't matter to us is not

471
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
something they always understand

472
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
so those are challenges here with

473
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
automation is that trying to figure out

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
what do we want to automate and what is

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
going to and we have to prioritize

476
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
now let's give an example of why

477
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
automation is important when it comes to

478
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
adapting to adversaries who also can

479
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
make a shift so let's start with

480
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,360
powershell um powershell is something

481
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
that continues to be a problem uh let's

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
see over a decade i don't even remember

483
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
when it was first introduced but as far

484
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
as security talks addressing powershell

485
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
dave kennedy gave one i think back in

486
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
2012 2013 uh that talked about

487
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
holy moly like powershell is a huge

488
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
attack surface and if you're a pen

489
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
tester like you can just run away with

490
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,079
it

491
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
now there's been better detections and

492
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,680
things like that that have come around

493
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
powershell

494
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
but there have been other research

495
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
techniques that have been built into

496
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,000
products that people aren't as aware of

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
and that's unmanaged powershell it's

498
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
powershell without executing

499
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,039
powershell.exe you call the dll directly

500
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
and this is something that requires a

501
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,000
different set of detections and so this

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,559
is really key as an adversary can switch

503
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
from powershell to unmanaged powershell

504
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,439
and

505
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
previous detections could be useless

506
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
so you need a way to do that

507
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,600
now

508
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
the question might be how difficult

509
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
would that be for adversaries

510
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,840
the top here is a little screenshot and

511
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
a snippet from

512
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
that conti playbook they have this

513
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,679
powershell invoked nightmare which is

514
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,080
print nightmare and then they have

515
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,799
basically adding a new new user and this

516
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,000
second one

517
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
is a quick cheat sheet from cobalt

518
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,960
strike that shows exactly how hard it

519
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
would be for the adversaries that are

520
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
building this to make this switch in

521
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
their playbooks it would be literally

522
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
switching out the word powershell to

523
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
power pick remember i said earlier

524
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
they're copy and pasting everything they

525
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
don't they're not going to think about

526
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
it they will copy and paste it and this

527
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
is something that's very easy for

528
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
adversaries to change it should also be

529
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
very easy for you to change in your

530
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,080
environment because this is something

531
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,000
that's potentially coming at literally

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,320
any time i don't actually know why

533
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
adversaries haven't picked up on this

534
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
yet but sort of thankful that they have

535
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,360
it

536
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,039
because when it happens

537
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
they will have unfortunately more

538
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,360
success unless more and more people are

539
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,000
testing against these

540
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
so this is where you really need some

541
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
sort of tool that can do this if you

542
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080
haven't worked with some of the red

543
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
teaming tools before there is something

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
called the c2 matrix this is an open

545
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,480
source community-led project

546
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
and it basically has all of these c2

547
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
platforms and for a while there every

548
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
week a new red teamer was releasing a

549
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
new command to control framework on

550
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
twitter and so they took all of those

551
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
and they've charted out the capabilities

552
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,799
so that you can see what you need to

553
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
test it has open source solutions on

554
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
there as well as paid ones so you can do

555
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,400
comparisons

556
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
so it also if you don't want to look at

557
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
the google sheet it does have like a

558
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,679
questionnaire where you can ask about

559
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
the different types of features that you

560
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
want to test and it'll tell you which

561
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
ones you can use

562
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
now adversary emulation is another way

563
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
that we can tackle some of the

564
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
challenges

565
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
let's talk about some challenges with

566
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
that though is that it is still a very

567
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,080
expert driven space uh and so this is

568
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
that's really the biggest issue with it

569
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,520
some of the breach and attack simulation

570
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
vendors are trying to address some of it

571
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,200
but largely right now the pairing of

572
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
cyber threat intelligence with uh with

573
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,039
red teamers that can essentially execute

574
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,000
it

575
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
either in a defanged or benign way is

576
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
something that is still again very

577
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
expert driven and so that's that's

578
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
something that is an issue here now it

579
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
can also solve some really hard problems

580
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
for us so let's talk about an

581
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
adversary's capability shift initial

582
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,640
access shifts from custom to product

583
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
what's the way that they would do this

584
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
how do you buy initial access well you

585
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
can buy a zero day now this is something

586
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,280
that previously sort of the economics of

587
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,679
ransomware uh sort of changed the

588
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
equation around it zero days were

589
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
expensive and they have continued to get

590
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
more expensive but

591
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,520
for instance uh the kante ransomware

592
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,200
group made two billion dollars i think

593
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
last year so

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
that's a lot of money and they can

595
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
probably buy a lot of researchers and a

596
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,039
lot and they can turn that money and a

597
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
zero day into money really easily and

598
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,000
really quickly right and that's another

599
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
thing with like uh the f5 exploit that

600
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,039
came out most of the time if something

601
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
hits really quickly

602
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
most adversaries especially when we're

603
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,679
talking about ransomware they do the

604
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,520
same thing they're just they're doing

605
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
everything else the same they're just

606
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,679
shifting how they do initial access

607
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,720
now

608
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
if you're not familiar with zerodium

609
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
they're a exploit vendor company and if

610
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
you can't see all of these for instance

611
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,480
a windows remote code execution with

612
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,039
zero click so no user interaction if you

613
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
have one of those to sell to them you'll

614
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
make a cool mill

615
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
just like that

616
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,919
so my question is is this in your budget

617
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,760
right if you want to do

618
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,159
a zero day to make sure that you're

619
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,640
keeping pace with adversaries then this

620
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
is what it potentially is going to cost

621
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
you and remember this is if you're a

622
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
researcher that has one not if you're

623
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
trying to buy it which i'm guessing has

624
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,039
a slight markup

625
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,960
so this is something just to keep in

626
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
mind and i still have to have

627
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
conversations with people when they say

628
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
we want zero day exploit testing and i

629
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,840
pull up this chart and ask them if they

630
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
want to add that to the quote

631
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,679
so that's something that there's an

632
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,960
easier way

633
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,880
and if we want to do this from sort of

634
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,960
the blue team perspective it's assume

635
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
breach testing assume the adversary gets

636
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,840
in

637
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
all right what would they do next and so

638
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
this is this covers a lot of different

639
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
scenarios even beyond the

640
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,360
zero day we have insider threats we have

641
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
uh whether someone clicks an email

642
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
that's something that always it is with

643
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,440
all the security training that we have

644
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
these days there are still spear

645
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,679
phishing emails that will land every

646
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
single time there are people in your

647
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,159
organizations that are paid to open

648
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,200
emails

649
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
and that's something i'll give my

650
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
example here if the head of hr gets a

651
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,440
proton mail email from someone that it

652
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
contains an attachment and says this is

653
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
an accusation of sexual harassment of a

654
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,760
vp or the ceo of the company and you

655
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
need to enable macros to see it

656
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
they're going to click it every time

657
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,600
because they should it is their job

658
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
right to make sure that they're checking

659
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
that the company is would be covered and

660
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
that's potentially a plausible scenario

661
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
so they're going to click on that and

662
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
they will do it probably every time

663
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,159
there's other scenarios too so you need

664
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,480
to assume that's going to happen and

665
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,159
adversaries don't get very creative

666
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
after that these the same things over

667
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,159
and over and over again so that's where

668
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,640
assume breach testing allows you while

669
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
it's a little bit of an extract an

670
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
abstraction it allows you to tackle a

671
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
lot of those scenarios all at once same

672
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,679
with insider threats

673
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,159
now moving up a little bit into

674
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
something a bit more granular this is a

675
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
technique a specific technique id and in

676
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,039
this case it's actually a sub technique

677
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
which attack couldn't just keep it to

678
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
ttp they had to make it a little bit

679
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
more complicated

680
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,120
and so that's why they added sub

681
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,080
techniques a few about two years ago and

682
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
so under credential access we have this

683
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
os credential dumping lsas memory uh the

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
tool that made this popular is mimi cats

685
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
so you're going to have to do this with

686
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,760
all of your specific tactics that we've

687
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
mapped out here and so this is what it

688
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,120
might look like

689
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
now even assume breach scenario user

690
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
execution is a general technique that

691
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,799
they have that includes a lot of those

692
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,240
things that i mentioned it's got

693
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,919
somebody clicks a link somebody goes to

694
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,880
our url somebody opens an email and then

695
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
we're going to talk about process

696
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
discovery a little bit more in depth and

697
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
then we just have all of these now

698
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,520
notice we can't execute anything yet but

699
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
we're at least well on our way to

700
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
understanding how we can test against

701
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
this adversary and how what parts of

702
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,080
this that we can automate

703
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
and then

704
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,120
this is the final one which is the

705
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
procedures and so techniques and

706
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,440
procedures really go hand in hand uh

707
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
they of course have layers of

708
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,120
abstraction because you can have

709
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,200
multiple procedures that map to a single

710
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
technique and this is that next step in

711
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,840
understanding can i automate this

712
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,679
procedure or is there a different one

713
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
that i can so and this is the case where

714
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,679
you can use proc dump

715
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,720
to dump lsas and that's just some syntax

716
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,960
there that you can run this command and

717
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
you will get an lsat on

718
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
now a lot of questions come when you're

719
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
operationalizing attack or trying to

720
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
figure out how do i what are those

721
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
procedures like how do i make that map

722
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
if you go into mitre attack you'll get

723
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,039
mixed reviews

724
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
procedures are listed for a lot of

725
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,240
things but sometimes it talks about this

726
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
adversary uses a specific piece of

727
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,799
malware and that's all it'll say and so

728
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,480
now you have to go and figure out like

729
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
maybe you don't have reverse engineering

730
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
or you have to go and figure out

731
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,880
somebody that says

732
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
this piece of malware does something

733
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
this way because you remember human

734
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
operators are still driving that malware

735
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,279
right

736
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,720
and so

737
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
a tool that was meant to sort of address

738
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
this problem was red canary's atomic red

739
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
team project it's a great project it's

740
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
sort of how people get started when

741
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
they're looking at mitre attack and they

742
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,279
want to execute it within their

743
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,640
environment

744
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,880
now a quick disclaimer about it

745
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
it's a great place to start but it is

746
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
not complete it is a community driven

747
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,360
project and it is really really good uh

748
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
if you're interested in getting started

749
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
with it they've got a really like i said

750
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
really welcoming community you can

751
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
easily contribute it's it's something i

752
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
always recommend people go and check out

753
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,080
and see uh see some of what the

754
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
community has built out around it

755
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,559
but it has sort of become a check box

756
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,320
exercise as i mentioned before mitre

757
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,919
attack has become something that

758
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,159
everyone wants that check box at the

759
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,120
technique level but we still have to go

760
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
with procedures and

761
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
testing of individual techniques is

762
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
great for checking your logs

763
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,799
but

764
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
adversaries never execute a single

765
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
technique not in a vacuum they tend to

766
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,159
execute them as a chain and so this is

767
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
where atomic red team tests come from

768
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,159
unit testing or atomic unit testing in

769
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,840
software engineering that's meant to

770
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
test a very specific thing

771
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
and so that's where it comes from it's

772
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
really good for for attacking or getting

773
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
started but once you're trying to

774
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,559
automate or emulate

775
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
adversaries it sort of falls short

776
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,000
uh let's see the last thing here is that

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,679
the sort of secret with attack is i've

778
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
shown you a really clear example of

779
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,559
going through a tactic a technique and a

780
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,039
procedure but almost every single

781
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,360
procedure requires two attack techniques

782
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
in order to work

783
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,960
and so that's not always clear

784
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
so let's talk about process discovery

785
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
one of our

786
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
this was in the discovery

787
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
tactic process discovery's the technique

788
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
running task list on command line is one

789
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
way of doing it here's the thing command

790
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,039
line is its own technique this is where

791
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,960
i said before you typically have a goal

792
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
that you want to achieve and then you

793
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
have an execution method to achieve it

794
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,880
but those are two different miter attack

795
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
techniques

796
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
now there's other ways though to achieve

797
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
this too and we're we're talking about

798
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
adaptive adversaries they want to

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
achieve the same goal oftentimes they

800
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,360
want to understand what are the

801
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
processes that are running they're not

802
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
going to invent new ways to do it but

803
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
they might look for ways that might not

804
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
be either logged or alerted on and so

805
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,520
that's where there's a bunch of

806
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
different ways to do this we have

807
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
windows command line we have powershell

808
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,159
we have wimmick or wmi is all different

809
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
ways all three of these commands give

810
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,919
you the same info in different ways

811
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,679
now there are atomic red team tests for

812
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,600
all three of these and that's great

813
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
because you can either use the command

814
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,360
line or powershell in order to execute

815
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,080
them

816
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
however there's another way

817
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,679
that is the windows api now api calls

818
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,240
are something that are not well uh

819
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,880
detected on right now most edrs actually

820
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
fail to detect these types of things

821
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
that's got some history behind it some

822
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,200
of it is because uh

823
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
with if you're intercepting api calls

824
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
you can see basically everything that's

825
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,799
going on within the system it's hard to

826
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
say uh you're you're basically saying i

827
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
need to moder literally everything

828
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,320
happening on the system for the greater

829
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
good of security and so that was a

830
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,520
privacy concern when people were first

831
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
looking at it with edrs and they said no

832
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
we don't want that level of

833
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
introspection we don't need it

834
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
but more and more adversaries can do

835
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,120
this every single one of these is listed

836
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
as a miter attack procedure which means

837
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
that real adversaries have used these

838
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,880
exact commands in these in this case

839
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,640
this exact function

840
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,559
in real compromises

841
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,640
and the reason that the native api

842
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
doesn't work with atomic red team is

843
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
because it requires more than just

844
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,200
running this it's a function you have to

845
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,880
write a program that's going to call it

846
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,000
directly

847
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
and so that's not something that's

848
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,360
necessarily easy to do but it is

849
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
something that you still need to be able

850
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,039
to test against

851
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
so that's some of the challenge with

852
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,039
atomic red team is that you're not

853
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,600
necessarily going to have something for

854
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
each of those

855
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,279
tests you're going to have to figure out

856
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,039
all right what are these different

857
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,600
processes that we can use in the case of

858
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,559
this one persistence it's a long uh

859
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,960
a long scheduled task creation and so

860
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,760
that's the the granular level you have

861
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
here is what you can use to figure out

862
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,480
whether you can swap things out

863
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,039
deliberately in order to emulate

864
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,080
specific adversaries and so that's where

865
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,480
as you build this out you're potentially

866
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
going to use

867
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
other tools and other cyber threat

868
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,039
intelligence in order to figure out

869
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,399
these if you don't want to do it

870
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,120
yourself there are some resources that

871
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,240
we have here mitre has miter ingenuity

872
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
they have their center for threat

873
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
informed defense is what they call it

874
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,279
and so they have blogs they have a

875
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
github that has all of their emulation

876
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
plans they also have the attack

877
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
evaluations which actually walks through

878
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
of all of the different edr vendors they

879
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,039
have like it's like 20 or 30 of them at

880
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,720
this point that they run through these

881
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,559
tests and they do these comparisons so

882
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,919
that you can see

883
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
what are the specific techniques what

884
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
are the procedures that these edr's are

885
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
able to detect or are not able to detect

886
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
now scythe we also have something called

887
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
threat thursdays we release these uh

888
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
once a month and uh and the idea is that

889
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
they are open to everyone in the

890
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,600
community mitre has much more detailed

891
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
plans i gotta give them credit like

892
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
that's the gold standard for it but it

893
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,799
takes them eight to twelve months to

894
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
release these things because they do a

895
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,399
ton of work with them

896
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,559
so i'd recommend checking those out

897
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,919
same thing with cyber threat

898
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,720
intelligence reporting the d4 report is

899
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
another one i like to give a shout out

900
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
to they cover a lot of ransomware

901
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,559
engagements and they really go down to

902
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
the procedure level and so that's

903
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,840
something when you are looking at cyber

904
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
threat intel that allows you to build

905
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,080
out this type of

906
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,559
this sort of level of

907
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,559
test that you're going to need because

908
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,760
otherwise you're going to be filling in

909
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,120
the stories with holes yourself

910
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,480
so just wrapping up here i think the the

911
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,679
key thing that i really want to get

912
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
across beyond just giving you some of

913
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,760
the ways to think about things as well

914
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,320
as some techniques to do that is that

915
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,559
automating techniques and capabilities

916
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,720
is just as important as researching new

917
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,200
techniques this is something that

918
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
i think in in information security it's

919
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
really easy to get swept up in all the

920
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,039
cool new cves people come out with

921
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
but there is a lot of really good

922
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,760
research that's done

923
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,159
that needs to be built into a tool built

924
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
into a product and that will overall be

925
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,480
something that helps the greater

926
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
community and so that's something that i

927
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,840
just want to highlight and sort of call

928
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
out to everyone that's doing that thank

929
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,559
you

930
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,399
because i don't think

931
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,200
people get enough credit

932
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,080
all right so wrapping it up here's for

933
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,159
uh since i'm the last talk i've got a

934
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,240
couple you know if people have questions

935
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,159
happy to stick around

936
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,799
otherwise you can catch me afterward or

937
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
around

938
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,039
[Applause]

939
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,399
thank you very much

940
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,880
cool questions comments question um

941
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
this whole

942
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
lecture

943
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
seems to be telling me that we're

944
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,840
talking about evolution on the red team

945
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,880
side

946
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,120
that we're going from like what we would

947
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
call a pilot in an aircraft

948
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,919
to just an operator sitting at a

949
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
terminal like the old teletype operators

950
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,000
is that

951
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,799
the true

952
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
so the question was around let's try to

953
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,440
paraphrase that is the

954
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
is around

955
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
are are we

956
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
is this sort of a paradigm shift from

957
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
having a specific

958
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,720
like expert that is driving everything

959
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,039
versus someone that's that people that

960
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,440
are doing things sort of

961
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,080
let's see more more remote like scaled

962
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
out

963
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
uh and i think i think the answer for a

964
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,960
lot of it is yes i mean i i think from a

965
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,159
red team

966
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
uh red team perspective that area has

967
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,799
sort of shifted even over the past three

968
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,600
to five years uh red teams used to do

969
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
basically a lot of the things that i

970
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
just talked about up here

971
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
but they are increasingly being asked to

972
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,679
get around edrs and those types of

973
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
things and so they have to dive deeper

974
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,159
and deeper and deeper into understanding

975
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,320
how those things work

976
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,559
and and i think that's something that

977
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,440
has required a level of expertise that

978
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,480
continues to go up and so

979
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,919
not quite sure if i'm answering your

980
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
question here on this but i think we we

981
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,320
are seeing a shift in the types of

982
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,159
expertise

983
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,159
that is required of red teams and it's

984
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,560
also meaning that you have tools that

985
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
are sort of back filling what they used

986
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,520
to do

987
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,800
because there's such a need for testing

988
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
across technology right

989
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,119
even five ten years ago you had a lot of

990
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,440
businesses weren't quite forced yet to

991
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
use too much technology in their

992
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,040
day-to-day but i mean we've seen

993
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,119
ransomware uh actors hit um hair salons

994
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,599
as well as of course you know fortune 50

995
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,800
companies and so from that uh standpoint

996
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
uh you probably are not going to have a

997
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
red team come and do a test for a hair

998
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,560
salon right um

999
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
you know that they they just aren't

1000
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,679
going to be able to afford necessarily

1001
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,359
that level of expert and that i think is

1002
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,440
actually the majority of companies

1003
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
won't necessarily be able to afford a

1004
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
red team to come in and do something

1005
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,359
so

1006
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,240
all right yeah

1007
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
well your question

1008
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,839
yeah

1009
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,320
um so i was just thinking about the

1010
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
concepts of blackboard it's called a

1011
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,040
small security team

1012
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
the guy who um security

1013
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,079
and just thinking

1014
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,560
how important is it for people to be

1015
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,920
able to test your environment

1016
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,118
to me it seems

1017
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,640
they're upset because we're going to be

1018
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,960
pulling back on their 30 at short fleet

1019
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,119
so the question was around uh whether

1020
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
you should have people internally that

1021
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:01,920
are

1022
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,599
uh attacking your own infrastructure

1023
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,920
providing the red team uh and my answer

1024
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,839
to that is yes i would call it a purple

1025
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,480
team though um and and to address part

1026
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
of what you mentioned is that animosity

1027
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,119
sometimes between teams

1028
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,440
sometimes when it comes to red teaming

1029
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,119
and penetration testing there's a

1030
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
win-lose mentality and that's something

1031
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
that

1032
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,760
tends to

1033
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,240
tends to drive tensions high right and

1034
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
so when it comes to purple teaming it's

1035
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,280
sort of taking one of those specific

1036
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,880
things so i'll jump back in my slides

1037
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
here uh so let's pick take this page for

1038
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,720
example

1039
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
you can anything that you can

1040
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
link to mitre attack you can say this

1041
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
this has been used by a real adversary

1042
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,000
that's how they scope down attack is

1043
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,480
that they want to make sure that only

1044
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,760
things that have been used by real

1045
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,359
adversaries and that goes back to what i

1046
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,040
was saying about not every technique

1047
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,440
matters and uh because if you're just

1048
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,760
following red team researchers on

1049
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,599
twitter like they're brilliant people

1050
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,200
but they're releasing new stuff like

1051
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,520
every couple hours essentially where if

1052
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
you went to your one of your teams like

1053
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,960
your sock for instance and you were like

1054
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
we're going to test task lists and then

1055
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,079
we're going to test this and we're going

1056
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
to test this and see you could be

1057
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
transparent about it everybody wins

1058
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
regardless and i think when it comes to

1059
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,960
talking and building relationships with

1060
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
other teams right that is something that

1061
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,440
takes a lot of time and being able to

1062
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
try and make the rest of your processes

1063
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
more efficient to allow for that sort of

1064
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
human interaction team building time is

1065
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,560
important i think that's where you know

1066
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
the short answer to your question is yes

1067
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,880
you should do more things internally if

1068
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,200
you can but as you mentioned teams are

1069
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
stressed these days from so many

1070
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
different things they're asked to do and

1071
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,800
so that's where if you have tools like

1072
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,079
some of the ones i mentioned from like

1073
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
the c2 matrix and other things like that

1074
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
caldera is another automation tool that

1075
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,839
is open source and free uh those are the

1076
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,520
things that you can do that hopefully to

1077
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,720
help you free up time and provide you uh

1078
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,320
sort of a quicker way to address some of

1079
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
those things but yeah i mean that's a

1080
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,480
tough problem but i also think that's a

1081
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
super common problem right now across

1082
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
teams and you know that's where

1083
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
red teams are i think being asked more

1084
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
and more to try and be more

1085
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,280
collaborative to try and help uh help

1086
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,119
build bridges within organizations

1087
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
because of some of those

1088
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,119
okay good

1089
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,480
yeah another question um

1090
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
so yeah the question comment was uh was

1091
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
that skeptical that

1092
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,160
that companies that hire red teams to

1093
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,960
bypass edr leverage that and i would

1094
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,839
agree i think

1095
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,240
the the understanding of what it takes

1096
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
and also that's the type of thing like

1097
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,880
red teams are are full of experts that's

1098
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
a lot of people don't like see sort of

1099
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,560
behind the curtain of all the things it

1100
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,240
takes for red teams to do these days to

1101
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
be successful i would say the money

1102
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,400
would be better spent making sure edr is

1103
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,240
running everything because they probably

1104
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,560
got it

1105
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,680
yes and and to repeat the question for

1106
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,800
everyone is uh is that making sure money

1107
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,480
is better spent with with more

1108
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
collaborative efforts like making sure

1109
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,320
edr is running everywhere that it's

1110
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
tuned those types of things and i think

1111
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,560
yes we're seeing more of an embrace of

1112
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,599
those types of uh approaches in

1113
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,480
organizations and that because the

1114
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
organizations that really do benefit

1115
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
from a red team that have you know that

1116
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
that can bring in that expertise is a

1117
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,359
very small subset realistically and so

1118
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,680
trying to make sure that there is sort

1119
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
of a broader more collaborative nature

1120
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,599
around security can help address some of

1121
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,440
these problems that i know a lot of

1122
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,960
organizations and i've been in several

1123
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
that have

1124
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,599
had teams that are butting heads

1125
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,960
constantly

1126
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,440
because of actually past incidents

1127
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,920
between teams and so there's that sort

1128
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
of history within the organization that

1129
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,760
makes it really difficult to

1130
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,640
yeah achieve anything so yeah good good

1131
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,879
point

1132
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,800
all right i've got three things here

1133
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,319
first question uh goes to you here

1134
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,760
and then i have two more uh

1135
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,800
backdoors and breeches

1136
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,560
all right

1137
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,680
oh all right who doesn't have one

1138
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,440
there we go all right come on down

1139
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,280
what's that

1140
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,680
ah that's all right

1141
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,119
you gotta get your prize can't be shy

1142
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,640
for prize

1143
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
one more

1144
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,119
let me just throw it all right all right

1145
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
you ready all right i'll underhand it

1146
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
we'll see how this goes

1147
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
oh

1148
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,760
it's all right that's right luckily i'm

1149
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,000
in cyber security not athletics

1150
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,280
anything else

1151
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
cool

1152
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,118
thanks everyone thanks again
