00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
um so the the first comment i got on

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,920
this was this is exclusionary uh so i

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
want to preface i'm in no way saying

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
this is exclusive to guys i don't know

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
if that needs to be said but guy rhymes

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,200
with hi and i thought that sounded good

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
the other thing i want to say is that

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,960
during this presentation i'm going to

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
make a lot of comments about people that

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,559
come from non-traditional backgrounds

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,840
the value they bring i in no way want to

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
portray that

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
coming from a traditional background in

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
this field is any less valid any less

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,840
needed it is very very crucial and it's

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
how we've gotten to where we are

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,799
what i want to present today is just a

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
new thought

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,479
so

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,040
about me uh i don't usually like to talk

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,320
about myself

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
but i think it's important for me to say

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920
a fair bit about myself so that you

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
understand why i'm so passionate about

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,400
this

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
um a little bit of

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,439
me as a person uh my my beautiful wife

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
sarah she could not come with me she has

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
the first things that comes up

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
i want to release this field i got some

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,959
credentials

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,480

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
don't i think they're they're fine

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
they've definitely helped me get to

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
where i am at this point because as

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,239
you'll see i have a degree in crisis

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,120
counseling i have a lot of non-infosec

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,280
related history

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
starting from the bottom i was a dorm

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,000
mom for a period which meant that i had

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
a

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
house of 16 international students 15 of

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,959
them from china one from south korea and

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,200
my role was to make sure whenever they

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
got home on the bus

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,680
in the afternoon i was already there

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
we would get them all their stuff put

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
away if they had chores to do i had to

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
make sure they did their chores i

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,080
started

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
cleaning the house before they got home

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
i cooked their dinner we had some time

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,760
group time to discuss

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
uh what the day looked like what do they

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
have problems with their homework all of

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,239
that and then

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
we had like a game time at night

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,239
and then i made sure they were in bed by

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
the right time and someone came and

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
uh took over for me so

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
i did that for a while i was a truck

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
driver for the longest time i said that

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
i had more truck driving and moving

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
experience than i had infosec experience

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
for a good several years because

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,319
throughout college and after i worked as

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
a truck driver for a moving company

105
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
several moving companies

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
i hate moving like i'm sure many of you

107
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
do i will put my numbers against yours

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
any day i have done more moves

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
um

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,680
it's it's not a life that i

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
would wish upon anybody but i give a lot

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,959
of credit to anybody that has come from

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,200
that and i will tell you that that has

114
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
been one of the driving forces in my

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
work ethic

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
i was a logistics coordinator for a

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,799
company called tough mudder so

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
it's a 10 mile obstacle course

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
we would

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,840
go to a site i actually did one

121
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,160
um i think it was in just south of south

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
of nashville

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
a couple years ago and

124
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
i would go there and make sure that the

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
site was set up

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
i worked with djs vendors etc and then

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
made sure all the participants had a

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
good time so i was responsible for

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,639
coordinating a lot of that

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
and then the most interesting one that a

131
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
lot of people like to or that i think

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
has really helped me in this field is my

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
family counselor experience

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
i was a family preservation counselor in

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,919
the social welfare system i spent

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,280
several years

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,599
doing

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
foster care recommendations family

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,080
preservation counseling i would go into

140
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
a home when we got a recommendation from

141
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,759
the county if there was an issue in the

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,320
home that the child wasn't safe there

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
weren't appropriate boundaries then my

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
role was to assess the situation if i

145
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,759
could

146
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,039
help them build the boundaries help them

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,960
build a safe foundation and if not i

148
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
made foster care recommendations and as

149
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,479
you can imagine it was very emotionally

150
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
draining

151
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
i had a a lot of

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
burnout in that period and it made me

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
re-evaluate what i wanted to do with my

154
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
the rest of my career

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,919
so

156
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
through some friends mutual mutual

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
friends family

158
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
this field was introduced to me and i

159
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
will tell you the beginning i had

160
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
no i.t experience i had to have my

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
friends help me download video games on

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
my computer because i couldn't figure it

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
out

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,199
so there was a steep steep learning

165
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
curve for me going from nothing to

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
learning this field

167
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,280
but what you might find more interesting

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
is my infosec history

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,240
i actually started off in cloud security

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
i was

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
learning more of the compliance side

172
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
than the it side i had learned the

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
basics of networking at this point

174
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
through a lot of self-study the basics

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,479
of

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
how an info or an organization might run

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
and i started in cloud security looking

178
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,759
at cloud service provider

179
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
self-assessments and reviewing them

180
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
against the cloud security matrix i

181
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,840
moved into a fortune 200 on their

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
security team doing identity and access

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
management

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
moved from there into internal audit

185
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
where i got into more

186
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
more compliance more stocks auditing and

187
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,240
understanding where does um

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
where does everything fit within the

189
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
larger scope of the business and then

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
went on to risk management within that

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
same organization

192
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
so there's a lot about me um i generally

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
don't share that much but i think it is

194
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,160
particularly relevant for this talk

195
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
um but about me now i'm a manager for a

196
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
cyber security cyber security firm

197
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,639
echelon risk in cyber we're based in the

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,759
pittsburgh area so i flew in yesterday i

199
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
got to spend some time here

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,120
we

201
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
we have three main

202
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,560
pillars of our organization three

203
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,759
service lines we have our offensive

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
security and testing where we get to

205
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,039
work with some of the most talented pen

206
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
testers i've i've come across

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
i'm constantly impressed with the new

208
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,759
ways that they're coming up with to uh

209
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
to fish our our clients to getting

210
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
privilege escalation they're they're

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
just incredible i get to do some of

212
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
those pen tests sometimes

213
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,000
the bulk of my time is on our audits

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
assessment and compliance side where i'm

215
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,720
performing risk assessments we work a

216
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
lot in the regulated space highly

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
regulated with gm

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
i can't

219
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
can't speak

220
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
glba um

221
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
hipaa i do a lot of cmmc business

222
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
continuity dr uh all the fun stuff and

223
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
then our defensive security engineers

224
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
are um helping with the the hands-on

225
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,280
making

226
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
defensive decisions and helping

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
organizations figure out

228
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
more of the traditional blue team side

229
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
then all of that gets wrapped up in our

230
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
vcso service where we help the

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
organizations develop a roadmap and we

232
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,479
help them reach their goals throughout

233
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,800
the year

234
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
so

235
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
the question that i i wanted to really

236
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,479
address before we even got started is

237
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,120
why does any of this matter

238
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
we have a lot of qualified people

239
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
already in the field we have a lot of

240
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
people that um

241
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
already know what they're doing

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
why should we consider people that are

243
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,440
coming from non-traditional backgrounds

244
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
one of the first things that came to

245
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
mind is the fact that there is

246
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
there's a lot but there's not enough in

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,039
infosec we are looking at

248
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
the depending on who you ask a several

249
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
million position deficit

250
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
the need is constantly growing in our

251
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
field and we're only projected to

252
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
continue growing

253
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
i think 20 28 percent uh by

254
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,760
2026

255
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
we're just going to continue growing

256
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
the rate that college graduates are

257
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
coming out right now with degrees that

258
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,440
are related to our field is not

259
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
sustainable for getting us into a place

260
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
where we have what we need to defend

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
our organizations

262
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,839
so i think this matters for a couple

263
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
reasons one that we have a lot of

264
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
applicants coming from non-traditional

265
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
backgrounds

266
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
we're going to i'm going to dive into

267
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
why i think that is

268
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
but

269
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
even right now i'm hiring for a couple

270
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,920
positions and i keep seeing more and

271
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
more people like me people that came

272
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
from something that wasn't traditionally

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,519
seen as

274
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
part of i.t or part of infosec

275
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
but when i think through and i look

276
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
through what their experience is i'm

277
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
seeing a lot of value and

278
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
elements of what they've been doing

279
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,720
but we're going to continue getting

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
these these applicants that are coming

281
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
from different backgrounds

282
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
another reason i think there's a ton of

283
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
great experience out there

284
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
we i mentioned some of what i've done

285
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
i'm going to share some stories later

286
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,839
about how

287
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
people have leveraged their experience

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
and made it valuable to the organization

289
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
and bolstered the their security posture

290
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
through it there's

291
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
great experience and

292
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,399
as i said we need good people

293
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
we need problem solvers we need critical

294
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
thinkers we need lifelong learners

295
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
because this is not a solely technical

296
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
field anymore

297
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
infosec is so interdisciplinary it's no

298
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
longer well we can just set up

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
firewalls and sim and things will be

300
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
fine it's we have to talk with risk we

301
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
have to talk with compliance we have to

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
talk with communications we have to talk

303
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
with

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
finance there

305
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
it is touching every aspect of the

306
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
organization now and we need to have an

307
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
interdisciplinary mindset whenever we're

308
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,800
looking at it

309
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,560
so i put together this this agenda this

310
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
is basically what we're gonna go through

311
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
i didn't think this jacket was gonna

312
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,399
last long and it's not

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
this is what i'd like to cover with you

314
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
guys today if you'll uh

315
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
if you're you're here for the ride why

316
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
are people switching careers i think

317
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
there's some

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,279
some uh

319
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
good reason i think infosec is

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
particularly appealing whenever

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
people look at something else to do

322
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
we'll talk about that

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
people are quitting jobs at an alarming

324
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,279
rate right now

325
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,320
um

326
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
we keep hearing this great resignation

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
there's a lot of people that are leaving

328
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
their roles and like i said the scope of

329
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
cyber security continues to grow it's

330
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
it's no longer just the the little silo

331
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
we're touching everything

332
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
i also wanted to talk today about

333
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,399
what can people with these

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,040
non-traditional backgrounds offer

335
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
what should we be looking for with them

336
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
while we're interviewing while we're

337
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
we're talking to colleagues what are the

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
qualities we should be looking for

339
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
and then how do we support people

340
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
industry transplants as i like to call

341
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
them how do we support them and best

342
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
leverage them when they are in the

343
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,320
organization out of curiosity a show of

344
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
hands how many of you came from what you

345
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
would deem a non-traditional background

346
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
it's a fair amount

347
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
i love that that i feel camaraderie with

348
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,519
all of you because i think that you you

349
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,360
know that there's a

350
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
you might relate with my steep learning

351
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
curve and you might relate with some of

352
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
my struggles the imposter syndrome which

353
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,920
i don't think that's

354
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
solely people coming from different

355
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,880
fields i think we all feel a level of

356
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,399
imposter syndrome

357
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
but it it really sets in for me

358
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,959
because i traditionally i came from a

359
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,518
non-i.t background

360
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
so

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
to get started why are we getting these

362
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
applicants

363
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
well

364
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,279
there's a couple reasons i think

365
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,800
you know you talk to a sociologist and

366
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,279
they may disagree but what i think

367
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
we are seeing unprecedented career

368
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
transition

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,399
uh it's not just our field it's in a lot

370
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
of fields

371
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
i think the copa pandemic was a very

372
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
clear

373
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,440
catalyst

374
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,000
we we start seeing our employees that

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
are expecting remote work we start

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
seeing a lot of the world once from our

377
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
work because we've seen that it works

378
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,839
and there's now this struggle that

379
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,240
organizations are going through

380
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
trying to go back into the office

381
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
because as we said there's two 2.7

382
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
million roles in this field that are

383
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,079
unfulfilled if you're trying to push

384
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
somebody to go in the office

385
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
there's 2.7 million other roles they

386
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
could go try to fill

387
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
so organizations are just facing this

388
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
cultural

389
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
cultural divide

390
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
what is the right move for us but from

391
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
the

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,680
side of being the employee i mean

393
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
remote work is nice for a lot of us some

394
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
people really love it some people they

395
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
prefer to be in the office but we've

396
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
kind of lost the integration

397
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,279
the

398
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
what's the right word the division

399
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
between home and work life we have this

400
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
integration where

401
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
you know a good example is my day i

402
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,440
might start at 7 and work until 11 and

403
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
then grab something to eat and work out

404
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
and run an errand and then start back at

405
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
one and work until 3 30 and then

406
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
i start i do another errand i have to do

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
and i get dinner started and then i jump

408
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
out going at seven and i work until nine

409
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
or ten and

410
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
there's this loss of

411
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,519
uh the the division or the the

412
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,399
separation of work and home life which

413
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
i think there's good and bad to that um

414
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
i think i see there's some

415
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
some concerns because it makes it very

416
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
hard to have a balanced life but i think

417
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,839
there's a lot of good because it does

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
allow us to

419
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,600
have flexible work schedules and live a

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
life and do what we need to do

421
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,880
um so i think the copen pandemic it

422
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,959
highlighted a lot of that

423
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,720
and it made it almost the expectation

424
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
now another reason is societal changes

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,639
like i said we have this great

426
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
resignation

427
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,120
people are leaving not only other

428
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
industries they're leaving our industry

429
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
for another role because

430
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
right now it's it's hard to get a raise

431
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
or a salary compensation modification

432
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,959
unless you go to another company

433
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,399
which is just the truth right now i

434
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
think i have seen some organizations

435
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,160
that are trying to combat that but it's

436
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,959
tough

437
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,279
um so i think societal change is where

438
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
we're kind of expecting now

439
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,240
that

440
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
people might be leaving we had this four

441
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,399
and a half million

442
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,040
people quit their roles in november of

443
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
2021

444
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
not our field just in general

445
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,839
and that's a record number that's the

446
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
most in the last 20 years

447
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,519
we have not seen numbers of people

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
quitting like that

449
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
part of that i also think is the

450
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:28,880
the

451
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
level of

452
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
emphasis put upon degrees

453
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
the federal bank did a study to see how

454
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
many people were actually using the

455
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
degree for which they went to school and

456
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,639
they found that 27 are which means

457
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
that's awesome for those 27 percent that

458
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
we have 73 percent of our labor force

459
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
that is not using the degree they want

460
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
to school for

461
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
and so you have people like me and you

462
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
have people like some of you that went

463
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
to school for teaching or you went to

464
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
school for finance and now you find

465
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,320
yourself here

466
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
so i think that's that's part of why

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
we're seeing people change is

468
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,759
we are

469
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,800
almost

470
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
innately

471
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
led to believe that our degrees right

472
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
now are not as valuable as we thought

473
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,759
they might be

474
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
and then we're seeing rollback of

475
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,959
requirements there are organizations

476
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,800
that are no longer even quiet requiring

477
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
a degree to get into this field which i

478
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
think is stellar i think there's great

479
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
experience out there that is being

480
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
ignored because we don't see

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
an associated degree

482
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
the rollback of some of these

483
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,079
requirements is a great move

484
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,519
so why do people choose this field what

485
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,720
is it about infosec that people are

486
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
enjoying and i think it's obviously

487
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
because it's the best job in the world

488
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,519
yeah i

489
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,120
i i um

490
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,480
this came up in a conversation a few

491
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
weeks ago in a team meeting somebody

492
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
googled best job in the world and sure

493
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
enough information security analysts

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
came up

495
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
so i i couldn't i couldn't not include

496
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
this

497
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,520
but i think there are some very real

498
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
things and i'm happy to tell you what

499
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,880
drew me to this field

500
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
the first one is the accessibility of

501
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,480
information

502
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,799
we have resources like youtube and

503
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
pluralsight and udemy and

504
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
a humble bundle and there's there's so

505
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,559
many ways for us to learn facets of this

506
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
field and

507
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,799
learn the basics of this field that

508
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
other other

509
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
fields don't really offer i would say

510
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,960
as an example

511
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,559
if i wanted to

512
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
advance in my career as a counselor my

513
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
next step was to get my masters i had to

514
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
get it in social work or counseling

515
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
something related and then i had to go

516
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,799
through internship and then i had to go

517
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
through licensure

518
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
and i went through all of that i put

519
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
myself in this i would go through this

520
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,880
immense amount of debt

521
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,600
to

522
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
have this degree that then i have to

523
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
fight to actually continue using um

524
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,120
because there's there's an abundance of

525
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,160
that role and then the other part is uh

526
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
the salary i mean

527
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,919
when i looked at what i

528
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,840
could potentially earn in that field

529
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
compared to what this field thankfully

530
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
does

531
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
offer in a lot of sense

532
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
it was almost a no-brainer for me if i

533
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
could start to learn and really push

534
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,000
myself

535
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
to

536
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
study from the youtube from youtube

537
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
watch the videos like uh

538
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
no homsek and and john hammond and uh

539
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,720
null cody kenzie and null bite i i grew

540
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,039
up or grew up in this field watching

541
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
those guys and learning from them and it

542
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
gave me so much

543
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
so much uh insight into what this field

544
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
really looks like

545
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
and what i can do in it

546
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
so i think the accessibility is to me

547
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
the biggest reason uh credentialing

548
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,919
it's so much

549
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,320
i hate to say easier but more cost

550
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,840
effective and

551
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
um uh

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
beneficial i would say

553
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,120
that's that's a little risky but

554
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
definitely more cost effective

555
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,160
to

556
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
work on certifications and work on

557
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
classes and work on courses in this

558
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
field rather than investing in another

559
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,880
degree

560
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
in in another field

561
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
that like i was saying i was coming from

562
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
the counseling side

563
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,120
it made more sense to me

564
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
that's exactly

565
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,760
it

566
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,679
it's so much more time effective i could

567
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,480
spend three months studying for my ceh

568
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,120
and pass that when i could spend three

569
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
months in a semester getting my master's

570
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,320
and

571
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,880
in social work and get through one one

572
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,120
semester right

573
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,880
and so i think the credentialing is a

574
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
massive part there's just a lot of

575
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,480
opportunity in our field for people to

576
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
show that they know

577
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,799
they know what they know without having

578
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,520
to bring in additional work

579
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
that said i think there's a lot of value

580
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,320
to

581
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
masters and future education further

582
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,720
education doctorates whatever may be

583
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
additional degrees in this field but i

584
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
think there absolutely is ways for you

585
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,520
to move in it without those additional

586
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,080
credentials

587
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
the perceived stability was another one

588
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,159
for me everywhere i i knew nothing about

589
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,159
cyber security but

590
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
man i heard about it on the news and now

591
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,159
being in this field you know you hear

592
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,919
ransomware attacks every other day you

593
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,960
hear um this this hack happened and

594
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
we're in the public eye all the time

595
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
everybody's hearing about the field so

596
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,720
there's this perceived stability in the

597
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
in this projected growth

598
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
that we are expected to as i said

599
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
continue growing

600
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,480
and those are real draws for somebody

601
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,400
that's at a precipice of what do i want

602
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,440
to do for the rest of my life

603
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
we also talked about how

604
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
interdisciplinary this field is

605
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,559
this a lot of people that i've talked

606
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,360
with

607
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
have done associated work they've worked

608
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
with the business they've been a part of

609
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,960
the business

610
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,559
and they

611
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,880
have worked with i.t in their cyber

612
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
security infosec in some capacity in

613
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,840
compliance and now they want to do it

614
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
because they found it

615
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
cool that's the last one it does sound

616
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
cool everybody you watch mr robot or you

617
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
you watch one of those the movies where

618
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
there's a hacker sitting in a keyboard i

619
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,280
don't know if you guys have ever seen i

620
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
think it's csi where there's the two

621
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
hackers one keyboard video like it's

622
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
ridiculous but it looks cool so

623
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
i think that's one definitely one of the

624
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,200
things and then finally the breadth of

625
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
options this gets updated every couple

626
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,080
years it's from henry zhang

627
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
over at diligent and every couple years

628
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
he does these cyber security domains and

629
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
each time it just gets bigger and bigger

630
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
and i get more excited when i see these

631
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
because

632
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
there's so much room to grow how can i

633
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,640
get bored when there's so much room for

634
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
for us to grow in

635
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
here get all excited when i see it

636
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
and the nice thing is that we as infosec

637
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,679
um professionals we're not pigeonholed

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,520
to any of this we can't be pigeonholed

639
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
to any of this because we have to be

640
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
interdisciplinary we have to be thinking

641
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,439
about multiple levels of this

642
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
so i think those are some of the the

643
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
main reasons why people really want to

644
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,440
come to this field

645
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,799
and then

646
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
the other side of the the coin is well

647
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
what can these candidates offer

648
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
because we have traditionally hired from

649
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,039
the the the normal background you know

650
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,200
you come up in a computer science degree

651
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
or you come up in maybe even a cyber

652
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,679
security degree now

653
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,120
we we have these candidates we've

654
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
traditionally going been going to but i

655
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,039
think that there is something that

656
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
non-traditional

657
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
applicants can provide so

658
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,640
the three that i i came up with um were

659
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,000
perspective

660
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,919
that's the easy one everybody says well

661
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,360
they have a unique perspective well what

662
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
does that mean

663
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
i'm we're going to jump into that i

664
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,679
think they provide a cultural impact

665
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
we so frequently talk about well is this

666
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,919
person going to fit the culture i think

667
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,280
we need to be asking is this person

668
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
going to improve the culture

669
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
culture right now especially when we're

670
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
doing so much remote work when we're

671
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,840
doing so much that we can't be face to

672
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
face the culture is going to be what

673
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
keeps a lot of our people

674
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
interested and relevant in the field so

675
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
finding people that bolster your culture

676
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
they don't just fit but they make it

677
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
better i think is key

678
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
and then i want to talk through the

679
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
qualities

680
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,520
that people i think people will bring

681
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,760
from non-traditional backgrounds

682
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
my disclaimer on that of course

683
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
everybody's going to bring something

684
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,799
different based on what they were doing

685
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,760
before

686
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
it's a no-brainer but i think there are

687
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,880
a few key qualities that almost all of

688
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
them will have because it takes these to

689
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
get into it

690
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
so we'll start with perspective

691
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
uh

692
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
i like this

693
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
this uh meme because the new guy as um i

694
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
was abusing it in this

695
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
is anybody a new candidate they they

696
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,279
have a perspective of what does the end

697
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
user think of this what does the

698
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
business think of this

699
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,720
what does the project manager think of

700
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
this coming from

701
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,320
something unrelated seemingly unrelated

702
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
brings so much perspective into where

703
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,360
our

704
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,480
team fits into the whole organization

705
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
so i i like to think that the new guy

706
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,159
has all of these and i started making

707
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,640
with like legal and compliance and and

708
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
all these different things and i thought

709
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
i'm just getting ridiculous now but you

710
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
get the idea the

711
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,039
the

712
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
individual coming from a non-traditional

713
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
background is going to have the

714
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,120
perspective of another part of the

715
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,279
organization with which we're working

716
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,400
and that could be

717
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
the the end user and

718
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
why is this person still clicking on

719
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
phishing emails they've gone through the

720
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,799
training so many times and they're still

721
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,320
clicking on it

722
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,120
well

723
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
a lot of times the uh somebody coming

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
from a non-traditional background is

725
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,360
gonna say well i was that person and

726
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
here's what i thought i didn't care

727
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
about security because you never really

728
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
made it seem like a threat to me

729
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,760
um some organizations do i have not

730
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
worked with many that do

731
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,559
but

732
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,840
yeah i mean they they bring this

733
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,480
perspective they bring the this um

734
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
the business idea i i'm sure you guys

735
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,919
have seen it

736
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,840
i've saw it in former roles i see with

737
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
clients that i work with now i'd see

738
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,080
versus the business and how we're we're

739
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
siloed and it's almost like we're

740
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,159
combating each other i think they bring

741
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,600
verbiage and mindset that can help us

742
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,360
change the way that we're speaking with

743
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
the business and show the value of what

744
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,960
we're going to provide and why we need

745
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
to do this

746
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,440
one of my i think my greatest skill sets

747
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
in this field has been my conflict

748
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,600
de-escalation from counseling and the

749
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,400
ability to gain trust easily with people

750
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
because how i've approached my

751
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,760
conversations with clients my

752
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
conversations with

753
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
people that may not be part of

754
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,120
infosec is here's why this matters to

755
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,320
you i understand you don't want to do

756
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
this i understand that this dr plan

757
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
seems stupid to you but let me show you

758
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
what you're doing by preparing for this

759
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,039
and when i can

760
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,520
position it as we are working together

761
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,039
rather than we are working apart from

762
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
each other it's been really one of my

763
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,799
greatest assets and has made some of the

764
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,919
biggest

765
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
changes in how i work with people

766
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,600
so i think people that come from a

767
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,720
non-traditional background are going to

768
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
bring this perspective i like the if the

769
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,960
only tool you have is a hammer it's

770
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
tempting to treat everything as if it

771
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
were a nail and that's what i think in a

772
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
lot of senses we we have done is we have

773
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,600
brought traditional means to true

774
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
traditional problems and now we have

775
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
emerging problems and we're still trying

776
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
to apply traditional

777
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,559
fixes to emerging problems

778
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
having somebody come from another

779
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
perspective is going to give us

780
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,440
opportunities to look at this from a

781
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
different side like i said we i want to

782
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,679
find the problem solvers i want to find

783
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
the critical thinkers

784
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
we we just can't be so

785
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
limited to the idea that

786
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,720
there's one way

787
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
so then we talk a bit about cultural

788
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,279
impact

789
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,120
of course the culture is going to be

790
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
defined partially by the perspective

791
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
i just mentioned the different ways to

792
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,279
approach a problem i think

793
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,720
somebody that comes from another field

794
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,640
is going to bring new ways to look at

795
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,159
the problem

796
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
they're going to help us find spots

797
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
where the

798
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,720
we're going to be able to need to find

799
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,279
spots where the perspective

800
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,120
the prospect can benefit the team

801
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
it's hard whenever we

802
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
know that we need we have a need but we

803
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
can't figure out quite how to fill it

804
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,960
and

805
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
a lot of those positions a lot of those

806
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
needs i think are going to be able to be

807
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
filled by non-traditional people i've

808
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,720
got a cool infographic

809
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,159
i can't say it's an infographic it's

810
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,720
just a picture uh it's it's a and it's

811
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
in a couple slides but you'll get what i

812
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
mean whenever i get there

813
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,039
there's the learning culture so one of

814
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,720
the things that i noticed whenever i

815
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,159
moved into

816
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,200
the this

817
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,360
corporation i was talking about is that

818
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,159
i had been learning non-stop

819
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
since i got into the field i had been

820
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
going

821
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
to different i'd been buying courses i

822
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,559
had been saving money from my nine to

823
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
five while i was working nine to five so

824
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
that i could afford more courses i had

825
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,559
this level of um i needed a

826
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,640
self-investment because i wanted to show

827
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
that this is mine

828
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
somebody that comes in is going to

829
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,520
expect to continue learning and so when

830
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,360
i went into this organization i thought

831
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
i'm going to be among these peers in

832
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,679
infosec and these guys like the cyber

833
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,120
security analyst they're going to teach

834
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
me everything and i'm just so excited to

835
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,039
learn from them and then i got in and i

836
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,240
saw

837
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
there's it's more of the mentality of

838
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,480
well i started the help desk and then

839
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
this position opened here and i don't i

840
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
don't really mind it but

841
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,360
it just kind of is what it is and for me

842
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
that was so discouraging because i

843
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
thought everybody in this field was

844
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,159
going to be super excited and i thought

845
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,200
everybody was going to be like

846
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,039
knowledge hungry

847
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
so what i noticed and what has been

848
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,600
brought to my attention from my my

849
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,799
superiors at the time and some

850
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
colleagues is that i

851
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,600
brought in the change i started asking

852
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
do you have an interest in this for me

853
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
what drew me was wi-fi hacking and i was

854
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
like do you have any interest in hacking

855
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
wi-fi i think it's like the coolest

856
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,440
thing and so i started studying it and i

857
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
started studying for the oswp and i

858
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,279
asked some friends do you have any

859
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,320
interest in colleagues do you have any

860
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,000
interest in studying with me

861
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,919
and they nobody had really posed that

862
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,159
question like why should i bother

863
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
advancing or learning more when it's not

864
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,960
a requirement um

865
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,159
and that was just kind of mind-blowing

866
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,520
to me

867
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
so

868
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,880
i ended up knocking the oswp not yet

869
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
it's going to happen but

870
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
what we did find is that some of them

871
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
found other interests in the field when

872
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,279
they started studying for the security

873
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,640
plus and they started for studying for

874
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
ceh

875
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
but it took a catalyst to make that

876
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,720
happen so i think you somebody coming

877
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,919
from another field is going to bring

878
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,320
that that hunger to learn more

879
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,200
and then i think they're going to bring

880
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
new methods they're going to bring tools

881
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
and tactics

882
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,600
one of my

883
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
my favorite examples of that is when i

884
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
was an internal audit i was testing

885
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,279
terminated users manually and getting

886
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,760
really frustrated how slow it was and we

887
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,159
had hired a new guy

888
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,960
and he came from manufacturing another

889
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,559
form of manufacturing

890
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
but he was not on the infosec side at

891
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
first he was on the supply chain side

892
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,120
so

893
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,279
he had a spreadsheet that was just a

894
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,159
vlookup that he had customized to find

895
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,520
only specific

896
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
specific parts but it ended up being

897
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
perfect for what i was doing and it was

898
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
something that i had i had never even

899
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,679
considered but this guy that came from a

900
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,640
totally

901
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,039
unrelated role was giving me like the

902
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,000
most

903
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,120
valuable tool in my arsenal at the time

904
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
and i was really excited about that i

905
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,399
think it's a great example of

906
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
how the types of tools and the tactics

907
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
that somebody might bring

908
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
they're going to bring good habits

909
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
whatever has made them successful in

910
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
other fields i think they're going to

911
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,960
bring with them whether it's their time

912
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,760
management their project management

913
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,960
how they interact with other people

914
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
they're going to bring their good habits

915
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,559
the flip side of that is going to bring

916
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,440
their bad habits uh that can be

917
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,960
and that can be a learning point that

918
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
can be a point of growth and i think

919
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
that's why as we're learning to support

920
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
people that come from non-traditional

921
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,919
backgrounds

922
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
we need to keep that in mind is that

923
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,880
while there is a lot of benefit

924
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,559
the unfortunate reality is not everybody

925
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,399
is a gem um

926
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
so we're we're going to talk a bit about

927
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
what to look for but i think something

928
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,279
that almost everybody will have in this

929
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
field

930
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,480
coming from a non-traditional background

931
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
there are a few qualities

932
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,039
i think they're going to have

933
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,679
perseverance because they have already

934
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,480
got rejections from other places they

935
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,559
have been told why are you making this

936
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,519
secu this change you don't really come

937
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,279
from that field their friends and family

938
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,000
likely have tried to discourage them

939
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,799
so they're going to have to have

940
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,760
perseverance they're going to have to

941
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,240
have discipline to repeatedly dedicate

942
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,919
their time after work while they're

943
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,640
working their own nine to fives

944
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
they're going to have to find time to

945
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,240
manage that and it's it's discipline

946
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,120
they're going to have a level of

947
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
self-investment

948
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
like i said the the sacrifice of their

949
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
own time their own resources i i paid

950
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,679
for all of my

951
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,320
uh courses i paid for all of my

952
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
certifications out of pocket because i

953
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
knew this is something that i wanted

954
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,720
if you've seen uh the rock did a verse

955
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,200
last year with uh with i think it was

956
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
with tech nine and it became a big meme

957
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,039
and he goes it's about drive it's about

958
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,360
power and everybody saw it i remember it

959
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,799
was all over the internet and i couldn't

960
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,919
help but put uh put him next to drive

961
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,720
but

962
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,840
they're to have a drive they're going to

963
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,399
have to continually motivate themself

964
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,720
intrinsically because there's not always

965
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
an extrinsic

966
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,960
um motivator and in a lot of cases there

967
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
is a deterrent

968
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,159
and then finally they have to have

969
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,640
humility which is what i think most of

970
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
us have anyway in this field because you

971
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,480
talk to other people and you're like

972
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,159
i've been doing this for 30 years and

973
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,080
they know way more than i do

974
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,279
this is the most

975
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,640
i think one of the most humbling fields

976
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,799
you can get into because we saw that map

977
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,360
of the breadth of things we talked about

978
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,919
there's just so much to learn um so

979
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,039
they're gonna have that humility and

980
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,559
they're gonna have that understanding

981
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,640
that it's okay they don't know anything

982
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,000
um

983
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,039
they're gonna be encouraged to keep

984
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,039
learning

985
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,320
so

986
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,760
while we're talking with

987
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,360
people prospects that might be

988
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
interested in coming to an organization

989
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
a couple things i think we need to ask

990
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
ourselves and we need to ask them

991
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
uh what what drew them to the field

992
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,360
for me like i said it was wi-fi hacking

993
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
i thought that if i could figure out how

994
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
to hack wi-fi and have wi-fi anywhere i

995
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
was that was

996
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,039
the coolest thing now

997
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,039
i'm not going to incriminate myself but

998
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,399
i did learn i learned a lot

999
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,760
but what drew them to the field why are

1000
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,918
they interested in it i think you will

1001
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,599
be able to tell a lot about a person if

1002
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,480
they tell you what their passions are

1003
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,159
what experience do they have outside of

1004
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,119
work

1005
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,239
and that doesn't mean it has to be an

1006
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,480
internship or formal experience but do

1007
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
they have a raspberry pi setup at home

1008
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
you know have they done any type of home

1009
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,239
lab have they um done a like a raspberry

1010
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,800
pi cluster maybe i that was one of my my

1011
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,960
first projects was building a raspberry

1012
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
pi cloud cluster and i was so proud of

1013
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
myself even though i didn't understand

1014
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,199
the code i just copied something off of

1015
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,000
uh

1016
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
off of github but

1017
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,520
i made it work and that was worth its

1018
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,599
weight in gold to me

1019
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
so i think talking when we're asking

1020
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
people about their experience

1021
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
ask them what do they do outside to

1022
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,239
continue improving their abilities

1023
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,639
the evidence of personal investment

1024
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,200
they said what what have you done to

1025
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,880
grow

1026
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
in a more traditional sense so what

1027
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,440
courses have you taken what um special

1028
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,359
interest groups are you a part of

1029
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,599
are you are you going to isoca chapter

1030
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,240
meetings are you going to your local

1031
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
b-sides conventions what are you doing

1032
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,839
to stay involved with the community

1033
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,800
and then ask them what sets them apart

1034
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
i if you were to ask me what sets me

1035
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
apart from other people i would say my

1036
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
conflict de-escalation my ability to

1037
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
build trust

1038
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,720
and my ability to hear people it's at

1039
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,160
this point i have told enough people

1040
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
that that that is where i feel i stand

1041
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
out but i think anybody that's going to

1042
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,640
try to make this transition is going to

1043
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,240
have something that they say sets them

1044
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,480
apart so i would i would pose to you ask

1045
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,839
them about it and ask them why they

1046
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,480
think it sets them apart

1047
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,599
some of the questions we need to ask

1048
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,839
ourselves is how do we commute how do

1049
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,920
they communicate

1050
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
we need people that are articulate

1051
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
we need people that can flesh out their

1052
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,760
thoughts and that's one of the value i

1053
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
think that comes from non-traditional

1054
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
backgrounds because a lot of them are

1055
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,320
something like a journalist or a teacher

1056
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
ways where

1057
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,599
careers where you need to

1058
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,040
express yourself

1059
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,320
in written form or orally

1060
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,079
we should take stock of how they're

1061
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,359
communicating and then how are they

1062
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,440
going to affect the culture

1063
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,880
are they going to be a hindrance are

1064
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
they going to be a value add to the the

1065
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,240
culture that you have

1066
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
so talking about how do we support and

1067
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
utilize these this is the picture i was

1068
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
talking about

1069
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,520
from the movie 300 the idea that

1070
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
we have these gaps

1071
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
we're always going to have gaps in our

1072
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
architecture and our organizations and

1073
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,400
our culture

1074
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,520
but

1075
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,280
one of the ways i think we can fill that

1076
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
in fill gaps we don't even know is with

1077
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,560
people with different different views

1078
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,280
because they're going to fill maybe that

1079
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,040
that report writing

1080
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,160
or the

1081
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,079
the needs of the business

1082
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,920
we're going to build to make each other

1083
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
better

1084
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
what i don't want to come across is that

1085
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
we need to accommodate everything to

1086
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,760
people because

1087
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,920
they don't have experience they don't

1088
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,839
have i.t experience we don't need to

1089
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,480
cater to people we need to strategically

1090
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,640
fill gaps with who we have and who we're

1091
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
gaining rather than

1092
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,560
hiring people and then trying to

1093
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
accommodate

1094
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,280
so

1095
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
as i was going through this i thought

1096
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,280
well it might seem like i'm saying

1097
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,119
you know cater their needs and i'm

1098
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,200
really not i'm i want to get across that

1099
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,240
um

1100
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,560
it's not so much catering it's just

1101
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,839
using them in the right getting the

1102
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,480
right people in the right seats but some

1103
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,560
ways that you can encourage their

1104
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,720
support them is by encouraging them we

1105
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,000
talk about imposter syndrome a bit

1106
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
it was one of my biggest struggles

1107
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,920
coming in is that i knew

1108
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
i learned

1109
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,320
quickly that i did know what i was

1110
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
talking about but as soon as somebody

1111
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,760
would question me about it i thought

1112
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,520
well this person has 10 more years

1113
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
experience i must not know what i'm

1114
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,240
talking about

1115
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,560
just encourage them validate them talk

1116
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
let them know you know we're all

1117
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,800
struggling in some sense

1118
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,160
play to their strengths you know if

1119
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,599
their strength is report writing if

1120
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,520
their strength is communicating if their

1121
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,680
strength is uh being creative put them

1122
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,119
in positions that

1123
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,599
let them do those things

1124
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,760
give them opportunities to learn

1125
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,440
if you're moving from another field into

1126
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
this field you have to be an avid

1127
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
learner and just continue to give them

1128
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,079
those opportunities because they're

1129
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,280
already used to it they already have

1130
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,680
been doing the work for it

1131
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,920
and then be honest with your feedback

1132
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,040
and constructive with your feedback

1133
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
i i did have

1134
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,359
people in my career that

1135
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,079
i would say inflated my ability more

1136
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,520
than what i

1137
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,160
what i actually was capable of doing and

1138
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,320
there were times when i did i feel maybe

1139
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
i failed a task because i wasn't quite

1140
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,440
ready

1141
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
be honest let them know i don't think

1142
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,280
you're ready for this let them know

1143
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
maybe this isn't the right fit but we're

1144
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,160
going to find you the right fit because

1145
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,800
we do have this need elsewhere

1146
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,560
but be constructive and show them this

1147
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,680
is how we're going to do it

1148
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,599
we are running low on time i'm going to

1149
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,920
give you just a couple examples um of

1150
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,599
some people that i i was as i was

1151
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,880
thinking through

1152
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,520
like oh who can i who can i call or who

1153
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
can i ask about their specific

1154
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,760
experience i realized i knew several

1155
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
right off the top of my head because

1156
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,119
i have worked with other people that

1157
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,960
have made these transplants or been

1158
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
these transplants

1159
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
the first one that came to mind is a

1160
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
friend when i went to get my first

1161
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
certification i was the holistic

1162
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,480
information security practitioner and i

1163
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
went to seattle to take a course and i

1164
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,400
met a couple people there that i had

1165
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,839
never met before and one of them was

1166
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,119
similar to me

1167
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,880
and that he was coming from something he

1168
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
deemed totally unrelated but he had

1169
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,599
gotten

1170
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,400
this

1171
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
security role in

1172
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,079
physical security

1173
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,560
and he was like ross i really don't feel

1174
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
qualified because i worked in a prison

1175
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,599
for

1176
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,079
eight years i was at the um he was at

1177
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,359
the the

1178
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
the local prison and he started off as a

1179
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,119
prison guard

1180
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
i don't really know what i'm doing but

1181
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,400
somebody after he grew in in his uh his

1182
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
knowledge of that specific prison and

1183
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
then he became a program director where

1184
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,359
he became a trainer then a program

1185
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,400
director

1186
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
and

1187
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
somebody approached him and said i think

1188
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,839
that your

1189
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,599
knowledge of physical security the

1190
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,520
things that you need to protect the

1191
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
assets you're protecting the physical

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,599
infrastructure you're protecting could

1193
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,119
be really valuable in this field and

1194
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,079
they

1195
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,839
they poached him they convinced him to

1196
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,760
try it and we sat there taking this

1197
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,839
course together thinking neither of us

1198
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,960
should be here because we don't know

1199
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,599
what we're talking about

1200
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,000
and he and i were two of the only three

1201
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,520
to um to pass that course first round

1202
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,319
oddly enough the other one it was a

1203
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,640
she was a bicycle patrol officer at a

1204
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
physical security company

1205
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,160
she started

1206
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
very

1207
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
early in her career just being being

1208
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
first responder being an emt

1209
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
um on this campus

1210
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,800
and grew grew in a role grew to be again

1211
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
another program director after doing the

1212
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
training portion but didn't see how any

1213
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,319
of that related to infosec until

1214
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,000
somebody said

1215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
i think that your knowledge of the

1216
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
physical security elements you've been

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
doing could be really effective here so

1218
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,880
she came to this as well not really

1219
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
thinking that uh she was gonna pass and

1220
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,240
then all three of us passed and it was

1221
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,520
awesome

1222
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,319
um another one i have a friend that

1223
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,359
uh he owned a daycare he and his family

1224
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,960
owned a daycare center

1225
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,160
and he

1226
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,839
similar to uh what i was talking about

1227
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,599
with my hot sauce company he knows the

1228
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,280
ins and outs of running a business and

1229
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,960
those have been some of his greatest

1230
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
strengths now he's a soccer analyst he's

1231
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,560
leading a sock team because he pays

1232
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
attention to detail he has to because he

1233
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,440
he manages the books he manages

1234
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,680
everything for his

1235
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,160
daycare center

1236
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
his entrepreneurial spirit and his

1237
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
ability to

1238
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,200
delegate his ability to pay attention to

1239
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
the small details those are things that

1240
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
make him successful now as a sock

1241
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,920
analyst so

1242
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
i think what i want to get across is

1243
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
that

1244
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
we are looking for specific qualities

1245
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,720
right there are certain things that make

1246
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,160
that will make somebody successful in

1247
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,319
this field and i think a lot of those we

1248
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,720
can and we need to continue finding

1249
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,359
and non-traditional backgrounds

1250
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,200
there's there's a need for well-rounded

1251
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,720
information security professionals we

1252
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,400
have this deficit it's going to continue

1253
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,440
growing

1254
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,319
the range of cyber services

1255
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,440
are just exploding we we everyone was so

1256
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,200
excited to move to the cloud and that

1257
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,480
was the big thing for a while is

1258
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,680
everyone's moving their architecture the

1259
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
cloud but then you had other cloud

1260
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,280
service providers that would then assess

1261
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,000
the cloud and now that's a new new realm

1262
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
and now you have assessors that are

1263
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,760
assessing the assessors of the first

1264
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,839
cloud you know how compliant are they

1265
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,240
and we just continue to go down these

1266
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,000
these rabbit holes and

1267
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,119
they're needed they're needed from a

1268
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,480
compliance standpoint from a security

1269
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,359
standpoint but it just grows and we need

1270
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,240
people that are willing to do the work

1271
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,000
that have the personalities to get this

1272
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,359
done and

1273
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,640
we're not going to fill that with

1274
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,720
traditional backgrounds

1275
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,240
i think candidates with non-traditional

1276
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,359
backgrounds

1277
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,480
i don't know how many more times i can

1278
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,640
say it there's a lot of value they bring

1279
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,240
their knowledge their experience their

1280
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,079
personalities can really make a change

1281
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
to your

1282
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,599
your culture

1283
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,880
and when you're going to talk to these

1284
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,720
people just make sure you're looking for

1285
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,040
the right candidate ask questions beyond

1286
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
technical to find out how they got here

1287
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,720
ask them why they're interested in the

1288
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,400
field and look for someone that's going

1289
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,440
to improve your culture not just

1290
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,839
fit in

1291
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,119
there were a lot of things there

1292
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,319
and i touched a lot of topics does

1293
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,200
anybody have questions

1294
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,319
no everybody's hungry

1295
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
um

1296
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,720
i'm a hiring manager

1297
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,560
for an identity and access management

1298
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,400
team okay

1299
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,119
we have had a lot of challenges finding

1300
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,920
someone in that sphere that domain right

1301
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,319
and i have found that some of the

1302
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,560
candidates that had come into me

1303
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,319
were better

1304
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,079
from outside

1305
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,319
right

1306
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,280
but everyone that a recruiting company

1307
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,079
is bringing to me is always a cyber

1308
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,000
analyst or they've been something else

1309
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,280
right how do you

1310
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,000
find those people what methodologies are

1311
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,319
you using an echelon or in your past

1312
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,760
life

1313
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,520
since recruiters have not quite gotten

1314
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,800
on board with that what avenues are you

1315
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,119
using to find those people that fit

1316
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,920
those non-traditional entries

1317
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,680
yeah that's a great question

1318
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,640
i think

1319
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
for a lot of what i've seen it's been

1320
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,359
the

1321
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,560
person looking has found the job um

1322
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,280
to your point the recruiters are not

1323
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,119
looking in the right places

1324
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,640
i have a

1325
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,119
i just read a really cool article about

1326
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,880
how hiring managers specifically can

1327
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,960
start looking so i would love to get you

1328
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
that article i can't

1329
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,000
i can't tell you specifically what

1330
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,760
website it's on but i'll get it to you

1331
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,839
but i think

1332
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,119
um my recommendation is talking to who

1333
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,040
you already have on the team and telling

1334
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,319
them this is something that we're

1335
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,760
looking for and that somebody doesn't

1336
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,440
specifically has to have to come from

1337
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,000
this background to thrive in it i

1338
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,920
i'm very particular and i know many

1339
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,119
people are very particular about who

1340
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,040
they'll put their name out if you can

1341
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,560
find somebody on your team that you

1342
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,079
trust and they have somebody that they

1343
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,680
trust then it's worth having the

1344
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,200
conversation um in a more entry-level

1345
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,760
iam position i think a lot of that and i

1346
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,040
can tell you from experience a lot of

1347
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,880
that can be taught to

1348
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,160
anybody you don't really need

1349
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,760
specifically a

1350
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,560
computer degree to thrive in that field

1351
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,480
because that's how i started uh was was

1352
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,640
an iam and i thrived out of that so

1353
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,680
finding somebody with the right

1354
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
personality is going to be massive i

1355
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,800
would say

1356
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,160
start with with the employees you

1357
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,480
already have and talk to them see if

1358
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,920
they have people in their

1359
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
colleagues they've worked with in other

1360
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,160
roles that might be a good fit

1361
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,400
um

1362
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,839
with your previous lines of

1363
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,119
study yeah so the question was do i

1364
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,040
think there was anything that i in the

1365
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,800
field that i wouldn't have understood if

1366
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,040
i had not gone through my previous study

1367
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,640
uh absolutely i think

1368
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
for example when i first looked up wi-fi

1369
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,000
hacking

1370
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,720
i i saw this video from cody kenzie at

1371
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,920
uh cody kinsey at um nullbyte about

1372
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,680
aircrack i said all right well so what's

1373
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,839
aircrack and i'm on a windows machine

1374
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,599
googling aircrack how do i install

1375
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,560
aircrack which doesn't work um i i

1376
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,319
learned what is uh

1377
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,319
i have to use this thing called a linux

1378
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,160
distro what is a distro and what is

1379
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,839
linux so

1380
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,520
you know those basic questions were

1381
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,359
things that started to come out of

1382
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,960
necessity of me searching but they also

1383
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,920
came out of courses so i went through a

1384
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
python course through udemy and it was

1385
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,960
very basic like how do you just start

1386
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,560
and that gave me some very baseline

1387
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
understanding of if i'm going to work

1388
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,559
with the tool i can modify it a lot of

1389
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,079
times or i can develop my own tools and

1390
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,720
i can script out what i want to do

1391
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,359
i learned some basic networking when i

1392
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,319
was going through some courses from

1393
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,839
um

1394
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,440
oh there's a guy on youtube and i'm

1395
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,400
blanking on his name professor messer

1396
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,920
i learned a lot from professor messer

1397
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,520
when i just went through his network

1398
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,319
plus course so learning those basics of

1399
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,400
how infrastructure works how data is

1400
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,960
transmitted was massive and a very big

1401
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,280
deal for me so yeah i would say there

1402
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
it was definitely key that i learned

1403
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,319
those basics

1404
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,119
oh i'm sorry i misunderstood yeah so

1405
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,599
family family counseling background i

1406
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,520
think it it helped me understand the

1407
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,839
psychology of people in the organization

1408
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,400
i had more opportunities to practice

1409
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,119
counseling in my last role where i would

1410
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,559
sit with people that had just lost a

1411
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,800
family member or i would sit with people

1412
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,319
that were going through a divorce or

1413
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,960
something along those lines

1414
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,839
and it gave me an opportunity to

1415
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,359
practice what i had already been doing

1416
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,880
and build those relationships that are

1417
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,319
pretty crucial in any field but they

1418
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,079
especially are in this field when we are

1419
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
so

1420
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,000
process and

1421
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
results driven that we don't get a lot

1422
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,599
of opportunities to

1423
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,040
talk to people one-on-one and build

1424
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,720
those relationships so i would say

1425
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
that's that's one way that my

1426
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
counseling degree in specific or my

1427
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,480
counseling experience was able to help

1428
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,640
me

1429
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,880
yeah i also had a question kind of

1430
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,280
coming from the other side um so as

1431
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,800
somebody trying to get into the cyber

1432
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
security field from i would say pretty

1433
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
diverse background

1434
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
what would you what's the best way to

1435
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
convey

1436
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
like what you've done that's maybe not

1437
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
directly cyber security related like i

1438
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,920
have a pretty heavy networking

1439
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,040
background

1440
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,200
but i just i can't even get a call back

1441
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,800
personally yeah

1442
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,079
you guys need to connect um

1443
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,960
it's it's tough and i say that being a

1444
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
hiring hiring people now and going

1445
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,480
through applications

1446
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,800
there are a lot of good candidates and

1447
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,839
there are a lot of people that i want to

1448
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,319
give a shot but then there are

1449
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,000
other candidates that just are in the

1450
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,440
moment better suited for what i'm

1451
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,880
looking for

1452
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,680
i will say that

1453
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,280
specifically me i'm looking for somebody

1454
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,599
that is articulate somebody that can has

1455
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,760
a repo um

1456
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,720
has a background in something that's

1457
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
somewhat related so

1458
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,920
i do a lot of report writing i need

1459
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,000
somebody that can clearly convey their

1460
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,319
their thoughts so i'm i'm open to people

1461
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,160
that are coming from a highly regulated

1462
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,880
field like a finance or if somebody is

1463
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,960
coming from law i'm open to that

1464
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,079
for you coming trying to to portray that

1465
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,000
i would do as much as you can on your

1466
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,680
cover letter talk about

1467
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,520
the things that you're doing outside of

1468
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,319
your your experience so if you're doing

1469
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,000
any type of home lab or you're doing

1470
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,800
like i said a raspberry pi talk about

1471
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,559
groups that you're involved with talk

1472
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,640
about why you love the field

1473
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,520
and then

1474
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
just as a personal

1475
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,680
aside reach out to the person directly

1476
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,760
on linkedin shoot them a message

1477
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
people that shoot me a message on

1478
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,240
linkedin

1479
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,839
even if i don't have a position for them

1480
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:38,960
right now i'm going to talk to them

1481
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,599
because they want the extra effort they

1482
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,280
made themselves uncomfortable and did a

1483
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,920
cold reach out and i respect that

1484
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,240
so i would definitely say

1485
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,680
consider reaching out to them directly

1486
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,200
and then in your cover letter put as

1487
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,800
much as you can about why you like this

1488
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,160
field what you think you want to

1489
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,400
accomplish in it and try to convey the

1490
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,800
passion

1491
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,839
so i think in your slides you mentioned

1492
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,240
the emphasis you emphasize a lot on

1493
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,559
certifications one thing i just wanted

1494
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,880
to mention that there are certifications

1495
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,119
that are good but then just like with

1496
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,280
any other degree out there

1497
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,559
some certifications are just too

1498
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,599
expensive and too much for a beginner to

1499
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,319
start with yeah and some people

1500
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,960
there have been descriptions in you know

1501
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,640
recruitments out there which say you

1502
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
need to have this this certification

1503
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,319
which don't make sense for someone who's

1504
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,160
just beginning into the field

1505
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,000
a very good example being you need to

1506
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,119
have cisp to just join uh as an abstract

1507
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,880
engineer which is ridiculous out there

1508
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,559
you can't expect that no one even gives

1509
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,040
that certification for that matter um

1510
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,520
but at the same time i as a person who

1511
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,160
has been hiring actively for our company

1512
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,920
as well um

1513
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,520
it's it's actually something that i've

1514
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,880
been looking out for a different

1515
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,720
perspective we don't want the same

1516
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,880
school of thought in our team we want

1517
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,400
different schools of thought so that we

1518
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,160
have different perspectives coming in

1519
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,680
when we are you know reaching out to our

1520
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,839
clients and offering them solutions

1521
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,280
um one thing i wanted to mention for

1522
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
those who are in the non-traditional

1523
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,839
sense and trying to switch over a great

1524
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,319
way to reach out is through blogging

1525
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,079
or through just you know talking about

1526
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,599
what you're doing talking about your

1527
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,200
journey about trying to switch over to

1528
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,599
the field on social media i personally

1529
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,119
picked up some candidates from twitter

1530
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,119
because they were talking about this and

1531
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,680
it was just simple tweets maybe say i

1532
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,440
did this today i tried the story it

1533
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,960
showed that they were passionate about

1534
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,040
work and at least you can have a

1535
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,440
conversation see how it goes if it's the

1536
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,920
right fit in your company out there but

1537
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,079
it kind of introduces to people

1538
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,480
other people in the field out here who

1539
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,559
are working for that so that's just what

1540
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,240
i wanted to mention

1541
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,559
