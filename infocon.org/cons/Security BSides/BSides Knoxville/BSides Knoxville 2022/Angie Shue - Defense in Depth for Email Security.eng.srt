1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,840
all right so our next talk

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,799
uh angie shu is presenting defense

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
defense i misspelled it on my sheet

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,959
defense in depth for email security

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,930
good morning

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,920
[Music]

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
i just had a co-worker give me a good

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
luck fish as i'm talking about fishing

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,959
today so

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
i might hand that out later i'm not sure

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
but i really i like my new little fish

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
here

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,480
i'd like to set the stage for this

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
presentation with a quote from cisco

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,120
customers of all sizes face the same

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,719
daunting challenge

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,960
email is simultaneously the most

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
important business communication tool

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
and the leading attack vector for

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
security breaches

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
so

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
that kind of defines my job i'm supposed

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,760
to let through 100 of the good email and

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,080
stop 100 of the bad email

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
that's definitely a huge challenge and i

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,680
haven't perfected it yet but i will tell

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
you some of the things that were today

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,400
that we're doing to try to meet that

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,720
goal

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,840
a little bit about me i am a cyber

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
security engineer at team health i've

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
been working there for about a year and

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
a half

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
and prior to becoming a cyber security

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,960
engineer

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
i was a sys admin in a lot of different

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,720
companies doing a lot of different

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
things everything from

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
custom access databases accounting

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
software support

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
exchange admin active directory

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,720
router switches firewall rules so all

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
kinds of stuff a broad range of things

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,399
so this is the first job that i've had

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,960
where i've actually gotten to focus on

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
something so specifically

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
um a relatively small area of email

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
security so even though it's a

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
very big responsibility i'm really

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
enjoying being able to hone in and

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
become the sme on this topic

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
i do get to work from home which i love

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
that's a picture of my family there

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
those are my boys remington and magnum

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
they are great danes and our little mop

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,920
beretta and my very patient husband adam

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
i mentioned i work for team health so in

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
case you aren't familiar with that they

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
they do operate nationwide

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
and they are in very much in the

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
healthcare industry they do a lot of

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
different things they are expanding

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
their telehealth

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
service line right now

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,599
they

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
one of their primary things is helping

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
to supply doctors for hospitals

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
especially ers and they also do nursing

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,319
lots of lots of medical billing lots of

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,119
different things in health care

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,239
and being in the health care industry

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
you may or may not be aware that health

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
care is a target a specific target for

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
cyber criminals a big reason for that

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
medical record sells for a lot more on

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,879
the dark web than a social security

77
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
number or credit card number all of the

78
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,680
information in a medical record is very

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
valuable and it's it they go for a lot

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
more

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
and so we've got a lot of stuff that we

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
need to protect at team health and we

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
take it very seriously

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
a lot of personal identifiable

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,239
information phi

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
subject to lots hippo regulations that

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
we need to keep an eye on all that stuff

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
as well

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
so

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
as we are in health care and

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
and we have valuable information

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
we are a target and we see that in the

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
attacks that come against our network

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
and

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
of course via email

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
so i'm going to show you some examples

97
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
of emails that we've gotten in

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,200
this first one you can see how they

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,079
changed the from to look like it was

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
coming from a legitimate team health

101
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,519
source

102
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
we see these fake delivery failure

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
notices and lately i've been seeing a

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
lot of fake voicemail notifications

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,759
we've seen fake spam quarantine

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
notifications

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
and so there's there's a

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
lot of emails in that category

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,880
and the other one you can tell they even

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
grabbed our logo they're trying so hard

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
to make it look legit

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
they even capitalize team health

113
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
correctly

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
and that's actually one of the things

115
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,639
that my filters look for is whether or

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
not they have the correct capitalization

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
for team health so they actually check a

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
mark on that one unfortunately and this

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
one we did actually stop at a filter but

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
they they tried really hard they also

121
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
you can see that little black dough area

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
they addressed to the recipient by name

123
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
so they did everything they they could

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
to try to get someone to click that

125
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,039
malicious link

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
another couple examples we see a ton of

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
vip impersonation of course it's really

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
easy for just about any company to be

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,080
able to scrape the names of the most

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
important people from websites and

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
linkedin

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
so we have

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,039
we see lots of emails where they're

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
trying to get direct deposit information

135
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
accounts receivable lists

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,720
and

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
request gift card purchases on behalf of

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
the ceo

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
and then

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
another example there just something

141
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,840
just

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,320
what might seem like really innocent and

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
just social engineering attempt just

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
trying to open that line of conversation

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
what's your cell phone number so we see

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
lots of these sort of things we've even

147
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
seen links in emails

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
that are specific to

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
the recipient so we look at that

150
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
malicious link so we block that website

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
in the link

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
if they were to click on it they would

153
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
know exactly

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
who

155
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
that

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
who the person was that clicked because

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
of that very customized link

158
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
so i've talked a little bit about why

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
team health is a target and why

160
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
that company needs to take

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
their security very seriously i'm going

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
to talk through a couple of the email

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
security systems that we have and then

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
also other and other layers that we have

165
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,120
just in case those two systems miss a

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
bad email

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,120
so how is team health dealing with the

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
onslaught of malicious emails

169
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,599
one thing that they did was they hired

170
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,400
me

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,319
i think that was a great decision on

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,800
their part

173
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
i am the first person that they've had

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
on their secops team dedicated to email

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
security and

176
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
they one of these systems that i'm going

177
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
to talk about they were on boarding as i

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
was onboarding the company so that was

179
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
brand new to them and then the other

180
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
system that i'm going to talk about was

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,000
being admined by their exchange admin

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
and he didn't really have a lot of time

183
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,199
to to spend tweaking and tuning it so

184
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
this we've taken email security

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
to a whole another level in the last

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
year and a half

187
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
i am going to mention here we do still

188
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
have on-prem exchange at team health so

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
you'll hear me mention that and that's

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
been a cost decision for us um up to

191
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,280
this point and and i'll i'll point out

192
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,960
why that would be the case a little bit

193
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,319
later and i'm sure that 0365 is going to

194
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
be inevitable

195
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
for us but

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
right now we still have on-prem exchange

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
and that does limit some of the options

198
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
that we have in terms of email security

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
because so many

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
um of the email security systems now

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
especially in the

202
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,800
the

203
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
space that i'm going to talk when i talk

204
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,919
about armor blocks especially in that

205
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
space they want to talk directly to

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
o365 via apis and they're not really

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,479
built to even

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,159
be able to handle on-prem exchange

209
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
so the first system i'm going to i'm

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,319
going to talk about is the cisco secure

211
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,360
email cloud gateway this is its latest

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
name if you're familiar with cisco much

213
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,679
you will know they love to rename things

214
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
so this is just the latest name you may

215
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
have heard of it referred to as cisco

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,519
iron port there's still

217
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
they still refer to it as that in some

218
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
areas

219
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
esa which is email security appliance

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
ces which is cloud email security and

221
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
that's the term that i'm going to be

222
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
using to refer to it today

223
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
but this is its new official title is

224
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
cisco secure email cloud gateways

225
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
they've been doing a lot of rebranding

226
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
of their names this year with cisco

227
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,800
secure

228
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
um did anyone does anyone hear have they

229
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
have you ever managed one of these cisco

230
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
secure email gateways or work for a

231
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,040
company that has this as your seg

232
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
all right very cool

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
all right a couple um i'm not surprised

234
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,279
that it isn't a large number of people i

235
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
feel that it's a very good product but

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
it is so customizable that it can be

237
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
more complex to administer than a lot of

238
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
the other options so

239
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
i really like it i think it does a good

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
job but it definitely

241
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
if you're going to tune it right it it

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
takes a lot of time

243
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
what other

244
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,320
segs do people use in their companies

245
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
proof point mimecast

246
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
call out

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,480
what your company uses for that

248
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,399
i guess

249
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,720
okay

250
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
there are

251
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
there are lots of other

252
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
segs out there um i know proof point in

253
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
mimecast are a couple that i run into on

254
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,079
a regular basis um fortinet

255
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
is one um and a lot of them have

256
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
encrypted email

257
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
built in so that's that's part of how i

258
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
get to see those with that email coming

259
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
in secure email coming in from our

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
partner organizations

261
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,120
so i will talk through that the cisco

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
cs has a lot of different layers than

263
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,480
email has to get through before it can

264
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,600
be delivered through to on-prem exchange

265
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
so i'll talk first about sender

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
reputation you may have heard of cisco

267
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
talos which is cisco's threat

268
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
intelligence

269
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,880
division and they

270
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
are constantly looking to see what kind

271
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,560
of things are out there and there are a

272
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
few different places

273
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
in the the ces layers that get

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
information from talos on a regular

275
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
basis so the first of those is

276
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
definitely send a reputation and they

277
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
telos rates all of the mail server ips

278
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
out there that it sees on a scale of

279
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
negative 10 to 10

280
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,519
and then in the cisco setup you can

281
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,079
say what you want to do based on those

282
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
ratings for example

283
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
if an email

284
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,959
say a mail server is trying to send an

285
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
email and it scores negative five you

286
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,760
can have that in a bracket that says if

287
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
the reputation is that bad just block

288
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,639
the email just drop it don't even wanna

289
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
look at it nothing else if the

290
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
reputation's that bad just get rid of it

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
then you can specify another range say

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
negative two to negative five well

293
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
this might be a little bit on the edge

294
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
let's let's allow it but let's rate

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
limit it so if it does start sending a

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
ton of bad email that gives us time to

297
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
react and block it all together

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
so you can have different

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
you can define as many of those ranges

300
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,800
as you want with different rate limits

301
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
and then have your big block top like

302
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,839
okay so if it's above

303
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
a rating of five then we're just going

304
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
to let this in at our normal

305
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,320
normal speed our normal rate limiting

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
for the email that is allowed through

307
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,079
the sender reputation filters

308
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,519
that email gets tagged with other

309
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
information that it gets from talos

310
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
one of the things that it gets tagged

311
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
with is its geolocation

312
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,360
so where is that mail server located

313
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,160
another thing that happens in that first

314
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
stage is it evaluates the email

315
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
authentication records so by the time it

316
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,959
gets to the the next stage of message

317
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
filters that

318
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
message has already been tagged with

319
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
whether or not

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,959
it passed or failed

321
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
the those email authentication records

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,800
spf dkim and dmarc so if you're familiar

323
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,040
with those and getting those set up in

324
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
dns that's definitely something that is

325
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
checked on the way in

326
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
then we get to the admin defined message

327
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
filters this is actually part of the

328
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
process that you have to access the cli

329
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,079
for with ces

330
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,399
everything else is in the gui so if

331
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
you're really nerdy and like cli this is

332
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,440
a fun area to play in with this with ces

333
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,839
all of these messaged all of the message

334
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
filters are written in regex so that

335
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,320
stands for regular expression if you're

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
not uh familiar with that this is an

337
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
example of what one of those filters

338
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
looks like so basically it's it's an

339
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,760
if-then statement and you can specify a

340
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
ton of different parameters

341
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
um email comes in with a lot of

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
different headers you can check all of

343
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
those you can check the

344
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,199
location the geolocation which is what

345
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
this one does

346
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
um so for example we allow

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,079
we have a white list

348
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,600
of

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
mail server locations that we allow

350
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,839
email in from and everything else is

351
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,199
blocked by default so if you try to send

352
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
an email to us from a mail server in

353
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,279
russia it's just going to get dropped

354
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
the next filter that ces has is

355
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
anti-spam

356
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
most companies i think

357
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
that put together anti-spam it's it's

358
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,160
kind of their own proprietary way of

359
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
determining that but what cisco does

360
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
with their anti-spam filter is they

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,320
again give a rating to the potential

362
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
spamminess

363
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
of the email on a rating of one to one

364
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,680
hundred and then we can choose at what

365
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
level we're going how we're going to

366
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,279
treat those for example we can say that

367
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,800
anything with a score of 65 and above is

368
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,959
so spammy that we just want to drop it

369
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
we don't even want to deal with it

370
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
but then there might be a middle range

371
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
say 35 to 65 where we're going to mark

372
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
it as potential spam

373
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
and we can treat that differently

374
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
farther on down the pipeline which

375
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
currently today what's happening is that

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
that email then get delivered to

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
exchange but then automatically shunted

378
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,240
to the user's junk email folder so there

379
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
there's options there and you can tune

380
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,519
it based on what type of email you seem

381
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,759
to get in

382
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,600
then there's an antivirus

383
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
filter

384
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,759
which probably doesn't come as a

385
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
surprise to anybody ces has a couple

386
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
different options for that and at team

387
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
health we're actually using sophos for

388
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
that anti-spam layer

389
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,120
or the anti-virus layer and then cisco

390
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
amp

391
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,800
there's it's cisco's own advanced

392
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
malware protection and this deals

393
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,959
specifically with attachments

394
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
so if an attachment comes in

395
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
that cs feels

396
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
it needs to it needs some closer

397
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,600
scrutiny

398
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
ces can hold that email in quarantine

399
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,639
well it uploads that file for analysis

400
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,480
and that

401
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
that email just stays there until that

402
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
verdict comes back as to whether or not

403
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
it's safe to release

404
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,920
every once in a while amp

405
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
does miss one it doesn't happen very

406
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,040
often but sometimes amp lets an email

407
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
through and then later it figures out

408
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
that it made a mistake

409
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,839
there's a method that it has to talk to

410
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,759
our local our on-prem exchange that says

411
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
yo dude

412
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,880
that was an accident i didn't mean to do

413
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
that could you please delete that for me

414
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
and then let me know whether or not that

415
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,839
was successful so that's a really nice

416
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
feature called auto remediation that's

417
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,400
in ces luckily it doesn't get it wrong

418
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,599
very often we don't have to use that

419
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,319
very often but it's nice to have when

420
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
that does occur

421
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
so basically two layers of antivirus and

422
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
this is a second layer of anti-spam

423
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
this takes a look at all the email

424
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,160
that's made through this far and it can

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
categorize it

426
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,679
as three different

427
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
if it thinks it's gray mail it can

428
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
categorize it as marketing social media

429
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,440
or bulk and then this is yet another

430
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
place where because of these tags we can

431
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
treat them we can treat these emails

432
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,679
differently if we want to further on

433
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,480
down the pipeline

434
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
then we have the admin defined content

435
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,840
filters this also is extremely flexible

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,320
you can look at any characteristics of

437
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
an email that's made this far including

438
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
tags that it's received from other

439
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
layers and decide what you want to do

440
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
with it do you want to put a special

441
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
banner on it do you want to remove all

442
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
the links and attachments because it

443
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,199
might be kind of on the edge

444
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,760
do you want to send it to a quarantine

445
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
either permanently or it temporarily

446
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
until someone can take a look at it and

447
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,120
see whether or not it was actually legit

448
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
this is an example of a content filter

449
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
and you can see it it also is regex

450
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,559
spaced and the big difference is for the

451
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
message filters you do in the cli

452
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
for the content filters you do in the

453
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,640
gui

454
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
but that does also mean that with the

455
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,559
message filters being in the cli they're

456
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
a little bit more flexible you can do a

457
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,960
little bit more with not statements than

458
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
you can with content filters um

459
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
so there's there's a there's room for

460
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
both of those

461
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
specific reasons to use one or the other

462
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
but this is an example of a content

463
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
filter that we have

464
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
the last stop that a message has in ces

465
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
before it can be released to our on-prem

466
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,520
exchange is what cisco calls an outbreak

467
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
filter this is another area where talos

468
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,720
is constantly feeding information to ces

469
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,679
so if there might be something going on

470
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,960
with an email that has certain

471
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,600
characteristics

472
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
ces has the option at this point to hold

473
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
that email in quarantine

474
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,720
until it gets updated information from

475
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,400
talos so five minutes later it might get

476
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
information saying okay so we had we're

477
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
holding all email with this broad

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
criteria we found out that it only

479
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,440
affects email with this

480
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,559
smaller

481
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,960
criteria so you can let go everything

482
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,280
else that you had quarantined and just

483
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,160
keep iterating through that and to try

484
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
to determine whether or not that email

485
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
might be malicious based on the latest

486
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,039
breaking things that talos is seeing out

487
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
there

488
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
i have had the question before doesn't

489
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
anyone complain about all of the delays

490
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,559
that can happen at various stages with

491
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,520
your incoming email since ces does have

492
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
the option

493
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
in more than one place in the pipeline

494
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
to hold on to that email for further

495
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,720
analysis

496
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
i've been very fortunate in the year and

497
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,320
a half that i've been administering the

498
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,720
system i haven't gotten any complaints

499
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
related to that

500
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,520
team health is very security conscious

501
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
and there is a lot of support all the

502
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,120
way up to leadership

503
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,080
for

504
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
the initiatives that we have on the in

505
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
the realm of security

506
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,679
so

507
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,240
up to this point i haven't had anybody

508
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
notice anything being delayed that

509
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
they've um

510
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
felt the need to complain about

511
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,400
for any infra nerds out there this is a

512
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,240
a slide showing the infrastructure that

513
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,039
we have with ces with ces being in the

514
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,000
cloud and it's in

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,400
two it's split between two cisco data

516
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
centers so we've got six virtual esa's

517
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,960
split across the two data centers all in

518
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
one

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
virtual cluster

520
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,039
the esa part of ces is what does all of

521
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,440
the actual work so that's what processes

522
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
the email that's where all the

523
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
configuration takes place with being

524
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,760
able to look at evaluate all of those

525
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
get all that updated information from

526
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
talos

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,120
decide whether or not to send that email

528
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
through to exchange

529
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,840
and then we have the one virtual sma

530
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
which stands for security management

531
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,520
appliance there in the middle

532
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,559
that's the centralized management piece

533
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
so we that's for centralized reporting

534
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
centralized message log tracking

535
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,159
and that's also where all of the

536
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
quarantines are located so whether it's

537
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
a temporary

538
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,840
quarantine

539
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,080
from a layer in the process

540
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,200
or a quarantine just in case somebody

541
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
might want it again or a quarantine

542
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,480
where i manual review them for false

543
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,039
positives all of that gets stored on the

544
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,600
sma so there's one place to go to look

545
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,799
at all of that information

546
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,080
there are a couple mentions here of ews

547
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
api

548
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
that is the path that ces can use to

549
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
talk to exchange for the auto

550
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
remediation that i mentioned earlier so

551
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
for security reasons we have it going

552
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,679
through an aws web application firewall

553
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
and so it kind of it

554
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
kind of hairpins but that is two-way

555
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
communication so that exchange can talk

556
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
back to ces and say whether or not that

557
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
remediation worked in addition to auto

558
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,400
remediation that i mentioned we also

559
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
have the option to do manual remediation

560
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,799
so if an email got through maybe it was

561
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
just a social engineering attempt

562
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,240
um

563
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
and so there's there's no attachment

564
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,159
that ces might want to pull back but we

565
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,880
do want to get it out of user inboxes we

566
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
can go in and and do that search come up

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
with that list and request ces

568
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
do a manual remediation as well so

569
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,159
that's another way to try to keep bad

570
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,559
emails away from our end users

571
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,320
and we have to use that every once in a

572
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
while

573
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
another link here we've got b2b vpns

574
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
between both of the cisco data centers

575
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
and the team health data center

576
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,679
the traffic that goes over those is

577
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,360
syslog traffic

578
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,400
we have several logs that come down to a

579
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
local collector for our sim

580
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,279
and also

581
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,200
ldap traffic flows over that b2b vpn

582
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
ces

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
checks to make sure that a recipient is

584
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,840
valid before it will accept the email so

585
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
that's where all that traffic flows ces

586
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
is constantly talking to rad to see

587
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
whether or not the email addresses that

588
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
are being sent at it are valid or not

589
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,159
and then the last part is the tls

590
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,640
version 1.2

591
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,039
cisco does not give the

592
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,080
option to also use that b2b vpn for

593
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,840
email traffic so we and we require tls

594
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
version 1.2 so all of that email in

595
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
between ces and exchange

596
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,440
is encrypted so that's what that last

597
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,840
part is is just all the incoming and

598
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,639
outgoing email

599
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
i've done a heck of a lot of talking are

600
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
there any questions

601
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
up to this point anything about

602
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
ces or

603
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,000
how we have it configured

604
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,279
um i'm actually not 100 sure

605
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,039
i had some very smart people in the

606
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,960
organization put that part piece

607
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
together for me

608
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,360
all i know is it works

609
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,440
there's a route in ces that points to

610
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
an external ip address that's added to

611
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,799
exchange

612
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,720
and so yeah they for email delivery

613
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
ces

614
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
and exchange do talk directly

615
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,840
yep that smtp handoff

616
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
what's the footprint of team health that

617
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
you can do all the geo-ip blocking

618
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
is it just regional

619
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,159
team health is mainly us based

620
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,400
so that's definitely the most important

621
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,480
traffic that we allow

622
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
that we do get some email from other

623
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,279
places and we have some contractors in

624
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,640
india that do some work for us so that

625
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
is another country that has to be on the

626
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,679
allow list

627
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,559
and

628
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,520
i do have a long list of exceptions so

629
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,640
even microsoft email sometimes gets

630
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,440
sourced from europe even if it's for a

631
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,840
u.s company so there there definitely

632
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,919
are a list of exceptions to those blocks

633
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,320
just just in case we've we've got that

634
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,559
capability just in case the mail server

635
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,799
accidentally sends from somewhere that

636
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
we're blocking

637
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,039
any other questions

638
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,559
so is this only for

639
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,159
incoming email from outside the

640
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,880
organization or is

641
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,440
very good question

642
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,919
so the question was is ces only for

643
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
incoming email or does it also see

644
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
internal only email and outgoing email

645
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
i'll start with outgoing email all of

646
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
our outgoing email does also filter out

647
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,200
through ces

648
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,840
and so we have filters in place

649
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
just in case somebody internally were

650
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
accidentally trying to send out a

651
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,880
malicious

652
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
link or a virus we're going to catch

653
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
that on its way out

654
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
we also

655
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,159
have a limit on how many recipients our

656
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,240
people can send to because we're trying

657
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,559
to very hard to protect our ip address

658
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,480
we don't want to get blacklisted or

659
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,159
labeled as spammers

660
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,399
so that also is part of our outgoing

661
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
checks if you're trying if you have too

662
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,039
many recipients on your email

663
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,720
you get a message back

664
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
denied

665
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
try again a different way

666
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
for internal only email

667
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,679
that's actually an excellent question

668
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,399
that lays right in armor blocks so i'll

669
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
ces doesn't see internal only email

670
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,559
which is a really good reason for us to

671
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,919
have armor blocks which i'll talk about

672
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
next

673
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,840
we do uh we we do have dlp enabled on

674
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,880
ces and we don't have it

675
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
completely locked down we're not

676
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
blocking anything based on that but we

677
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
are forcing encryption

678
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,520
so if it sees a certain if it matches

679
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
certain filters

680
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,039
it will first check and make sure that

681
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,520
that is going to be sent via tls and if

682
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,919
it's not then it enforces envelope

683
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,919
encryption

684
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
any other questions

685
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,840
that's cool thanks for all the great

686
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,559
questions guys

687
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
now i'll talk about armor blocks as our

688
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
second layer and

689
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,440
armor blocks is

690
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
armor blocks doesn't even see the email

691
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
until after it hits our exchange server

692
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
but it talks to exchange

693
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,120
via the ews apis

694
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
and it can remediate very quickly within

695
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,080
a second or two so usually when it sees

696
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
an email that it deems as a threat

697
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
it can remediate that before a user even

698
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
sees it in them in their inbox which is

699
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,640
nice

700
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,399
and this

701
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,120
is a product that can see the internal

702
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,320
only email

703
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,919
so that is very cool for us it

704
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
definitely looks at all incoming email

705
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,320
anything that ces misses

706
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,440
it evaluates it to see if it's a threat

707
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
and it also can look at that internally

708
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
only email so that if we ever did have

709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,559
an email account compromise

710
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,240
armor blocks could alert us that

711
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
something was

712
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
not looking right so we could look at it

713
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
more closely

714
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,279
another big feature that we use armor

715
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,200
blocks for is what they call their abuse

716
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,480
mailbox

717
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
so when an email comes in we put a

718
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,000
banner on it and we tell our users if

719
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,880
this looks suspicious at all forward it

720
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,679
to report phishing at teamhealth.com and

721
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,360
that shows up the armor blocks abuse

722
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,200
mailbox where we can take a closer look

723
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
at it it actually helps us analyze that

724
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,000
email it gives us information about the

725
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,640
sender domain it can show a little

726
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
screenshot of what a link would look

727
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,840
like if we were to click on it and then

728
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,919
we can make the evaluation there as to

729
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,760
whether or not it's safe

730
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,360
market is safe

731
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,159
and

732
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,399
let the user know that or

733
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,480
mark it for delete

734
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,039
and it is possible there

735
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,279
the person who evaluates most of these

736
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,520
is our security analyst he has made a

737
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
mistake before he doesn't happen very

738
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
often he's awesome but for example if he

739
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
were to mark an email for delete and i

740
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,679
look at it later like that's actually a

741
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,440
company that we do business with we we

742
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,240
do need that email we can just

743
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
swap it back to mark as safe and armor

744
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,080
blocks moves all those emails back from

745
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,480
deleted items to the inbox so it's

746
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,159
really easy to change your mind if you

747
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,559
need to after you make that initial

748
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
evaluation of those

749
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,039
potentially malicious emails

750
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
we do get a lot of

751
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,519
reports to that mailbox that are

752
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,919
actually legitimate emails and some of

753
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,840
our end users are

754
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,519
hyper sensitive to that sort of thing

755
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,320
and

756
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
we don't mind at all i would way better

757
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,240
spend

758
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,559
five minutes looking at an email and

759
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,159
then being able to say no that's

760
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,000
actually okay that's safe to interact

761
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
with then have a user take a chance and

762
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,320
interact with an email that would be

763
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
potentially bad so no matter whether

764
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,760
it's it was a safe email or a bad email

765
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,320
we always thank the users for reporting

766
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,159
those because we want we want to see

767
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,519
those we want to know what's going on in

768
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,200
our environment

769
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,880
also

770
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
so say it was a bad email that somebody

771
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,720
reported armor blocks will tell us that

772
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,000
it matched on so many other emails that

773
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
looked exactly like that and when we set

774
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,080
it to mark as delete it deletes all of

775
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,039
them at once so it's not only deleting

776
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
the one email that was reported it's

777
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,279
deleting all the matching emails

778
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,799
they're

779
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,320
they're still working on that they're

780
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,279
doing some of that but they're they're

781
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,120
still building out that

782
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,000
but

783
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
right now you can get in there and see

784
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,159
if they forwarded an email and we have

785
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,840
had people that

786
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,159
decide to not afford it only to report

787
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,840
phishing but forward it to all of their

788
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,159
co-workers as well

789
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,600
just to get a wealth of input on the

790
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,039
situation

791
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,399
so

792
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,399
so we are able to see that in armor

793
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,479
blocks where all did that email end up

794
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
okay

795
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,519
all right i've got one more slide here

796
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,519
for infra nerds

797
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,840
what does armor blocks look like in our

798
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,440
environment

799
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,559
i referred before that we had

800
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,840
a kind of a

801
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,919
somewhat unique situation with exchange

802
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,919
we actually have two separate exchange

803
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,919
domains in our environment one is for

804
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,399
the admin side of team health and the

805
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,240
other is for the clinician side of team

806
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
health the clinician

807
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,720
number of mailboxes is way bigger but

808
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,519
way lower volume because they often have

809
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,120
their own personal email addresses that

810
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,360
they're using or the email addresses

811
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,039
assigned to them by the hospital that

812
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,600
they're working with

813
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,640
so

814
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,159
that's one of the reasons why it's

815
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,240
cheaper for us to stay on prem at this

816
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,279
point is because the clinician is so low

817
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,760
volume that it doesn't make sense to pay

818
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,640
for those mailboxes in o365 though like

819
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,559
i said before i'm sure we're going to be

820
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,279
heading there at some point armor blocks

821
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,360
doesn't currently have a way to look at

822
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,840
both of those exchange domains at once

823
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,159
so we have two separate

824
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,719
portals for armor blocks

825
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,760
so we

826
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
do all the administration all the

827
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,839
looking at it in the armor blocks cloud

828
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
in their portal

829
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,079
but on-prem we've got three node

830
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,119
kubernetes clusters that ac that stands

831
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,679
for armor blocks exchange connector so

832
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
those are virtual appliances that we

833
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,079
have on our vmware servers along with

834
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,839
load balance pair that talks directly to

835
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,960
exchange so that's what that looks like

836
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,839
we've got times two one in each of the

837
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,879
exchange environments

838
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
are there any questions about armor

839
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
blocks i kind of covered that a little

840
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
faster

841
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,839
armor blocks does some of that um

842
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,680
and one way that we've um

843
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,040
dealt with that as well is if ces

844
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
if it's not on a known list when it

845
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,200
comes to ces

846
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,280
our email banner shows that envelope

847
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,359
sender as well which outlook doesn't

848
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,320
natively show to give our users another

849
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,720
clue that that is not coming from team

850
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
health that's not coming from a known

851
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,079
address

852
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,800
so ces can do some of that armor blocks

853
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
can do some of that and then we also try

854
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,960
to give that information to the end user

855
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
as well

856
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,640
to help them out

857
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,480
oh

858
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,880
okay

859
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,280
all right so i do not know what just

860
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
happened to my powerpoint presentation

861
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,079
so the next thing i wanted to address

862
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,480
quickly though is why both why do we

863
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
have both of those couldn't one or the

864
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,839
other do a good enough job

865
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,119
and in my opinion i think they both have

866
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
a really good place in our environment

867
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,520
ces

868
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
while it's really good and it does get

869
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
up-to-date information tell us on a

870
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
regular basis it's still a seg it's

871
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,760
still a relatively static

872
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
rule-based product

873
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
but it can filter a ton of bad email

874
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
right off the top that then exchanges

875
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,200
armor blocks never have to deal with

876
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,079
they don't have to spend cycles on

877
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
some hundreds of thousands of emails

878
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
that ces just blocks

879
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
but

880
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,960
armor blocks has that advanced signal

881
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
analysis that they are constantly

882
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,960
developing and rolling out updates for

883
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
on a regular basis

884
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
in order to

885
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
be able to detect more zero days and

886
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,480
more things that we can't catch with the

887
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,040
static rules that we have in place on

888
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,079
ces

889
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,760
so i consider both of them to be

890
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,599
extremely important to our environment

891
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,000
let me see if i can get my powerpoint

892
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
back

893
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,480
and then just to show you some numbers

894
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
so that you can see what that looks like

895
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,359
okay

896
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,079
this is a report that i generate for our

897
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,400
leadership i actually generate

898
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,160
a weekly version of this for the cio

899
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,280
and then generate a monthly one that

900
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,920
my manager can show at the

901
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,119
the leadership team meetings

902
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,440
um so this this gives you some

903
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,920
indication of the volume of email that

904
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,440
we get to see so in the month of april

905
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,760
over 3.7 million emails were sent at us

906
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,480
ces decided that about 2 million of

907
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,240
those were probably clean and good

908
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,680
enough to let through

909
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,280
about 800 000 were spamming rated spam

910
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,480
and grain mail and then it blocked over

911
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
900 000 emails right off the bat that

912
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,200
never that

913
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,400
never had to be looked at by exchange

914
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
just stopped cold

915
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
up here that is armor blocks and the

916
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
threats that it caught

917
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,079
so that again it's advanced signal

918
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,800
analysis where it looks at every email

919
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,000
that flows through exchange inboxes to

920
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,359
try to figure out whether or not they're

921
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,640
bad

922
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,200
most of them it categorized as gray mail

923
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,560
but you can see during the month of

924
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
april it did also see

925
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,040
things that met its other policies

926
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,119
credential phishing payroll fraud social

927
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,200
engineering vip impersonation and

928
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,880
internal payment fraud so those are some

929
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
of the policies

930
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,960
that armor blocks has specific things

931
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
that it's looking for specific

932
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,720
indicators and signals that it's looking

933
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,960
for in emails

934
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,520
this down here is a report about the

935
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
abuse mailbox that i mentioned

936
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
so there's a there's a difference

937
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
between email and instance and i hope

938
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,280
you guys can see that better than i can

939
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
that that writing looks very faint but

940
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,280
the difference between emails and

941
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,040
incidents is an incident is one thing

942
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,880
that was caught

943
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,160
whereas emails is how many how many

944
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
things did it match in the environment

945
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
so there might have been

946
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,520
one incident of vip impersonation but

947
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,000
the sender sent in 12

948
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
of those bad emails so that counts as

949
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,079
one incident and 12 emails so that also

950
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,079
ties into this report to abuse we had

951
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,240
122 emails reported by our end users and

952
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,599
that matched over 31 000 emails that we

953
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,480
were then able to mark as either safe or

954
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,280
mark for delete

955
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
and you can see um between the two of

956
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,280
those at least the way we crunch the

957
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,680
numbers for this report the misses by

958
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,079
both scanners is half a percent

959
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,119
so it's we're looking at a very large

960
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,920
number of emails um and and that's a

961
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,760
pretty good percent but as i said you

962
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
know the goal is zero i want i want zero

963
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
misses and that's what i'm working

964
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,920
toward every day with filter tweaks

965
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
and then one other number i was going to

966
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,040
mention so the emails analyzed there for

967
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
armor blocks obviously that's much

968
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
bigger than the two million emails that

969
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,040
ces let in so that does include incoming

970
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,160
email outgoing email and internal only

971
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,800
email whereas the ces numbers only

972
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,240
include the incoming email

973
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,599
so what happens if both cisco and armor

974
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,960
blocks

975
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,359
miss the bad email they try really

976
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,960
really hard

977
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,079
but it still gets through

978
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,839
we have more cisco

979
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,599
um at team health we really like cisco

980
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,440
so we have lots of their different

981
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,520
products we have secure endpoint

982
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
formerly known as amp

983
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,599
so that's

984
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,520
on our end points

985
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
keeping an eye out for any malicious

986
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,880
attachments that might have come in

987
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
cisco umbrella that is a dns product

988
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,359
it has categories that we have marked to

989
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,760
block by default it also blocks newly

990
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,599
seen domains

991
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,920
and there's a custom block list that we

992
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,119
maintain

993
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,720
so if an email comes in but it made it

994
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,480
through with a bad link

995
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
we've got that option of blocking it

996
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,240
with umbrella and like i said some of

997
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,760
those are blocked automatically and then

998
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,680
we also have cisco firepower and the

999
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
main thing that we're using that for

1000
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,480
related to this is again geo blocking

1001
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,839
that operates with a blacklist uh

1002
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,640
block list versus an allow list

1003
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,480
but for example

1004
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,680
russia again if if that web server is

1005
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,839
located in russia you're not going to be

1006
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,400
able to get to it

1007
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,480
and then just other best practices which

1008
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,400
you know this isn't rocket science or

1009
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,040
anything mind-blowing for you but

1010
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,520
the this is also a consideration if that

1011
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,000
bad email gets through

1012
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,079
it is the end user going to be able to

1013
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,560
do something with it so remove the local

1014
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,200
admin permission just in case there's a

1015
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,160
bad

1016
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,319
attachment or a bad download

1017
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,480
especially with ransomware being all

1018
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,760
over the place

1019
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
we've had a lot of partner organizations

1020
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,720
get hit with ransomware in the past year

1021
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,560
so limit your east to west traffic in

1022
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,119
your network with micro segmentation

1023
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
multi-factor authentication if a user

1024
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,280
clicks the link and gives their username

1025
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,720
and password to the wrong website don't

1026
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,200
make that be an automatic open door for

1027
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
the cyber criminal and then security

1028
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,319
awareness training you need to help give

1029
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
your users the information and

1030
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,079
confidence to be able to make those

1031
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,920
calls as to whether or not that email

1032
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,040
may or may not be bad

1033
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,280
and just to mention this isn't

1034
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,960
specifically email security but this is

1035
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,720
my favorite book that i've run across so

1036
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,880
far related to cyber security it's

1037
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,119
written for a layperson

1038
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,839
but it inspired me to improve my cyber

1039
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,680
hygiene there's lots of good information

1040
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
in there after i got done reading it i

1041
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,760
lent it to my dad and he incorporated

1042
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,000
some of the suggestions as well

1043
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,079
which made my mother very unhappy

1044
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,280
because now she can't figure out what

1045
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
any of the passwords are but they are

1046
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,280
safer

1047
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,000
so if you have people in your life that

1048
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,599
aren't don't seem very concerned about

1049
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,560
cyber hygiene and they are readers this

1050
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
is a great present for them or you can

1051
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,000
read it and try to slip some of the

1052
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,560
information to them in conversation

1053
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,160
for example my uncle mark completely

1054
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,400
unconcerned about cyber

1055
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
hygiene he doesn't care if anybody gets

1056
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,680
access to his email because he doesn't

1057
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,000
have any important information in there

1058
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
so i tried to explain to him but what

1059
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,119
about all of your contacts if a bad guy

1060
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,760
gets access to your email account and

1061
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,160
starts sending out emails as you

1062
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,480
those people are going to trust you and

1063
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,079
click

1064
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,280
so

1065
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,240
for

1066
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,480
the benefit of everyone that you love

1067
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,839
uncle mark please take this a little bit

1068
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,839
more seriously

1069
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,960
so this is this is a great read

1070
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,440
in regards to that recommended for all

1071
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,839
levels

1072
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,599
so i've talked through why

1073
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,760
team health is a target

1074
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,920
and then ces and armor blocks as our

1075
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,599
main tools for that and all of our other

1076
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,440
layers of defense that we have in place

1077
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,680
at team health are there any other

1078
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,680
questions

1079
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,400
okay

1080
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,839
great thank you so much for your time

1081
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,750
this morning

1082
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,420
[Applause]
