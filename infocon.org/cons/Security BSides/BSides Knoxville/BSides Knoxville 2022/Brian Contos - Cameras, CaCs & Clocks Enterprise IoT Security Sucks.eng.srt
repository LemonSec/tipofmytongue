1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,600
all right uh so brian cantos with us

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,120
today um

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,560
uh first i want to let you know what's

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
going on across the street

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
brian's uh

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,719
brian's competition is a is a talk

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,640
called i hate you

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
so you're in the right place you don't

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
want to be hated brian loves you

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
no it's across the street it's uh

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
talking about getting along with

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
developer teams

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,400
so but here we've got brian cantos

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,679
presenting cameras cacs and clocks

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,880
enterprise iot security sucks a story of

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,320
2 million interrogated devices

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,520
[Music]

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,559
hello knoxville

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
all right never choose your walk-on

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
music after you've been drinking all

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,160
night

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
[Music]

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
so we're past our hdmi problems let's go

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
ahead and jump into this presentation

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
so a little bit about my background so

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
i've been cyber security for about 25

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
years

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
uh two ipos eight acquisitions

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
uh or my wife likes to say about five

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,840
pounds per company

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
little does she know it's actually

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
closer to 10 jokes on her

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
but started my career uh in cyber

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
warfare with disa down in fort huachuca

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
arizona

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
from there i said i want to get about as

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
far away as i can so i moved to brazil

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
and then after that i just started

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
working with tech companies building

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
startups from then on till today

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
currently the cso with phosphorus cyber

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
security set on a couple boards wrote a

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
couple books my last book i wrote was

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,759
with the director of the nsa uh that's

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,520
focused on physical and logical security

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
convergence which is this whole idea

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
even though we wrote that a little while

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,479
ago about iot and kind of merging that

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
with cyber security and figuring out how

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
they can enrich each other

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,560
so

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,360
what is iot if you ask each person in

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
this room they'll probably have a

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
different answer uh i'll throw out a

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
couple ideas and i'd like to hear what

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
you guys say like a printer

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,598
a mri machine

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
a scada device for example uh even a

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
satellite

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
how about you guys let's go ahead and

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,560
just yell out some iot devices

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
coffee makers absolutely

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
refrigerators

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
microwaves routers switches

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,360
cars

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
so pretty much everything right

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
so the way to kind of boil it down and

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,440
again there's a zillion different

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
definitions but a purpose-built device

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
connected to the network with some type

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
of embedded firmware and generally

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
speaking that's android it's linux

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
busybox vxworks ubuntu things of that

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
nature on the router side usually things

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,959
like bsd etc but there's a lot of things

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
that fall into the iot

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
ot network device group

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,959
i'm going to be turning my head a little

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
bit to look at these because my laptop's

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
way over there because we have a short

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
cable

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
not trying to be rude uh

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
we've started looking at iot devices in

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
about 2017

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
and it's a continuing project but now

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
we've looked at uh multiple million iot

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,920
devices mostly across fortune 500 global

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
2000 and government agencies so you

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
didn't really focus on home iot devices

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
roomba vacuums lg vac lg washing

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
machines ring doorbells alexa that's a

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
different category the consumer stuff

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
it's cloud managed cloud upgradeable

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,239
we're focusing mostly on enterprise

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,680
level stuff the stuff that you'd see in

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,360
the business

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
this was a global exercise continues to

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
be a global exercise but i'd say the

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
majority of the customers were based uh

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
in the united states

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
so a little bit of history to kind of

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
tie into this because i really think it

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
helps frame this whole concept of what

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
we're doing a quick raise of hands here

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,840
who thinks we probably live in one of

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
the most technologically innovative

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
points in human history

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,959
right not a trick question i think

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
probably most of us would agree um

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
although i've heard

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
that if the greeks hadn't been sacked by

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,760
rome

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
in what 323 bc

114
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
that by 1492 when columbus cruised over

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
to the bahamas

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
that the greeks would have had a

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,238
man-spaced expedition to mars

118
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,918
if their technology continued to

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
increase at the same rate

120
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,358
but my dad told me that and he's from

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
greece so consider the source

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
um

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
but as you see as we evolve from cave

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
paintings

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
and alphabet written language paper etc

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
every once in a while we have a pretty

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
major leap a quantum leap if you will

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
one such event was in 1804 joseph marie

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
jacquard invented the automatic loom

130
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
looked like this

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
some would say this is the world's first

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,440
computer

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
now it's made for making textiles

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
specifically it was making blankets and

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
as you look at it

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
it's a predecessor to computer punch

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
cards or more so computer punch tape

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,800
which most of us weren't around for

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
but

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,240
this design allowed these textile

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
manufacturers to go from making about a

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,039
dozen blankets a day to making hundreds

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
of blankets a day

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,639
if you look at it it's got input output

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
storage memory it's got all the things

146
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
that we would consider a computer it was

147
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
about two decades before babbage and ada

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
lovelace and all that so it's a pretty

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,639
awesome invention

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
he just marketed it right

151
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
so you've got this

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,919
machine

153
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,960
and the

154
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
the employees are like holy cow we're

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,479
going to lose our jobs to this thing

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
right so they're a little bit nervous

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
about it

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
so what did they do

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
they broke into the factory at night and

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
they sabotaged it now some historians

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,479
will say that's where the term saboteur

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
came from but i always thought it was

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
ironic that the world's first computer

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
suffered an insider threat

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
so now we jump into sort of the modern

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
age post arpanet we see things like

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
tcpip the first computer um

168
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
the internet becomes commercialized if

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
you will all the way up to what we're

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
looking at today with iot devices where

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,400
we have satellites receiving data we

172
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
literally have zetabytes of data being

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,000
transferred back and forth and

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
everything now is being connected

175
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
healthcare devices

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
uh discrete and batch manufacturing

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
devices military equipment so on and so

178
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
forth so pretty incredible

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
now if we look at how the threat window

180
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,880
has changed looking at sort of from

181
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,759
commercialization of a specific

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,280
innovation to when it was actually

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
attacked it's a really interesting

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,759
dichotomy as well so take 3000 bc the

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
mediterranean sea

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
that's when they first said hey you've

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
got stuff over here

188
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
i've got stuff to trade over here why

189
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
don't we stick out on a boat and trade

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
the first notion of trade

191
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
1300 bc were the first recorded pirates

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
so it took about 1700 years before

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
somebody said why don't we just rob that

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
boat

195
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
that's a pretty big threat window

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
then we have air

197
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
1859 john weiss said hey i'm going to

198
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,599
take this hot air balloon and i'm going

199
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,440
to commercialize it i'm going to use it

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
to move mail

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
and the project crashed and burned it

202
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
literally crashed and it literally

203
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,039
burned

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
but we didn't have the first hijacking

205
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
until 1931

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,720
not 1700 years but a pretty gosh darn

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
big threat window

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
1962 telstar just a couple years after

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,319
sputnik owned by at t first commercial

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,520
satellite used for television

211
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
broadcasting

212
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
we haven't seen too much as it relates

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
to satellite warfare there are some

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
isolated incidents with nation states

215
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,919
but usually the juice isn't worth the

216
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,440
squeeze because those types of

217
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
satellites have a dedicated base station

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
so you have to attack the base station

219
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
to get to the satellite and usually

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
they're in closed off environments so it

221
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,440
has happened it is pretty rare but in

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
2015 we saw truly data theft which was a

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,440
command and control device that was

224
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
being used to operate off of satellites

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
so we have seen it yet pretty rare

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
1988 first commercialization of the

227
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
internet nsfnet said hey we got a bunch

228
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,479
of people using email mci said so do we

229
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,720
let's charge people and they can email

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
each other what a novel concept

231
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
pretty much a threat window of zero so

232
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,680
if anybody here remembers the morris

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
worm

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
which used our commands and finger it

235
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
was supposed to spread about a dozen

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
devices per day

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
and it spread at thousands of devices

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
per minute and pretty much any internet

239
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,240
accessible device that was accessible

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
was compromised before this later on a

241
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
paper was written at berkeley called

242
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
warhol worms that said in the future the

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
internet could be taken down in 15

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
minutes or less which was based on andy

245
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
warhol's statement in the future

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
everyone's going to be famous for 15

247
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,120
minutes

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
that brings us to iot

249
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
in the iot toaster which was the first

250
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,440
official iot device but iot became kind

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
of commercially popular about 2010

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
in about 2016 is when we saw the first

253
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
iot specific malware and botnets and

254
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
that was tied to mirai

255
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,720
so again we're seeing compressed

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
zones throughout this entire ecosystem

257
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,839
and i'm going to go into mariah in a

258
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
little bit as we start talking about the

259
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
most hacked devices and share some

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
examples with you so first i just wanted

261
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
to throw a couple stats out there to

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
kind of frame this

263
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
67 percent of the companies we talked to

264
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
again fortune 500 global 2000's

265
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
government agencies

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
67 percent have had a breach or attack

267
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
related to iot

268
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,640
so these breaches are things like data

269
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
theft so they'll attack the iot device

270
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,600
move laterally to your it devices and

271
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
exfiltrate sensitive data

272
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,720
emails database information file server

273
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,360
information stuff on people's laptops an

274
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
attack could be taking over devices and

275
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
use it for crypto jacking we see a lot

276
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,959
of that we actually had a customer that

277
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
detected that they got compromised on

278
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
their iot devices they had 10 000

279
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
security cameras

280
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
i'd love to say it was splunk or some

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
incident responder that caught it their

282
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,480
power bill their power bill went up by 7

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
000

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
so

285
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
which is an anomaly

286
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
um

287
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
so if any of you have done any type of

288
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
crypto mining uh legally or illegally

289
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,079
you know it sucks a lot of power

290
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,560
but 67 percent we don't have great stats

291
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
on the people that don't know they've

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
been attacked so there's that

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
security teams able to identify the

294
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
majority of their iot devices twenty

295
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
percent

296
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,160
honestly most companies don't even know

297
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
what they've got

298
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,120
and then

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
enterprises increasing iot security

300
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
spend this one's positive at least

301
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
people get it they're like you know what

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
we have a lot of iot devices

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
they're not secure they're connected to

304
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
our it environment and they're posing a

305
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,560
massive risk

306
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
we better start putting some money into

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
it so that's a good thing

308
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
who heroes use showdown

309
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
so here's a fun little take home project

310
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
type in something like voiceover ip

311
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
security camera

312
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
printer or ups

313
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
and see what's connected who would ever

314
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
connect a ups system to the naked

315
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
internet

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
well you can't really read it there but

317
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
almost fourteen thousand

318
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
why would a ups be connected to the

319
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
internet let alone fourteen 000. and

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
here's the fun fact

321
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,279
one of the most popular ups is apc

322
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
we have a running joke in the company

323
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
that says if we ever find

324
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
an apc system that doesn't have the

325
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
default credential apc apc lower case

326
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,519
you can google it i'm not sharing

327
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,640
anything

328
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
we'll buy the other guy a steak dinner

329
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,959
we've eaten nothing but chicken since we

330
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,160
started this

331
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
almost every single apc system that's

332
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
probably plugged into really critical

333
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,800
devices has the default password and 14

334
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
000 of them are internet accessible

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
if you could read the part here that

336
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
said uh security camera

337
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
it's about 5 million

338
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
something else that's interesting who's

339
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
heard of the russian frontend iot

340
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
hacking tool

341
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
so this is really neat this was a tool

342
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
designed by contractors for the russian

343
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
fsb

344
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
the russian fsb wanted a tool that would

345
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
allow them to target iot devices

346
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,720
compromise those devices move laterally

347
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
to it

348
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
siphon information from there to the iot

349
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
device then out to whatever location

350
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
they want to send it to

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
very powerful tool

352
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
a hacking group called digital

353
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
revolution found out about it stole it

354
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
stuck it on a bunch of turrets and made

355
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
it available to the world

356
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
so now if you'd like to get this tool

357
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,639
and play with it have at it it was paid

358
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
for by the russian fsb

359
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
another interesting thing about iot some

360
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
people know that some don't

361
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
there's some that come shipped from the

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,720
factory with malware pre-installed

363
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,399
so many in fact that the u.s house of

364
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
representative passed a bill that said

365
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
these china-based firms huawei zte

366
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,279
hickvision and a couple others are

367
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
completely banned in government agencies

368
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,440
and government contractors they have

369
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
malware they have phone home

370
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
capabilities they have a number of

371
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
problems that they're saying they're not

372
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
even allowed here

373
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
another fun fact two years ago the most

374
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
popular consumer based camera on amazon

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
came pre-loaded with malware

376
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
you completely skipped the middle man

377
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
the malware is already there it saves

378
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,000
you time it's more efficient

379
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
so stories from the trenches let's get

380
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
into the good stuff

381
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
so mirai botnet i mentioned this a

382
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,000
little bit earlier

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
this happened in 2016. this is always

384
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
the poster child for hacking iot so i'm

385
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,000
going to show you this one i'm going to

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
show you something that just happened a

387
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
few days ago

388
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
this tells you how non-complicated these

389
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,399
attacks are

390
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
so what these hackers started doing was

391
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
scanning the internet for a specific

392
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
type of video camera

393
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
this video camera had telnet running on

394
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,399
port 23 which we usually see in port

395
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,680
2323 which we sometimes see so he said

396
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
i'm looking for devices with a tool like

397
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
showdown like we looked at earlier

398
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
would tell that open

399
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
okay so far pretty basic right

400
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
next thing they did is they said let's

401
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
go ahead and try the default password

402
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
and the default password worked on more

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
than half of those devices they said

404
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
let's try some very common passwords and

405
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
that worked for about another 20 percent

406
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
they had created such a massive botnet

407
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
that they were able to take out paypal

408
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,399
reddit sony netflix these are companies

409
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,959
with pretty juicy networks

410
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,839
using a botnet made up of mostly cameras

411
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079
i say mostly because here's the kicker

412
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,079
in the iot world

413
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,519
they're not usually tech companies that

414
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
are building these iot devices they're

415
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
traditional manufacturing companies

416
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,760
so what do they do they use shared

417
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
libraries they use white listing and

418
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,440
when you do that you get shared

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
vulnerabilities and shared default

420
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
passwords and they have teams of maybe

421
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,399
two or three people that aren't

422
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
incentivized to do security there's no

423
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
security development life cycle it's a

424
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
piece of farming equipment and you ask

425
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,880
steve to make the internet accessible

426
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,079
and he wants to get it done as quickly

427
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,600
as he can so he can move on to the next

428
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
thing that's kind of what we see

429
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
juxtaposed to like alexa or something

430
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
where they have 10 000 engineers focused

431
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
on it that has a higher level of

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
security

433
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
so because of that white labeling

434
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
because of those shared libraries it

435
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,079
just wasn't this camera that the hackers

436
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
found

437
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
that same code was on printers

438
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
voice over ip phones desk set boxes

439
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
because they had those same shared

440
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
libraries and white labeled systems in

441
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,880
there so it didn't become just cameras

442
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
became cameras plus a whole lot more

443
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
what's even worse is because the

444
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
half-life of firmware updating is so low

445
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,199
on iot devices you'll find these iot

446
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
devices living with really old like

447
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
decade old firmware

448
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
that some devices are not only still

449
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
vulnerable to mirai they still have

450
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
mirai running on them and nobody knows

451
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
the camera's still flickering

452
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
the uh this other device is still

453
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
detecting

454
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,079
so what do i need to pay attention for

455
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,120
so that's 2016 still relevant today this

456
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,199
just came out a couple days ago

457
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,440
this was released by mandian it's called

458
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,519
quiet exit and this is really pretty

459
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,880
interesting

460
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,240
so the attackers were targeting

461
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
network devices layer 2 layer 3 network

462
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
devices things like san arrays load

463
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,519
balancers wireless access points some

464
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,880
switches some routers again vsd systems

465
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
and they're also attacking iot systems

466
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
like voice over ip video cameras ntp

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
clock systems

468
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,120
and some other things like gunshot

469
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
detection devices that can actually

470
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
detect if a shot was fired they have

471
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
them on a lot of college campuses

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
unfortunately it can triangulate say

473
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,279
there's an active shooter

474
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,639
so they're started targeting these

475
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
devices

476
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
and those are mostly linux and android

477
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
so they said we're going to compile the

478
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
software which is just dropbear ssh

479
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
client server pretty well known stuff

480
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,680
we're going to write it so it runs on

481
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
these bsd devices and it runs on these

482
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
iot devices why'd they do that

483
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
because no one's watching because no

484
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
one's digging into this stuff no one's

485
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,720
looking at the logs

486
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,560
and who's going to expect the switch or

487
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,079
the wireless access point or the video

488
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,519
camera could do anything malicious it

489
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
looks so safe

490
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
so they could hide out there essentially

491
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
these are a hide

492
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
once they had access and command and

493
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,559
control activity they did it through a

494
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,119
reverse ssh tunnel they were able then

495
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
to make api calls to local microsoft

496
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
exchange and cloud-based microsoft 365.

497
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
using that they targeted the emails of

498
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
executive security staff corporate

499
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
development m a teams etc and then they

500
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
pump that information out through

501
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
those compromised network devices

502
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
and iot devices back to the attackers

503
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
and in many cases this was going on for

504
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
more than a year and a half i guarantee

505
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
you

506
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,320
there's organizations in the thousands

507
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
that have these devices already

508
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
compromised running this type of malware

509
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
on their network devices on their iot

510
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
devices that's siphoning off their

511
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,039
information today it's a very very quiet

512
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,120
very stealthy way to laterally move for

513
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
the organization because nobody suspects

514
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
this it's like a land war in china you

515
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,399
don't expect it

516
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
so question for the audience

517
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,039
what percentage of iot devices operate

518
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
with default passwords any idea

519
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
okay

520
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,480
87.

521
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
did somebody say half

522
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,799
half

523
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,320
50

524
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
and if i told you 50 of your it devices

525
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
were running default passwords you'd

526
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
probably be pretty concerned and leave

527
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,679
the conference right now and go fix them

528
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
but we haven't thought about it that way

529
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
previously

530
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,360
so fifty percent a hundred percent of

531
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
the passwords on these iot devices

532
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
network devices in ot are out of policy

533
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
they're not rotated every 90 days

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
they're not complex

535
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
at all and they're usually as short as

536
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
they possibly can be now there are some

537
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
iot devices that say i can only be a

538
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,480
four digit pin and it has to be numeric

539
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
or i can be 10 characters long but no

540
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
special characters or i could be 20 but

541
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
not the letter b we've seen all sorts of

542
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
stupid and crazy ways that this stuff is

543
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
approached

544
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,160
but 50 percent

545
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
and of the 50 that aren't default they

546
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,559
were changed once at the time of

547
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,240
installation

548
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
things like major financial institution

549
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
dash

550
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,120
2013

551
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
right that's the type of thing that you

552
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
see all the time

553
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
so when you say hack

554
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
it's not necessarily hack

555
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,160
it's login

556
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
that's what we're doing

557
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
so here was an interesting case this was

558
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,000
at a stock exchange and as most of you

559
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,679
know when you're trading stock

560
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
milliseconds matter if you have a two or

561
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
three millisecond advantage over me that

562
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
could be millions or tens or hundreds of

563
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,919
millions of dollars so they have these

564
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,240
really really expensive ntp systems

565
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
there's cesium clocks atomic clocks

566
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,559
now these clocks are not cheap they're

567
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
incredibly expensive more most more

568
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
probably than a lot of people's data

569
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
centers

570
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
but what they were able to do

571
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,720
with these ntp things are keep stock

572
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
trade trading safe

573
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
so we went in there and they said how

574
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,520
many of these guys do you have and they

575
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,039
said we think we have about

576
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
you know about six

577
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
we found out they had 15 of them they

578
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,080
didn't even know how many they had

579
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
because they had a poor inventory back

580
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
to that other stat only 20 of

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
organizations really know what they have

582
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
even when they're super super duper

583
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
expensive cesium clocks

584
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
right within their network so keeping an

585
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,080
inventory is a huge issue now another

586
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
interesting thing about this clock is

587
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,799
there were no vulnerabilities there was

588
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
no cbes not because it's uber safe and

589
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
secure

590
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
because they've only made like 100 of

591
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
these there's a very finite

592
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
audience for such an accurate clock

593
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
willing to spend that type of money and

594
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
once you get past stock exchanges it's

595
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,799
pretty much nobody maybe military

596
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,679
this i like to call the most uh

597
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
horrific chart to simply say

598
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,679
most companies have about three to five

599
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,480
iot devices per employee so if you have

600
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,559
a company with 10 000 employees you

601
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
probably have between 30 and 50 000 and

602
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
you're saying brian that sounds like a

603
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,480
lot and you're right it is

604
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
most customers also yes

605
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,120
about 40 60 off

606
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
hey guys how many iot devices do you

607
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
think you have in your company i don't

608
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
know twenty thousand and then we take a

609
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,000
look oh you've got forty thousand or

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,799
fifty thousand consistently forty to

611
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,640
sixty percent off based on their

612
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,880
assumptions juxtaposed to evidence-based

613
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,240
information that says look at all you've

614
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,360
got

615
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,400
and we're going to go through a couple

616
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
of those examples and dive in the most

617
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
horrific offenders that we see out there

618
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,320
but three to five is quite a bit

619
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,320
so

620
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,600
printers

621
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
printers are interesting this this is

622
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
one of the most commonly attacked iot

623
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
devices by nation states

624
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,799
period

625
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
why because they're super promiscuous

626
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
they've got every port

627
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
every service open i'm wired i'm wired

628
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
list i've got bluetooth bluetooth low

629
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
energy i've got all these different ways

630
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
of accessing me because i want to be

631
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
promiscuous i want you to connect to me

632
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,640
i want you to be able to print

633
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,799
they also have about 20 gig hard drives

634
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,120
on them not big not small by today's

635
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
standards but enough so if you can get

636
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
malware on there you can do some

637
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
interesting things so we're working with

638
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,679
a customer that had over 250 of these

639
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
printers compromised they found out

640
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,520
actually through splunk

641
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,039
after about three months they said oh

642
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
we're getting a lot of traffic from

643
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
these devices and they look like

644
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
printers why is that

645
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,679
so the attackers had compromised the

646
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
printers it looks like they actually got

647
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
in through a phishing to somebody else's

648
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
email then look through printers so they

649
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,159
could again attack and hide like we saw

650
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,520
in quiet exit

651
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,880
so they went from the laptop to the

652
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
printer that was their base of operation

653
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
from the printers they loaded some of

654
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
their tools and they went out and

655
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,480
started looking for information on

656
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
databases active directory enumerating

657
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,120
the networks etc they compressed the

658
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
information

659
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
on the drives on the printers and they

660
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,039
exfiltrate it over icmp

661
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
has anybody here ever done data

662
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,280
exfiltration over icmp

663
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,760
a couple people it sucks

664
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
you have to break it into the smallest

665
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
little bites it's like saying here's a

666
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,559
bag of rice

667
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,400
i want you to take each grain and slice

668
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,480
it about 50 times and then slowly put it

669
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,600
in this bowl

670
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
that's what it's like but if you

671
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,960
automate it it's okay

672
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
and it goes under the radar because

673
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
everybody says oh it's just a ping it's

674
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
icmp echo request three it couldn't be

675
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,760
bad

676
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
and it operations and network ops they

677
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
always leave that open

678
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
for testing and validation just to make

679
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
sure everything's up and running

680
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,840
so they're exfiltrating data and the

681
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
biggest problem was the firmware that

682
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
was running on these printers in some

683
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
cases were older than some of the

684
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
employees at this company

685
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
so which brings me to this question what

686
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
percentage of iot devices operate with

687
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
not old firmware but end of life

688
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,640
firmware any ideas

689
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,919
end of life

690
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
any ideas

691
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,400
70. 60. pretty pretty close

692
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
26

693
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,200
26 of the firmware so old is no longer

694
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,440
supported and oddly enough a lot of iot

695
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,679
vendors too are kind of they come on the

696
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,200
scene after a few years they go out of

697
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
business they're not even around anymore

698
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
so you can't even get the firmware but

699
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
what's worse than the 26 percent albeit

700
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,919
really bad

701
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,559
is that the remaining 74 the average age

702
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,320
is six years

703
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
again we talked about the mirai botnet

704
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,080
and the reason it was so effective

705
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
because the half life on firmware

706
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,520
patching sucks

707
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,159
nobody does it because it's manual who's

708
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,080
gonna manually go through three to five

709
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
iot devices per employee thirty to fifty

710
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
thousand devices for ten thousand

711
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
employee company and manually change the

712
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
firmware where you gotta stick a paper

713
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
clip in there and stand on one foot and

714
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
hop around right it just doesn't work

715
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,000
in the old days it didn't work we're

716
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
going to talk about some tools that will

717
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,279
help

718
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
this was an interesting one because this

719
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
one actually impacted a microsoft azure

720
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
customer so this was all about

721
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
vulnerabilities

722
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
these firmwares aren't just old

723
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,279
and if they did change the default

724
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
password so you can't simply log on

725
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
there's so many cves especially level

726
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,559
eights nines and tens our favorite cvss

727
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,159
scores of tens

728
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,400
that they can compromise them compound

729
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
that by the fact that they always seem

730
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,240
to love running cleartext protocols not

731
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,360
just telnet and ftp but like tftp

732
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,799
from like the 90s

733
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,799
right and all sorts of old stuff goes

734
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
back to the white labeling

735
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,880
and it goes back to the shared libraries

736
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
when you've got developers that can't

737
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
write hello world without a library

738
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
so you end up in this situation where

739
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,919
you have highly vulnerable systems they

740
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,840
were able to compromise enough devices

741
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,360
where their aggregate processing and

742
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,840
bandwidth was rivaling that of amazon

743
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,360
and google

744
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
with just a bunch of iot devices and

745
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
they took down customers with a ddos

746
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
attack in microsoft azure

747
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,760
um when it comes to cbs scores i

748
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
mentioned the numbers

749
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
fifty percent of devices have a level

750
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,159
eight and another eighteen have nines

751
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,279
and tens

752
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,400
for those of you who aren't familiar

753
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
with the scoring system is one to ten

754
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
ten is the worst ten means

755
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,679
with hardly any effort at all with

756
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,760
remote access i can get administrative

757
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,679
access to that device

758
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,480
with very minimal skill

759
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
if you know how to like type an ip

760
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
address that's kind of all you really

761
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,240
need to know

762
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
so what i like to equate this to

763
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,679
iot security today

764
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,360
was like i.t security in about 1995.

765
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
did anybody here work in security in the

766
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,760
90s the mid 90s

767
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,080
nobody so two people so we're the only

768
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,879
two old people here

769
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,320
so that was the days of windows nt 3.51

770
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
that's when hackers came out you're

771
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,080
going to see that later today

772
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,600
it was an interesting time because we

773
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
didn't know where all our it devices

774
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
were we had really crappy credential

775
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,960
management patching was sporadic at best

776
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
and i'll tell you about some of my early

777
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
projects i worked on back then some of

778
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
you might recognize this us robotics

779
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,080
modem that was the bee's knees back in

780
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,440
the day if you had that modem you were

781
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
the cool kids

782
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,360
but i was on this project with disa

783
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,279
called the umap unauthorized moment

784
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,120
abatement project which was a really

785
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
fancy way of saying hey brian you're the

786
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
new guy why don't you run around and

787
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,400
find all the modems out on in the

788
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
environment and see if they're being

789
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
used and if they're not stick stick them

790
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
in a box

791
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,799
all right that sounds like a great job

792
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,360
i'll get on that so i downloaded this

793
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,399
tool

794
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,840
that some of you might have used which

795
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,000
is a war dialer called tone loc it was

796
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
written by minor threat and mucho mas

797
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,360
and it ran in dos

798
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
and basically instead of ip addresses i

799
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
would put in a bank of telephone numbers

800
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,279
and say war dialed these and it came

801
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
back and said oh that's a phone that's a

802
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,279
fax machine back when there was fax

803
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,480
machines or that's a modem

804
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
and the pbx guys loved it because it

805
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
actually drove them nuts

806
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
um and then i would go around to people

807
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,799
and say physically face to face hey

808
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,279
steve do you need this modem no i don't

809
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
well i put it in a box hey bob do you

810
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
need this modem yeah the vendor hat

811
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,799
needs that for autobahn access and that

812
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,360
was how i spent some of the 90s

813
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,320
then

814
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,159
i found this tool called satan security

815
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,760
administrator tool for analyzing

816
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,679
networks written by dan farmer it's how

817
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
i learned how to write pearl which for

818
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,679
about a decade was a cool skill now not

819
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,200
so much

820
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,799
so i ran that on my sun spark one plus

821
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,720
pizza box that i had running solaris i

822
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,960
think slayers 2.5 or something at the

823
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
time so i used that sun box running

824
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
satan to do vulnerability scanning and

825
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,360
help identify all the vulnerabilities

826
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,480
that i could find in the network and

827
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
that was a lot of fun i said that's way

828
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,840
better than looking for modems

829
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,200
then they say we need to install a

830
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
firewall say what's a firewall kind of

831
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
figured out what it is so it was on

832
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
three and a half inch floppies we had

833
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
checkpoint firewall which we loaded on

834
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
this device

835
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
i never uninstalled satan because why

836
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
would you who knew

837
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
so we had our firewall also running our

838
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,720
vulnerability scanner which seemed very

839
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,919
prudent because we were saving money

840
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,760
because it was another 3 000 bucks to

841
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,960
buy a server

842
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,039
so that kind of frames what the 90s was

843
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,480
like for security and it's exactly where

844
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
iot security is today it really

845
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
really sucks

846
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,399
so

847
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
this is the fun part these are the

848
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,720
biggest offenders these are the devices

849
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
that time in every single time we go

850
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
into an organization they are just

851
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,960
utterly messed up

852
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,080
so

853
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
kvm switches keyboard video mouse most

854
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,159
of you know you've got a switch in your

855
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
rack instead of having five monitors

856
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
five keyboards five mice you've got one

857
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,679
of these you can access all the other

858
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,960
devices

859
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
most of these that we come across are

860
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,679
running ubuntu linux version 10

861
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,080
from 2010.

862
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,600
we're on version roughly 22 right now

863
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
so you've got all this endpoint security

864
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
and encryption and application security

865
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,640
and multi-factor authentication and

866
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
network security and all these things

867
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
that identity management but the kvm

868
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
switch has

869
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,320
10 year old or more

870
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,760
software running out just filled with

871
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,919
vulnerabilities and easy to compromise

872
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,200
so you can access all the systems

873
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
connected to them why because a lot of

874
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,039
people don't even know those devices are

875
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,240
little linux servers that you can

876
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
connect to

877
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
next one just as bad i would say even

878
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,240
worse lights out management

879
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
so this this little guy well these are

880
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,919
your ethernet connections

881
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,120
while this looks like an ethernet

882
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
connection it's not it's your lights out

883
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
management port

884
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,720
same idea except the fact that this is

885
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
actually built into the server so this

886
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,360
here

887
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
is a little linux server running on your

888
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
big server whatever that happens to be

889
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,760
so by connecting to that you don't just

890
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,039
have

891
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,440
the ability to log in

892
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,600
change network settings you can launch a

893
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,559
virtual shell a virtual terminal you can

894
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,720
upload software or malware and today

895
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
there's specific malware designed to

896
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,880
target this

897
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,559
because once you get in again it doesn't

898
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,640
matter your application security your

899
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,960
data security encryption whatever i have

900
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,520
direct access to these you might have

901
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
heard terms like

902
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
hp has

903
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,559
ilo

904
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,640
and dell has idrac

905
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,279
and super micro has ipmi

906
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,720
these are all different names for the

907
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
same thing they're all linux servers and

908
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,559
they're almost always vulnerable and

909
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,080
never upgraded so a great way to get

910
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,679
access

911
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
racks and cabinets no one thinks about

912
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
this stuff they've got ups systems in

913
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
there and we already talked about how

914
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
secure those are apc apc

915
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
they've got cable management they've got

916
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,440
cooling systems they got tamper

917
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,480
protection a lot of iot devices in there

918
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,919
and the reason they're not upgraded is

919
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,840
because all the servers that sit in them

920
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,440
they have to be rebooted when this thing

921
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
has its firmware upgraded and it has to

922
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
be rebooted so when you schedule

923
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,279
downtime to update that database that

924
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,440
web server that critical device

925
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,640
you don't think about doing the same

926
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,120
thing to the rack again like kvm and

927
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,120
like lights out gives you direct access

928
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,720
physical systems this is a really

929
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
interesting one because in the world of

930
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,440
iot

931
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,840
it's not just attack on the iot device

932
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,919
and the lateral movement to cyber but it

933
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
can have impact on the physical world i

934
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
can take a security camera and turn it

935
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,919
around and spy on you with both audio

936
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,279
and video

937
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,440
i can unlock your doors i can shut down

938
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
your power when it comes to batch and

939
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,159
discrete manufacturing industrial

940
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,159
devices ot

941
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,720
when it comes to military grade devices

942
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
internet of battlefield things can be

943
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
far far more destructive but we were

944
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
working with a financial services

945
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
customer

946
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,120
and we showed them remotely how we were

947
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
able to gain access not hacking just

948
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
gain access to these devices and open

949
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,120
and close at random 6400 doors

950
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
including the front door the door to the

951
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
data centers and everything in between

952
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
nor tech security

953
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
who makes a lot of these physical access

954
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,399
devices

955
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,960
were well known for shipping out devices

956
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,799
pre-loaded

957
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,960
with vulnerabilities with cvss scores of

958
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,080
9.8 and 10 out of 10 which again is

959
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
remote full administrative access over

960
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
these devices

961
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
huge huge hole who cares about the cyber

962
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,039
security stuff if you can just get in

963
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,480
through this stuff and then go steal the

964
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,240
server

965
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,519
we talked about printers i'm not going

966
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,120
to belabor that too much except to say

967
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,200
in 2019 at black hat there was a

968
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,039
discussion where they said here's 10 000

969
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,799
different printers versions and types

970
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,320
that came with

971
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,760
critical level

972
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,559
10

973
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,600
out of 10

974
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
pre-installed again they're super

975
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
promiscuous they're multi-vector access

976
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
bluetooth bluetooth low energy all these

977
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
ways of getting access and state

978
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
sponsored attackers love it most of the

979
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,159
stuff we see out of russia most of stuff

980
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,159
out of china and other nation states are

981
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,640
going after this one they're insecure

982
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
two everyone's got them and three nobody

983
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
suspects them

984
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,519
this is an interesting one as well voice

985
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
over ip phones

986
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,360
and video conferencing systems

987
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,440
there's a voice over i p phone that's

988
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
extremely popular and ships with ssh

989
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,399
access

990
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,720
undocumented in the manual

991
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,360
with default credentials

992
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,840
and a lot of the vendors that packaged

993
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,519
up because of white labeling and shared

994
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,519
libraries didn't even know it's running

995
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,200
ssh

996
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,799
could you imagine shipping out a piece

997
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,320
of equipment and you don't even know you

998
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,799
have port 22 open or that nobody even

999
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,720
bothered to do maybe a port scan of the

1000
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,360
device and see what's active

1001
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
crazy right

1002
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
we went to one location they had 31 000

1003
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,280
phones and i don't know if this is good

1004
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,760
news or bad news but only 700 of them

1005
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
had critical cbes

1006
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,719
only takes one but they had 700.

1007
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,760
okay so audience participation

1008
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
i've just mentioned a bunch of devices

1009
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,040
there's one device type i didn't mention

1010
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
in that group which is the biggest

1011
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,399
defender

1012
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,598
biggest iot offender

1013
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
who said cameras

1014
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,000
yep absolutely right security cameras

1015
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
the biggest security cameras suck the

1016
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,960
most

1017
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,679
so

1018
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,719
here's the thing about security cameras

1019
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,480
a lot of organizations we go into just

1020
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,320
don't have hundreds or even thousands

1021
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
but sometimes tens of thousands

1022
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,800
especially if you go into like retailers

1023
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,560
financial services

1024
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,839
military

1025
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,520
cameras upon cameras upon cameras but

1026
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,119
that's not the big problem

1027
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,880
remember the end of the last spider-man

1028
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
where all the spider-men were pointing

1029
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,839
at each other who's managing it well i t

1030
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,040
no security no physical security has

1031
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
that no some vendors doing it nobody

1032
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,160
knows who's managing it

1033
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
and again some of them ship with malware

1034
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
already installed some of them are

1035
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,839
illegal to run

1036
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,920
because they're so vulnerable

1037
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,960
um

1038
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
and virtually every enterprise has these

1039
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,720
and they're just being attacked all the

1040
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,520
time crypto jacking is another big one

1041
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
you guys might have heard this story

1042
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,839
about the las vegas casino they had a

1043
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,240
iot enabled thermometer and a fish tank

1044
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
i don't know if anybody heard this one

1045
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,320
the thermometer got hacked

1046
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,839
and from that thermometer they moved

1047
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,320
laterally they got access to the

1048
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,800
customer database and more specifically

1049
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
the database of the whales

1050
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,079
that spend millions and millions and

1051
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,079
millions of dollars there their contact

1052
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,720
information banking information what

1053
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,240
types of things they like in their rooms

1054
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
and i'm sure there's very personal

1055
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,200
things in there as well all from a

1056
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,359
thermometer and a fish tank

1057
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
right so it can be something as

1058
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
innocuous as that where they probably

1059
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,839
didn't have tens and tens of thousands

1060
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,280
even though they had that for cameras

1061
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,000
but it just takes one device

1062
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
so we talked mostly about enterprise iot

1063
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,079
security there's a lot of other fields

1064
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,240
internet of battlefield things we work a

1065
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,560
lot with the military on these devices

1066
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
some of these are on soldiers some of

1067
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,079
these are on vehicles some of these are

1068
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,680
on forward camps there's a lot of places

1069
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,520
these are deployed

1070
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
industrial internet of things that's

1071
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
when we get into things like ot scada

1072
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
plc equipment

1073
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,720
digital devices that control physics

1074
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
essentially right flow

1075
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,160
temperature

1076
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,240
volume things of that nature internet of

1077
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
healthcare things uh we were working

1078
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
with a healthcare agency healthcare

1079
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,040
provider that had mri devices and x-ray

1080
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,280
machines that were compromised not for

1081
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,640
ransomware attacks we always think

1082
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
healthcare ransomware they're actually

1083
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
taking the information

1084
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,880
from the scans in hopes of potentially

1085
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,800
using that as blackmail or some other

1086
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
device

1087
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,520
you get your credit card information

1088
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
your banking information stolen that

1089
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,880
sucks your healthcare information though

1090
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
you can't really change that

1091
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,240
so hey maybe we're going to get somebody

1092
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,040
famous a ceo a hollywood movie star

1093
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,720
something like that so they're actually

1094
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,200
put malware on these devices

1095
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,440
smart ships smart buildings smart cities

1096
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
all different versions of the same thing

1097
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,119
a lot of these are ultra connected

1098
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,720
baltimore had an attack that ended up

1099
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
costing them tens of millions of dollars

1100
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,800
in their iot infrastructure

1101
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
police and emergency services were

1102
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,599
completely shut down all based on iot

1103
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
not traditional cyber and then network

1104
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,640
gear we talked about quiet exit and how

1105
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,480
these attacks now are embedding and

1106
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,160
installing because they've been compiled

1107
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,200
for bsd on your san array on your load

1108
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
balancer on your wireless access point

1109
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,200
so we're seeing a lot of network gear

1110
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,560
because again it's a purpose-built

1111
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,520
device

1112
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,040
that's running dedicated firmware

1113
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
connected to the network that you

1114
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
probably can't install an agent on so it

1115
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
falls into that iot category

1116
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
so

1117
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,599
there's some ways to combat this and i'm

1118
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,280
going to share a couple tools with you

1119
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,240
guys

1120
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
at the very end i'll actually give you

1121
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
the brand so if you want to take a look

1122
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,640
at some of those you absolutely can but

1123
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,000
let's see what hollywood can teach us

1124
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
about addressing iot attacks

1125
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
so issues with discovery

1126
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
so the first step is knowing what you've

1127
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,079
got again 20 of organizations kind of

1128
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,760
have a feel of what they have

1129
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,839
the rest don't and most of those people

1130
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,400
that are 20 don't really know so what's

1131
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,079
an old-school way of finding your iot

1132
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,800
devices using vulnerability scanners

1133
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,520
things like uh tenable qualis rapid

1134
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
seven and they're great at what they do

1135
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,880
but i guarantee you if you're gonna try

1136
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
to discover iot devices like that it's

1137
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,720
gonna really suck because it's gonna

1138
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,880
knock them over it's gonna mis-identify

1139
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
them if you're lucky it might say oh

1140
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
it's a jet direct interface so it must

1141
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
be a printer but maybe it's not a

1142
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,599
printer maybe it's a jet direct

1143
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,160
interface that's on a mri machine

1144
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,599
right so it doesn't give you the data

1145
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,200
you really need it's just assumption

1146
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
based security so that doesn't work

1147
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
so some people use nbads and bads again

1148
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,240
great solutions on the cyber side but

1149
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,599
when you're talking about these types of

1150
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,040
devices most of the communication is

1151
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,119
encrypted anyhow and you have to have

1152
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,640
spam ports pretty much everywhere in

1153
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
your network to try to capture this

1154
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,200
stuff

1155
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
again you're talking three to five

1156
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
devices per employee ten thousand people

1157
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,720
thirty to fifty thousand devices you're

1158
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
probably not going to have nbad and span

1159
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,760
ports looking at each one of those

1160
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
pieces or if you are you're spending a

1161
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,520
ton of money millions and millions of

1162
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
dollars in switch technology so maybe

1163
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,599
this isn't that big of a problem

1164
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,119
and the other one is traditional asset

1165
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,400
management devices

1166
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
what we find with those however is they

1167
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,599
look at the first uh six octets

1168
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,520
of the mac address so the oui the

1169
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,440
organizationally unique identifier it

1170
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,079
says oh well based on this your hp or

1171
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,520
based on this your

1172
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,119
adele device or based on this your

1173
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,960
wireless access point that doesn't

1174
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,560
really give you the detail we're talking

1175
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,400
about with discovery because if you

1176
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,079
don't get this part right you can't go

1177
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,920
to the more important section which is

1178
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
remediation

1179
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,480
so

1180
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
one of the best ways to approach this

1181
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
i'm going to share some tools with you

1182
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,960
at the end this is a new category so

1183
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,800
it's not a firewall it's not a sim it's

1184
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,960
not a scanner it's called enterprise iot

1185
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
security platforms right this is a

1186
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,720
completely new category and i'll share a

1187
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,160
couple different brands and people that

1188
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,560
do this at the end but the way they work

1189
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,000
is they can integrate with all that old

1190
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
school legacy stuff as well if you want

1191
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
to pull it

1192
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
but in addition to that they can inspect

1193
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
that's like checking out a couple ports

1194
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,079
doing some banner grabs doing light

1195
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,359
stuff that's not going to knock anything

1196
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,359
over and more importantly they do this

1197
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,359
thing called interrogation where they'll

1198
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,280
actually log in if they can authenticate

1199
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,440
or in an unauthenticated way and pull

1200
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
all the data what's your serial number

1201
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,839
what firmware what's your password level

1202
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,599
give me all the context so i know

1203
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,760
exactly what you are and what you do

1204
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
because if i don't have that i'm not a

1205
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
hundred percent accurate i don't want to

1206
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
turn

1207
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,400
my mri device that's two million dollars

1208
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,200
into a 500 hp inkjet

1209
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,119
right if it comes to upgrading firmware

1210
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,319
or something like that later on so

1211
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,720
that's really important and the c3po

1212
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
thing is they remember in star wars

1213
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,839
where i said hey i speak a million

1214
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,040
languages

1215
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,079
iot devices speak so many languages

1216
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
which is why these types of tools these

1217
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
enterprise security platforms are so

1218
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
cool because they can speak all those

1219
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,359
disparate languages for those devices

1220
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,760
and tell you with 100 empirical evidence

1221
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
it's this thing

1222
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
which is very important

1223
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,000
so

1224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,839
i found my devices that's great now

1225
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,839
let's go to the next level which is

1226
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,240
upgrading the firmware and hardening it

1227
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
there's no way to do this manually you

1228
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
can't update all your firmware manually

1229
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
you'd have to have a dedicated team of

1230
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,480
people running around upgrading firmware

1231
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
all day which would be the worst job

1232
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
ever

1233
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
right so you're not going to do that

1234
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
some people say well i'll just stick it

1235
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,720
all behind vlans

1236
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
so that used to be the way people

1237
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,079
approached this years ago we can't fix

1238
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,119
it so we'll put it on a dedicated vlan

1239
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,640
well the problem with that the analogy i

1240
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,079
like to use is let's say you cut your

1241
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
left hand and it's bleeding all over the

1242
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,000
place you need to go to the hospital but

1243
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,359
you don't go to the hospital you stick a

1244
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,800
sandwich bag on it and you wrap it up

1245
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
with duct tape well now you got a bloody

1246
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
hand in a bag and it's not getting blood

1247
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
on your right hand but you still have a

1248
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
hand that's probably going to die and

1249
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,440
fall off on your left hand probably not

1250
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,200
good medical practice

1251
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,720
all it does on a vlan is you're saying

1252
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
i'm taking that thing with the default

1253
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,720
password the end of life firmware all

1254
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,079
the vulnerabilities i'm going to stick

1255
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,200
it over here and hope it doesn't do

1256
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
anything bad

1257
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,440
and to do that at scale

1258
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
it's almost impossible so that's the

1259
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,599
best we had years ago doesn't really

1260
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,160
work today

1261
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,400
so another way to address this is with

1262
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
these tools these security platforms

1263
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
so you can actually get away from

1264
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
assumption based

1265
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,400
and say hey i want to actually know

1266
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,319
exactly what this is

1267
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,640
down to the firmware level so now that i

1268
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,000
can actually upgrade the firmware and

1269
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,920
this is where it gets really cool if a

1270
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,240
device is upgradable over the network

1271
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,960
you can upgrade it with these solutions

1272
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
and you can't just upgrade it but you

1273
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
can also downgrade the firmware

1274
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
so let's talk about upgrade for example

1275
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
first so for example if i'm on version 5

1276
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,640
and i want to get to version 8 you need

1277
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
to know that this you have to follow the

1278
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,560
path of 5 6 7 8

1279
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,640
or this device you can jump right from 5

1280
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,800
to 8. that's why discovery is so

1281
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
important so you can empirically say

1282
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,160
based on evidence this is the firmware

1283
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
this is the device again you don't want

1284
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,319
to turn the mri machine into a printer

1285
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,760
but you also might want to downgrade

1286
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,359
you're on version 5 and it's got a log

1287
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,960
for j and everyone right now is getting

1288
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,599
the internet for log for j

1289
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,280
and the vendor says i know it but i'm

1290
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,640
not going to have a release out for

1291
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,839
three months because i only have two

1292
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,839
developers working on this thing

1293
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,240
so i can back call that to an older

1294
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,560
version if i need to

1295
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,480
without having to go stick a paper clip

1296
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
in something or some other esoteric way

1297
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,400
of doing this you can use these devices

1298
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,480
to upgrade and downgrade

1299
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,160
also hardening something we've been

1300
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,640
doing on it forever cut off my clear

1301
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,440
text protocols no telnet no ftp

1302
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
everything is over https and ssh okay

1303
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
also no bluetooth low energy no

1304
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,920
bluetooth and only wired no wireless

1305
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,760
ethernet and you can push these out

1306
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,520
devices you can push those out across

1307
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,400
the range it makes this scalable now

1308
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,480
when you say i have 10 000 cameras i

1309
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,960
need to upgrade you can actually upgrade

1310
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,640
ten thousand cameras with a click

1311
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
instead of walking out with paper clips

1312
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,520
and trying to do it which means it never

1313
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
gets done it makes this problem tenable

1314
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,800
you can actually manage it now instead

1315
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
of just you know hoping and praying

1316
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
what i had one customer tell me he goes

1317
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
you know when it comes to iot we did

1318
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,920
enough to survive but we didn't do

1319
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,359
enough to matter

1320
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,119
we're absolutely not doing our diligence

1321
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,280
as a security team by ignoring this we

1322
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,920
don't matter

1323
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,240
next thing is credentials inserts right

1324
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,760
just like firmware you're not going to

1325
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
manually go change the passwords or

1326
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
check the certificates on all these

1327
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,880
devices

1328
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,319
there's a lot of great tools out there

1329
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,400
like uh pam tools there's cyber art

1330
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,079
cachy cort vault psychotic all these

1331
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,000
solutions they're great for storing

1332
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
passwords but they don't speak all the

1333
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
iot languages but they can speak to an

1334
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,040
enterprise iot security platform which

1335
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,839
in turn can speak to the iot devices the

1336
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,240
ot devices the network gear and now

1337
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,160
you're not only managing firmware but

1338
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,599
you're also managing passwords and

1339
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,920
you're managing certificates as well

1340
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,200
and you can enforce it you can say you

1341
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,119
know what the password policy is every

1342
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,200
90 days i'm going to rotate has to be

1343
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
long complex passwords or 20 characters

1344
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,119
or more with special characters except

1345
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,800
for all these other devices because

1346
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,319
during the interrogation process you

1347
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,040
know this guy only takes four digit pins

1348
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,599
so maybe we rotate him every three days

1349
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,839
or this guy can't take a password over

1350
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,920
10 characters with special characters

1351
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,839
any little isms that you run across and

1352
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,520
there's some really esoteric stuff out

1353
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,960
there that's weird so you have to have

1354
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,880
that flexibility so you can actually

1355
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,240
leverage your pam tools now your

1356
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,920
identity and access management solutions

1357
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,680
privileged actions management whatever

1358
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,839
you have to manage those credentials and

1359
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,720
furthermore manage the certs

1360
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,040
so now i found my devices

1361
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,440
i fixed the firmware i fixed the

1362
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,040
passwords and i want to make sure

1363
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,440
everything that is fixed stays fixed in

1364
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,119
perpetuity

1365
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,359
so simply monitoring re-interrogating

1366
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,359
these devices on a daily basis to say

1367
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,680
hey this was version seven now it's

1368
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,000
version four it had a really awesome

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
password managed for the pam now it's

1370
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,000
back to a default password so instead of

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
trying to hope my 50 000 devices are

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,640
secure i get an alert through splunk or

1373
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
service now dems titanium whatever

1374
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
telling me hey take a look at these

1375
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,839
devices these are the five you gotta

1376
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,040
look at right now because something

1377
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,040
happened somebody did a paperclip attack

1378
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,400
for example where they reboot the

1379
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,079
machine a lot of these devices have a

1380
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,280
little black button you can hit with the

1381
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,720
paper clip sets it back to factory

1382
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,960
default even the super expensive ntp

1383
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,800
clocks

1384
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,960
and then the last one reporting

1385
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,160
it's great that you've got all these

1386
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,400
capabilities that you can find it you

1387
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
can fix it you can keep it fixed for

1388
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,319
monitoring but if you can't report and

1389
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,240
integrate with all your other cool it

1390
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,119
tools

1391
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,920
it's just some iot management solution

1392
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,440
right so you want to have the ability to

1393
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,640
integrate with all your reporting and

1394
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,839
there's some really good tools that do

1395
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,440
that today

1396
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,800
so in summary

1397
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,160
organizations don't know what they've

1398
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,359
got

1399
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,040
they simply don't have a good handle of

1400
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,960
all the things if they guess they go

1401
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,560
well we got some printers we're not that

1402
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,000
big we don't have that much but when you

1403
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,920
start talking about kvm lights out

1404
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,560
management rack systems etc there's a

1405
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
ton voice over ip phones

1406
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
so they don't know what to fix

1407
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,240
if i don't know what i have i don't know

1408
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,599
what to fix and if i didn't know how to

1409
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,599
fix it i can't fix it at scale because i

1410
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,200
can't have a dedicated team of people

1411
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,359
upgrading firmwares and passwords

1412
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,880
and then if they are fixed they're not

1413
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
monitoring to keep them fixed because

1414
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,680
they don't have any tool to

1415
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,599
reinterrogate these devices without

1416
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,440
knocking them over and killing them to

1417
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,559
make sure that they're still up and

1418
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,760
running

1419
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,440
so that means your iot devices your it

1420
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,359
your ot devices and your network devices

1421
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,400
are insecure

1422
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,720
we talked about ransomware data thefts

1423
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,880
buying destruction all these things that

1424
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,079
they can cause

1425
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,160
and finally there are a few solutions to

1426
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
do this some of these guys have like 30

1427
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,119
day free trials you can play with

1428
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,160
armist nizumi zingbox uh we do these

1429
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,760
things as well everybody has a different

1430
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,839
slice and how they approach it but this

1431
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,400
is the first time there's ever been a

1432
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,960
way to really manage enterprise iot

1433
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,960
devices ot devices and network devices

1434
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,680
at scale when it comes to discovery

1435
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,000
firmware and passwords and it's such a

1436
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
huge hole

1437
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,119
and we talked about frontend the russian

1438
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,960
attacking tool at the beginning that's

1439
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,200
just the one we know about from one

1440
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,760
country that got released to the public

1441
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,880
there's stuff being pumped through

1442
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,200
russia and china and other countries and

1443
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,400
stuff that's being developed here in the

1444
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
us by cyber criminals to engage in

1445
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,640
ransomware campaigns etc that make this

1446
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,359
a really really powerful capability

1447
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,119
if you're spending all your money on it

1448
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,559
security you're not watching these back

1449
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,319
doors they have a direct and immediate

1450
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,960
impact on it and all your data

1451
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
so with that here's my contact

1452
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,119
information my twitter my email and i'll

1453
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,640
take a couple minutes for questions i

1454
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,079
know we we kind of went over right

1455
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,760
because we started a little bit late

1456
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,760
but uh if there's any questions i'll be

1457
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,119
happy to feel them yes sir

1458
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,319
yeah so an iot device from our

1459
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,520
perspective

1460
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,720
is a

1461
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,480
purpose-built device with embedded

1462
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,400
firmware that's connected to the network

1463
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,559
that you can't install an agent on now

1464
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,319
there's lots of other ways to define it

1465
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,160
but when you look at it like that a

1466
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
cisco router

1467
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
scada device all those kind of fall into

1468
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,280
that group

1469
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,160
yep

1470
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,240
sorry apologies we will have to cut it a

1471
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,680
little bit short on the questions just

1472
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,599
to keep things on time make sure we

1473
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,920
don't get too too far off but big round

1474
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,839
of hand thank you brian thanks

1475
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,240
everybody you
