1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,640
so i'm going to say hello besides

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,960
knoxville

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,440
so my song was hello and that was why so

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
anyway uh my name is christine horvega

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
and i've been in knoxville about 11 12

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,440
years now and had an opportunity to work

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
at multiple companies in the area as

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,720
well as

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
in consulting and so currently i'm a

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
director of cyber for cgi and i work

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
with the federal clientele

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
doing cyber advisory and programs so i

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,479
thought this would be fitting i've done

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
cyber programs

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
for over 15 years now and i have worked

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,559
with

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,640
multiple clients

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
and also companies supporting

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
development of metrics development of

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
the program and so one of the things

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
that i typically run into right away is

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
this like aversion to

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
metrics

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,199
this idea that they're hard what are we

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
actually measuring are we going to be

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
you know is it going to count against us

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,520
and so what i will say is not being an

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
engineer by trade or practice um just

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
starts somewhere it just you know that

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
barrier of like we we've got to get

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
everything right it's got to be 100

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
just start somewhere and when you start

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,759
to learn more from the metrics you do

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,680
start with you'll actually start to

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
develop more metrics and it will

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
actually get better over time the other

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
thing is i'll talk about design so

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
that's the other thing is when we talk

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
about you know vulnerabilities you can

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
pull from any system well what are some

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
metrics that i can design and then how

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
do i layer those metrics so that they

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,640
meet the needs of all of my organization

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
i'm not just going to do board reporting

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
or i'm not just going to do business

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,360
unit or even just cyber teams i'm going

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
to look at how do i have metrics across

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,240
my organization so i can support all

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,439
levels

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
and then why those metrics are valuable

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
and what you should be doing with them

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
additionally we'll talk about the

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
program so when i talk about a cyber

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
program i'll actually define it for you

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
but it's really that collection of all

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,439
the initiatives you guys have been here

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
today learning about processes you've

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,960
been learning about tools and

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
technologies

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
when you want to put all of those

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
together you should create this program

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
in order to

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
show that return on investment show how

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
they all help each other out or where

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
security is actually reducing your risk

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
or making your business process more

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
effective or even just

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,640
securing that value of your company that

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
you're trying to build through your

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
devops and then i'll go over some

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
dashboards it's more just for visuals

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
but i will talk about kind of the value

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,519
there and where

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,200
you can differentiate and how you create

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
your dashboard but the real objective

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
here is really to get people past that

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
really the barrier or your hesitation to

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
putting metrics out there

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
metrics are going to help you they're

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
going to

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,480
put your program in play and then also

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
they're going to help you define

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
specific things that you want to measure

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,599
so going back to that cyber program how

85
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,440
many of you out there are currently have

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
a cyber program you may call an

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
information security program

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
at your company and are currently

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
putting together a portfolio projects

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
not very many so that's interesting

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
one of the things that i hope you take

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
away today like i said i do have a whole

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,959
approach i have dashboards i have

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,040
metrics that we've written um or that

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
i've written and put in here please

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,120
reach out to me i'm willing to share

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
everything i have

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
i've been doing this like i said for

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,720
over you know 10 15 years

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
i have a lot of materials

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,000
so cyber program what is that i define

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
it as again it can be an is program it

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,440
can be a cyber security program the

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,959
program itself is really bringing

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
together those initiatives so when you

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
think about people process and

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
technology

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
we have to be able to see how they come

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,319
together

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
we want to measure them from end to end

111
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
and we want to show the value

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
of how those initiatives are really

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
driving towards

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
reducing the risk for the organization

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,480
enabling it to meet its objectives and

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
how security plays into that

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
i typically do not put cyber security

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,879
together right away i like cyber risk

119
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
because i think cyber risk is different

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
it's that probability of the loss or the

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,959
adverse

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
impact event that is going to

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
really prevent you from meeting those

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
bigger objectives it's where's my loss

125
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
of availability confidentiality or

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
integrity for my data systems network

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
processes again that could go on and on

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
whereas security or cyber security

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
security posture is really when i define

130
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
it as the evaluation of how your

131
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
controls

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,919
or your frameworks or your standards how

133
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
are you lining up to what you said you

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,880
were going to do and your expected

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,000
outcomes

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
and typically i will say it is

137
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
compliance related and i will say it

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
that way security is a control function

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
it is set to oversight your i.t

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
activities and your business processes

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,080
so it is typically aligned with a

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
compliance concept

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
this i will show you again some

144
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
different metrics i've seen around that

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,160
are dashboards uh but again i just like

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
to differentiate that because one of the

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
big things that i always

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
come to the table with my leadership is

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
is that you can be secure but not even

150
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
touch the risks that are actually

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
hitting you

152
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
and that's why i say it typically will

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
can align with your compliance programs

154
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,039
now i work with the federal government a

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,000
lot

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,280
and i've also worked with federal

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,919
entities this is typically the case it's

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,400
all it's very focused

159
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
on

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
the compliance the requirements the

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
frameworks whether it's nist

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
whether it's cmmc

163
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,759
how can i meet those requirements and

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
then ultimately it needs to come full

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
circle back to the risk whereas the

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
indicator should help you with that so i

167
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
have performance and risk indicators

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
risk indicators are really letting you

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
know when something's coming at you and

170
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
i always like to give the example of you

171
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
know i drove in this morning lots of

172
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,479
traffic or for those of you in this area

173
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,840
there's lots of traffic i came from the

174
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
dc area that's a joke for traffic um so

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,360
you know i'm coming in and all of a

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
sudden it's jamming up again right as

177
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
i'm coming towards the city and i see

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
the brake lights indicator i need to

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
change my behavior i need to think about

180
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
how i'm going to respond to the traffic

181
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
ahead of me whereas key performance

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
indicators are really about how you're

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
doing so when we talk about program

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
success we're going to talk about those

185
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
performance indicators how do i make

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,479
sure that i know

187
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
i'm meeting the objective or the

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
expected outcome that i have

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
uh and interestingly enough before

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,960
we talked about governance and so the

191
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
previous uh you know the previous

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,600
presenter said okay governance i agree i

193
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
typically live in the governance world

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
but the way i also uh

195
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
talk about is roles and responsibilities

196
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
and different levels of the organization

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
because if you think about your

198
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
strategic level and your board reports

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
your business leader reports and then

200
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
also your cyber reports at your team

201
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
level or even your end user level

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,599
they're all going to be different but

203
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,759
they should be synchronized to again

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
support the bigger objectives of your

205
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,919
company and meet those uh goals and

206
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,758
produce value for the organization

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
so one of the analogies i like to use is

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
i go to the doctor

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
and so if you think about it measuring

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
your vitals is the first thing you do at

211
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
every doctor's appointment you walk in

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,160
you know they say step on the scale my

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
least favorite activity when i get there

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,319
it just brings a downer right up and

215
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,759
then of course they hit my blood

216
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,440
pressure well that's already elevated

217
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
again um and so then they go and check

218
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
you know my temperature in the covered

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,440
days it's getting a little less

220
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
but then they also ask me questions they

221
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
say how are you feeling do you have pain

222
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,080
anywhere so it's really those indicators

223
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
is there potentially something wrong

224
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,720
should they go further test further do

225
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
you think they jump right into hey let's

226
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,039
go do an mri scan let's do a cat scan no

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,840
because one they're expensive two timely

228
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
and three i never have enough time to

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
get to all those different appointments

230
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
so what i like to do is say hey if i

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
have something wrong let me know so how

232
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
is this information being shared with me

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
are we talking you know jumping right

234
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,400
from i have a pain in my back to back

235
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
surgery no it's i'm talking through what

236
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
the implications or what the impact

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
could be what could be causing it and

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
what those root causes are

239
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
and then also thinking about vitals from

240
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
an indicator perspective they should be

241
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
aligned with my objective i'm trying to

242
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
get healthier i'm trying to bring my

243
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
blood pressure down

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
and they also provide context for those

245
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
next steps so my doctor's giving me some

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
activities my all-time favorite is my

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
heart doctor loves to tell me don't eat

248
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
red meat and i said yeah that's never

249
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
gonna happen so i tell him you know i

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
gotta live a little and so he says yeah

251
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
just don't order it then i have to make

252
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
it myself so i try to do that on the

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
grill

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
but that's really where you can kind of

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
set yourself up

256
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
very similar to taking those vitals now

257
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,160
good practices when developing metrics

258
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,080
is really around again the audience

259
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
think about your audience i kind of came

260
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,959
up in the grc world where it was the

261
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
right time right person right metric or

262
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
right information

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
very relevant in that your strategic

264
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
metrics should be saved for those at the

265
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
top the senior leadership your board

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
it's really not going to do a lot of

267
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
good to share those metrics with your

268
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,560
team that's acting on the ground

269
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
thinking okay it's great but what does

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
that mean to me so your operational

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
metrics you're really looking at that's

272
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
where it starts to get into the

273
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
processes and the technologies what's

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
that interaction how can i change that

275
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
interaction

276
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
and then your tactical again your

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
outcomes of your staffs and they're

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
going to be outcome driven they're going

279
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
to tie back but they're going to be

280
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
relevant for that you know tactical

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
everyday day-to-day what do you need me

282
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
to do

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
now your metrics my all-time favorite is

284
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,519
need to have decisions or actions

285
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
i always used to ask my clients you're

286
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
going to have to gather all this data

287
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,519
we're going to put these metrics

288
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,720
together what are you doing about it and

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
like what do you mean well you're not

290
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,519
gonna make a decision you're not gonna

291
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,120
change what you're doing

292
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,560
oh no i just wanna know what's happened

293
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
no that that just takes time and energy

294
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
that no one has if you're not gonna

295
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
change anything or you're not gonna make

296
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
a decision or change your actions

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
then you really need to think about that

298
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
metric and step back for a minute and

299
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
say okay what can i actually measure

300
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
that i can then do something with

301
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
also operational improvements or revenue

302
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,079
gains so going back to that value if

303
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
you're going to add value but again it's

304
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,800
about how will i respond or will i

305
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
respond if you're not willing to respond

306
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,279
to any of those metrics don't measure

307
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
them right away work on other ones that

308
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
actually give you some action

309
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
and then i love my favorite is keep

310
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
current or don't bother um people tend

311
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
to just keep running metrics and running

312
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
metrics or my all-time favorite was the

313
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
board reporting we'd spend two weeks

314
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
putting the metrics together and they'd

315
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
already be two weeks old so as we're

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
putting the slides together like what

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,959
are you supposed to do with that

318
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
information um you can't act upon it

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
it's already old so keep it relevant and

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
that's helpful

321
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
so as i was talking about the

322
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
organization those roles and

323
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
responsibilities one of the things you

324
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
want to do is communicate right up front

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
what are the layers now these are three

326
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
layers and i'll show you where i got my

327
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
reference from after but these are

328
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
typically the three layers you see and

329
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
it talks about the different levels of

330
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
metrics that you should be thinking

331
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,399
about for the that specific group so if

332
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,680
you're talking about your boarding

333
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
executives they want to know what your

334
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
risks are what are the risks to those

335
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
objectives that's the real focus but

336
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
also that cyber program approach they

337
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
want to say overarching what are you

338
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
addressing what are your initiatives and

339
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
where's the spend going

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
going back to the business or going down

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,360
to the business leader level you're

342
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
really looking at that overall state one

343
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
of the things i always like to say about

344
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,440
business leader metrics it goes back to

345
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
where where's the money it's the show me

346
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
the money what are you spending money on

347
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,279
what are you measuring when you do that

348
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
because that's what they care about they

349
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,040
often hold the dollars and they'll put

350
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
the money where it matters

351
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
and that's where you get into your risk

352
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,839
treatment actions or your plans your

353
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,200
business plans

354
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
your operational team level metrics

355
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
that's going to again go back to that

356
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
day-to-day tactical they're going to

357
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
want to know where those kris are what

358
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
am i looking for what's my triggers

359
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
where do i need to

360
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
either alert someone escalate

361
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,760
what's important to then measure and

362
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
roll up or what do i need to be aware of

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,519
if i need to change my behavior set an

364
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,360
incident response in place those are

365
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
those kind of metrics you want to have

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
at that team level and i get this from

367
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,760
and i i find the most

368
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
valuable that i've used and i've seen

369
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,200
is the nist cyber security framework

370
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,519
this is their outline of what it looks

371
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
like to do you know an organizational

372
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,680
tiered approach of building metrics

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
communicating and then working through a

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
cyber program

375
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,639
i have seen this work in every instance

376
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
i've looked at you can take the nist off

377
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
it but in the end this csf they give the

378
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
whole outline they help you identify

379
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
those roles and responsibilities and

380
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
they really show you how this comes

381
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
together from a communication

382
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
perspective

383
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
so now talking about cascading what does

384
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
this actually look like so you're

385
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
telling me okay i have all these metrics

386
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,160
great idea so i'm saying okay

387
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
operational metrics i'm going to look at

388
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
a leading metric

389
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,839
and i'm going to cascade it down so my

390
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,680
executive management

391
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
the policy adherence reduces risk of

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
exploitation of critical assets so i'm

393
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
going to look at policy adherence that's

394
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
going to be my metric for them how many

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
times do i see

396
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
that if i'm at a business unit level i

397
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
have number of policy exceptions

398
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
now i got to tie those policy exceptions

399
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,279
so

400
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
so what you have the exceptions we all

401
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,639
have them i know we used to get carried

402
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
away with ours

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
and then you have to look at it related

404
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
to your number of issues because if

405
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
you're having issues in those same areas

406
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
that you have the policy exception

407
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
you really want to start to look at

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,839
should i be accepting that or should i

409
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,240
be changing my risk tolerance or should

410
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
i be thinking about that metric or that

411
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,839
policy a little different and maybe

412
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,120
update it

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
one of the things i always like to tell

414
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
again my clients or even my

415
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
business leaders when i worked with them

416
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
i'd say so we have a policy we're

417
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
getting to a point where it's about

418
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
every third interaction with this policy

419
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
works we're giving exceptions

420
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
after about the first year of that

421
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
shouldn't we just review the policy and

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
update it to think about those

423
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
exceptions and maybe add them and then

424
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,760
we're not doing so many exceptions and i

425
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,959
was like oh you know that's really a

426
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,639
good idea maybe i should do that so

427
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
again measuring it gives you an action

428
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
you can then think about to move forward

429
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
and then of course you have your cyber

430
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,839
ops team so those policy exceptions

431
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,040
they're going to be looking for those

432
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,399
security alerts they're going to be

433
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,079
looking at those specific assets and

434
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,839
where that policy is tied in because

435
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,839
they're going to feed into your issues

436
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,120
they're also going to be looking at the

437
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
percent of critical assets that are

438
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
assessed with deficiencies that's

439
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
typically where you're going to see your

440
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,240
issues if you have deficiencies you're

441
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
going to see issues if you have

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
exceptions then you're going to see lack

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,079
of policy adherence you're definitely

444
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,360
going to see

445
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
increased risk in that area so this ties

446
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
back to an asset a process

447
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
and again a network or even a

448
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
transaction that's going on so these are

449
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
the like i said the build up of a or a

450
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,320
built down of a metric that then helps

451
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
everyone in the organization understand

452
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,040
where the risk is and also where they

453
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,000
can be more secure

454
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
so i'm going to go into cyber program

455
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
and the metrics that go with it but i'm

456
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,839
going to start off with the program so

457
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
what does a program look like now again

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
very generic uh you don't have to start

459
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
off with as much detail but this really

460
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
goes back to what's the program and

461
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
these are typically security programs or

462
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
it programs and then what's the

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,199
objective so going back to your

464
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,600
organizational capability going back to

465
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
what it ties to make your organization

466
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,800
successful think about your objectives

467
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
because again that will help you set up

468
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
what's the metric what's a really

469
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,000
valuable metric to ensure i'm meeting

470
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that objective and that it ties back to

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,560
my organizational value now you can also

472
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
see that we do have training and

473
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
awareness so your people side you've got

474
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
your data security and management asset

475
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,959
inventory you've got your technology and

476
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
then we typically have a process a

477
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
configuration or patch change control

478
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
you're going to look at those processes

479
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
so you're trying to capture a little or

480
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
one or two of each so that you make sure

481
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
you measure all aspects of your program

482
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
now this isn't a full one but again

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
making it so it can fit on the slide you

484
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
can build it out you can build it less

485
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
making it readable for you is much more

486
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
important to me at the time

487
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,199
so this is the approach and i've

488
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
actually used this approach i've

489
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,839
implemented it and i've seen it work

490
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
one of the things that i would say when

491
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,240
it comes to building any approach or any

492
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
program is consistency one people

493
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,199
understand what what the expectation is

494
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
you know when things are happening and

495
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
you can reiterate and do continuous

496
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,679
improvement when you follow an approach

497
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,439
and it's standardized so you're going to

498
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
look at identi when you identify you're

499
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,799
going to look at your wrists so we

500
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
talked about the risk to the

501
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,919
organization now this is not going to be

502
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
the risk that your you know your patch

503
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
management program isn't working that's

504
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,240
not this risk this risk is what does it

505
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
mean if i have infiltration into my or i

506
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
have exploitation of a system and

507
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
somebody comes in and infiltrates my

508
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
network takes my pii or

509
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,799
gets into my bank accounts or my banks

510
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,960
or my financial statements that's the

511
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,559
kind of risk we're really looking for is

512
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
how am i going to impact my organization

513
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
and from there you'll build the metrics

514
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,360
through those business objectives you're

515
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
going to tie the two together you're

516
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,120
going to understand at a strategic level

517
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,720
or through your senior leaders which

518
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,559
they typically roll down

519
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
what are we really trying to do this

520
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
year

521
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
and i thought it was interesting that

522
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
the earlier one i've actually worked

523
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
with brian saylor i was on the security

524
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,039
team for his organization at the time um

525
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,080
and i did cyber programs um one of the

526
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
things that i found interesting was this

527
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,960
idea that security um you know i said to

528
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
him after security actually protects the

529
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
value too because you can say that you

530
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
know well i couldn't get my um

531
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,320
i couldn't get my app out or i couldn't

532
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
get that specific service out yes but if

533
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
it went out it's unsecure and somebody

534
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
comes in and you have the you know you

535
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
basically have reputational risk you

536
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
have uh which then gets to your

537
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
shareholders or you have strategic risk

538
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,480
where they shut down entire services

539
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
those are things you have to think about

540
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
from a security side and it's not that

541
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
we're trying to inhibit we're really

542
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
trying to think about how do you protect

543
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,799
at the same time and it is a balance

544
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
that you have to find so anyway

545
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
so looking at design you're really going

546
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
to then go into what are my key

547
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,919
indicators so we talked about key

548
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
indicators and the big thing here is

549
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,960
you're going to put those indicators

550
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
across against a business process or

551
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
again a capability a tool and the reason

552
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
being is because you're going to watch

553
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
that target so you're going to set upper

554
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
and lower spec limits you're going to

555
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,080
have a threshold or you're going to have

556
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,240
something like a trigger and when those

557
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,799
are hit that says oh too risky i have

558
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,120
too many exceptions to this policy i've

559
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
got multiple issues

560
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
you know all my alarms are going off my

561
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,400
risk is too high i need to adjust that

562
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,799
then allows you to go into those

563
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,240
treatments so

564
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
when you think about the targets that's

565
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,240
really about that where do you live and

566
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
where do you want to live or what's

567
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
making you uncomfortable i always find

568
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
that when i worked with executives they

569
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
never wanted to do risk appetite it was

570
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
like the most painful exercise we would

571
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,919
go through why because i don't want to

572
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,960
commit to that what happens if we

573
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
actually hit it what happens if

574
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
everything goes wrong yeah what if you

575
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,799
tell somebody you never actually paid

576
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
attention to it that's even worse

577
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,520
because you've actually seen companies

578
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
crash over that so i think that's one of

579
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
those things is you set the targets and

580
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
again they're not set in stone you can

581
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
do ranges if it makes someone feel

582
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,440
better

583
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
um it's really just about giving you

584
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,799
that comfort level like when are you

585
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,880
gonna start not being able to sleep at

586
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
night when do you want me to escalate to

587
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
you that's your target

588
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
and then data collection and automation

589
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
so we did talk about automation also

590
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
and one of the things with data

591
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
collection is

592
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,280
get a single source of the truth one of

593
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
the things i found during grcu pro

594
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
projects and implementations of big data

595
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
you have to have a single source of the

596
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
truth and you have to define it ahead of

597
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
time then you can automate it pull it

598
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
and you're always talking the same and

599
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
one of the examples i always give i

600
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,039
worked for a large energy company 21

601
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,520
billion you know we were trading at 100

602
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
we were doing awesome um we were doing

603
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
data collection one day and they said

604
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
okay how much energy do we produce

605
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
and four people answered and they were

606
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
all different answers and we said well

607
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
how could that be you know how are you

608
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
saying we produce different levels of

609
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,840
energy like don't we have certain assets

610
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
one number

611
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
oh no we produce energy at the

612
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,600
so if you defined it as where total

613
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,840
production at the source that was one

614
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,720
number

615
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,559
well then it's well how much did we use

616
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,320
and how much do we actually have at the

617
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
hub to sell because that's actually more

618
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,720
important revenue is always important

619
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,559
so that was another number and so we

620
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
just kept going through this exercise

621
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,559
and eventually we said okay we need to

622
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,039
define when we say in the room

623
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,919
especially when we're doing board and um

624
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,919
credit agency reporting we're like what

625
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,320
is the number and how are we defining it

626
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
very good point to data collection so

627
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
that you know where to draw it from and

628
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
you know what to bound your data at and

629
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,520
you're not just capturing everything

630
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,600
and from there of course my favorite is

631
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
take action you're either going to treat

632
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
the risk and again you can avoid it you

633
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,799
can mitigate it

634
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,919
and then you're going to look at

635
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,840
performance management and that's where

636
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
you have those actions what does that

637
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
plan look like what are my controls

638
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
how am i going to respond to that

639
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,039
whether it's going by another cyber

640
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
security tool i say that because we

641
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
usually have anywhere from 20 to 40 at

642
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
other organizations or it's going and

643
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
putting a process in place or a

644
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
management tool

645
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
and again i always like to give a

646
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
practical exercise one of my favorites

647
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
is unauthorized access to pii

648
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,720
um your risk example and i am a

649
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
traditionalist a risk is something

650
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,200
that's against an asset that's a threat

651
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
it's a vulnerability it's an impact like

652
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
risk is not

653
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,039
the internet well what about the

654
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
internet everybody uses it is it really

655
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,440
a risk it's the cyber threat exploits my

656
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
vulnerability to gain access to my

657
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
system unauthorized access

658
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,679
my root causes so going back to thinking

659
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,679
about what's causing that or what what

660
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
those actions are you're looking at my

661
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
patches weren't conducted so that's

662
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,440
again a security it's a it's a control

663
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
because patching and that program is a

664
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,039
control but also my system

665
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
vulnerabilities remain unaddressed what

666
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,640
i always try to

667
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
bring to the table as the oversight

668
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
security oversight with this patching

669
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,799
and vulnerability program is

670
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,520
you don't only patch vulnerabilities so

671
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,039
what are the other treatments we could

672
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,480
do so you didn't patch it what else

673
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
could we do

674
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
that can reduce it as well that can

675
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
mitigate so those are things you need to

676
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
think about and then of course our kris

677
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,080
is patch latency time frames you're

678
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
looking at high risk vulnerabilities

679
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,559
over 30 days

680
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,320
your percent of vulnerability is not

681
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
addressed so the again these are going

682
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
to give you indications that something's

683
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,760
not going right you're not following

684
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
your controls you're not following your

685
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
policy

686
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,039
and eventually you're going to have to

687
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,960
look at what's going on in your

688
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
organization and do you have to change

689
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,840
your program

690
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
so bringing it all full circle you're

691
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
going to look at what is my program or

692
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,000
what is my initiative what's my

693
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
objective

694
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,000
what's my risk to that

695
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
specific program or objective or the

696
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
organization and then look at the

697
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
metrics in alignment with that now i've

698
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
added the maturity model and this one is

699
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
the nist csf

700
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,159
you can pick any of them i've worked in

701
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,480
the iso i've worked in cobit cmmc

702
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,480
i've worked in nist 800 and miss csf so

703
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
they all come together and they're very

704
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
similar what you're going to want to do

705
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
is look at that maturity model or that

706
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
category and the reason being is one you

707
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
want to see that you spread it out you

708
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,919
don't want to only do protect you don't

709
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,240
only want to live in one area it goes

710
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
back to people process technology and

711
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,559
ensure that you spread out your program

712
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
so that you're addressing all the areas

713
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
at least once

714
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,400
that ensures that you have a holistic

715
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,799
program

716
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
so now i'll go into some cyber program

717
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,080
dashboards

718
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,400
i'm a visual person and so one of the

719
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
things that i used to develop a lot of

720
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
was these dashboards i do like bi

721
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,159
products today they're much better

722
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,840
but what you can see is a control

723
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
catalog and again going back to that

724
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
security posture and the security

725
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,640
dashboards what i typically have seen

726
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
and what comes up is well how is my

727
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
controls doing based on what i expected

728
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
it for the outcome how am i measuring

729
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
them what's the maturity of them how are

730
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
they um are they doing what i think

731
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
they're doing and again being secure is

732
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
good but it doesn't mean you're

733
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
addressing all your risks which is why

734
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,919
it's important to go back to risks and

735
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
objectives and understanding how that

736
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,799
ties back

737
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
and then of course you have the cyber

738
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,960
program security posture this has the

739
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,600
people process and technology piece it

740
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,080
has some risk ratings it has some you

741
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
know patch programs so it's really

742
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,120
capturing

743
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
all angles of that

744
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
prospect of well i have

745
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,159
a program or i have an initiative going

746
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
i'm spending on this program i have all

747
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
the people lined up i have all my

748
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
policies in place i know what my

749
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
requirements are now i just need to

750
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,799
measure and make sure that i'm living

751
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,640
where i feel comfortable

752
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
and i always like to have the green

753
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,480
yellow red because what i say is if you

754
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
know the days of when socks first came

755
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,120
out as in sarbanes-oxley you know that

756
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
companies actually got hurt financially

757
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,919
by trying to implement every

758
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
control at a hundred percent of the time

759
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
it's not possible you have to make

760
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,159
decisions about where your security is

761
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
sometimes going to have to linger a

762
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,640
little bit where you can't spend but

763
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
what are some other controls or what are

764
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
some other processes you can put in

765
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,840
place

766
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
but this is where i always do the green

767
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
yellow red and we have orange on this

768
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
one and those triggers are really there

769
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,840
and the trending's there because you

770
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,960
really want to monitor it because

771
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
sometimes you can actually live in the

772
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,799
orange and you don't trigger until it

773
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,480
trends upward and then you're like okay

774
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
now we can't take on any more risk but

775
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
we could live in the orange for a little

776
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,559
while and that actually helps with that

777
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,760
action

778
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
return on investment and also the

779
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,679
decisions

780
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
but going back to our risk dashboard now

781
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
why i say this is this has all of my

782
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,520
cyber program on and why this is a

783
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
little different than if i had a cyber

784
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,760
program or a security dashboard versus

785
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,840
risk is it's actually about the status

786
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,480
of these so each of these programs is

787
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
actually addressing an objective so if i

788
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
see that i'm not

789
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,799
meeting those greens for my program and

790
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,720
the outcomes of those that's when i see

791
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
risk escalating because i'm not going to

792
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,799
meet the end of my implementation or i'm

793
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
not going to put that

794
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
specific technology in place which then

795
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
doesn't allow me to meet my objectives

796
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,159
and i may take on risks that i didn't

797
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,840
know so that's why i see that as a

798
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
little different than what i had before

799
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
when i said it was and similar things

800
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,200
were in a security dashboard um

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
additionally you have that program risk

802
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
dashboard risks is vulnerabilities plus

803
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,399
threats plus assets so if you know what

804
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
your assets are so going back to

805
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,640
inventory knowing what you have

806
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,559
knowing what's happening to them and

807
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,919
understanding the threats that are

808
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
coming at you in that probability

809
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,360
much better chance of catching or

810
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
mitigating the right risk and ensuring

811
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,720
that you protect the value of your

812
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
organization

813
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,159
going into policies and standards that's

814
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
again their governance side but ensuring

815
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,039
that you're following uh your direction

816
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,919
policies should be based around not only

817
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,200
the requirements from a legal

818
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
perspective or a regulatory perspective

819
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,880
but also from an organizational

820
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,480
perspective and then you have training

821
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
and awareness again the people you

822
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
always want to focus on your people

823
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,279
and config management i have in there

824
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,240
so some things to avoid

825
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
using metrics that no one understands

826
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,080
there's there's no point and just you

827
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
could have the greatest metric in the

828
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,960
world and you put it up there and

829
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,000
everyone's like i don't know why we're

830
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,039
measuring that i don't know what it

831
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,320
means

832
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,679
that's where you start to lose people

833
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,600
and they lose that

834
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,520
understanding and also buy in for those

835
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
metrics

836
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
cluttering up your dashboard and your

837
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
report with low value graphics

838
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
less is always more when it comes to

839
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
reporting and dashboards especially if

840
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
you want decisions and action

841
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
um failing to match the the metrics to

842
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
your goals so going back to what i said

843
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
where you're measuring something but you

844
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
never plan to do anything about it

845
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,080
you're just again taking up a lot of

846
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,960
time and effort it's not uh valuable to

847
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
anyone and then too much dependency on

848
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
words a lot of people you got to have

849
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,399
the words but you really do have to

850
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,039
focus visually because you're trying to

851
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,760
cater to audiences that one some people

852
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,320
learn or capture by audio some are

853
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,520
visual

854
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,440
and some are i have to do it i have to

855
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,799
understand what you're saying or i have

856
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,159
to see it done and that's why i always

857
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
like to have my examples up here so you

858
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,679
can tell i've done a lot of training

859
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,760
especially adult ed you have to hit all

860
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,559
those aspects

861
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
and so implementing the approach i

862
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,120
wanted to go through kind of my story

863
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
i worked through or my experience i've

864
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,320
worked at a local company here

865
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
which since uh i actually did this

866
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,159
program has uh

867
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,399
changed over i will say and one of the

868
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,000
things that i did when i came into the

869
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
program so i worked for the cso and the

870
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,640
cto and i supported the cio

871
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
but the cso was really my driver so i

872
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
worked for him and he said i'm trying to

873
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
put the niscsf program in place

874
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,840
and as i'm putting this program in place

875
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
i'm thinking about all the things that i

876
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
need to do we want to do all of these

877
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,039
programs but i don't have any regulatory

878
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,399
drivers

879
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,000
and i don't really have as much buy-in

880
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
as i would like because they don't see

881
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,720
the value of security in a non-regulated

882
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,600
very open creative environment so let's

883
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
talk about those business objectives

884
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
ends what's a value to the organization

885
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,679
that we could define our program around

886
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,240
our maturity and then what were the key

887
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,799
risks to that organization so we started

888
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,720
there we put together we took the

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,559
objectives we sat down with the cio and

890
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,279
cto we said what's important what should

891
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,279
we be bringing to you from

892
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
you know where do you want to make a

893
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
difference what kind of technologies are

894
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
we thinking and so we started to map

895
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
some of those out and think about the

896
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,840
problem we were trying to solve so we

897
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,919
defined the problem we looked at what

898
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,080
the objectives were and we identified

899
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,559
the macro risks

900
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,080
we then went into implement so we

901
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,840
started to implement some initiatives

902
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,440
and actually you saw

903
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,640
multiple

904
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,399
dashboards that we used and that was

905
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
actually our program dashboard we

906
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,080
started to look at where the focus was

907
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,200
so we identified that we had a lot of um

908
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,120
un

909
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,279
unsupported technologies

910
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,360
out of date versions and we realized we

911
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,039
did we weren't patching as much as we

912
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,039
should be and our vulnerabilities were

913
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,360
really our greatest or our weakest link

914
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,200
at the time so we started to look at

915
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,039
those initiatives where you saw patch

916
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,679
management configuration management

917
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,600
and then we also identified that we you

918
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,240
know fishing was becoming very uh

919
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,720
significant for us we'd actually had two

920
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,399
incidents that occurred where somebody

921
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,480
had been phished through an email and it

922
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
opened us up

923
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
and we'd actually had money transacted

924
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
so those were things okay we need to do

925
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
training and awareness we need to make

926
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
sure that everyone understands

927
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,039
that this is something that's going on

928
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,880
whether it's fishing whaling you know

929
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,120
any kind of social engineering that was

930
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,519
happening so we went over all of that

931
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,360
and we put that in place as well but

932
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
then we had to define those metrics and

933
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,559
say what was going to be valuable to

934
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,799
show success for our program

935
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,760
we did use the nist csf we did look at

936
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
the maturity model we had a third party

937
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,880
come in they assessed us

938
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
and then we continued to use that

939
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
assessment are those the context of

940
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
those questions and outcomes as well as

941
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
what nist csf controls were uh trying to

942
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
achieve and then we would measure them

943
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
periodically usually quarterly

944
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
go out we'd assess it

945
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
we'd ask questions we'd make sure some

946
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,360
things were in line with where we

947
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
expected them and then ultimately were

948
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
able to create metrics

949
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,799
we made sure they were in line again

950
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,320
with our maturity or with our business

951
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
objectives and those risks that we had

952
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,919
identified

953
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,760
so then we decided to measure

954
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,840
once we decided to measure and set up

955
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,519
our metrics we said what are the data

956
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,840
sources how can we automate this how can

957
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
we put this into place and so then we

958
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
were able to develop our dashboard now

959
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
we did do a color-coded dashboard at one

960
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,039
point

961
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,000
that's the one you saw with the

962
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,039
stoplight that was our very high level

963
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
this is how our program's going this is

964
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
where our risk is

965
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
and things that we would actually

966
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
propose for

967
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,039
you know spending or a add-on to the

968
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,039
initiative or something that would we

969
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,760
had to change our plan was not working

970
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,440
one of the things that we did do is we

971
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,760
were at uh interestingly enough when we

972
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
finished the first assessment we were

973
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,559
like a two out of five for the nist csf

974
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
it was it's not a good day but we said

975
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,919
you know we don't have any regulatory

976
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,440
requirements we're going to put some

977
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,399
stuff in place we're going to start

978
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,919
paying more attention

979
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,159
we started to automate and we started to

980
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,640
act we started to change the behavior we

981
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
set up those governance groups we had

982
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,799
regular meetings we talked about what

983
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,960
was working and what wasn't working we

984
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,640
talked about what we needed support from

985
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
the it sections

986
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,159
we talked about the business leaders

987
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,679
what they needed to be thinking about

988
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,039
and how they were supporting these

989
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,519
metrics as well and we also talked about

990
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,519
where they were getting reported um

991
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,519
you'd be surprised what the driver or

992
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,960
the change in behavior is when you're

993
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,399
like yeah this is getting reported to

994
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,919
the executive committee and the board

995
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,440
and they're asking these questions and

996
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
this is what they want to know about

997
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
all of a sudden everybody parks up oh

998
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,039
well let me let me change my behavior a

999
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,159
little bit because i want to make sure i

1000
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,159
look good when you put that on paper so

1001
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,359
those are things that changes that

1002
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,280
behavior because what gets measured gets

1003
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,159
done

1004
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,440
is i learned that back in the six

1005
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,520
segment days uh and then what we did was

1006
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,119
we continuously improved you know we

1007
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,280
realized where we were not doing well or

1008
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,879
where something was working or wasn't

1009
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,280
working and we changed we changed the

1010
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,879
plan we said no we're going to move

1011
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,560
we're going to put more emphasis on

1012
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,159
patch management we're going to really

1013
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,879
buckle down on it we ended up in 18

1014
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,040
months moving from a two i think it was

1015
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
a 2.1 overall

1016
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
up to a 2.9

1017
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,000
and we actually saw an increase in our

1018
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
maturity as well as a secure posture but

1019
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,879
we knew our risk better and we were

1020
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
managing them better

1021
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
so key takeaways measure what matters

1022
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,280
again what gets measured gets done if

1023
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
it's not actionable don't measure it

1024
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
make relevant at all the levels i showed

1025
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
you how to kind of cascade it down why

1026
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
it's relevant to talk to each level of

1027
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
your organization and ultimately at the

1028
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
bottom it helps them understand how

1029
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
they're helping the organization achieve

1030
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
its objectives and be part of the bigger

1031
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,440
team

1032
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,359
especially if you're bonusing that's

1033
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,720
always a biggie

1034
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,359
tied to initial objectives going back to

1035
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,119
what's the value add for the

1036
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,040
organization and the business and how is

1037
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
their revenue being generated and how

1038
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,880
are you protecting it how are you

1039
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
thinking about it and then how are you

1040
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,440
measuring your success to align to that

1041
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
and then make it a journey and not a

1042
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
destination cyber programs should always

1043
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,359
be moving they should always be flexing

1044
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,920
we know our threats change i think you

1045
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,160
know as you think about solarwinds log

1046
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,720
4j all of those things were surprises in

1047
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,760
a sense we have to be able to change and

1048
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,240
your program will give you that idea of

1049
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,839
one what you're measuring but how you

1050
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,160
can make those changes

1051
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
more easily how you're documenting them

1052
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,320
and actually see how they all tie

1053
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,079
together to make your organization more

1054
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,720
successful

1055
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,400
so i'm going to take questions comments

1056
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,000
yes

1057
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,960
um

1058
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,920
on page nine

1059
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,200
gonna make me

1060
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,359
is

1061
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,040
so

1062
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,720
if you think about oh it does thank you

1063
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
based on my program where would

1064
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,560
anti-virus fit would it fit under patch

1065
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,480
management and i would say

1066
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
this goes back to what are you

1067
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,960
ultimately trying to measure

1068
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
the question that was the question

1069
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,720
i'm sorry

1070
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
sorry that's okay

1071
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
um i would say that this goes back to

1072
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,560
how you define it now from an antivirus

1073
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
i wouldn't necessarily say that fits

1074
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
under patch management patch management

1075
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,160
was more about when you have those open

1076
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,599
vulnerabilities are you moving them

1077
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,280
through faster do you have unsupported

1078
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
systems but antivirus would be a subsidy

1079
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
or like a subs uh sorry a secondary uh

1080
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,480
control that could take the place or

1081
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
help out if you're not doing something

1082
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,720
just like protecting or taking a system

1083
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
offline or an application that again

1084
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
wasn't being secure so you have to

1085
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,280
define what falls into those areas and

1086
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,760
it's not prescriptive in that sense

1087
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,680
as you think about the nist controls

1088
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
though yes they will actually tell you

1089
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,800
where all that lives they'll tell you it

1090
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
lives and protect or it lives in the

1091
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,480
nist um 853 series you know it lives in

1092
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,960
you know this specific program

1093
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
so i think from that perspective it goes

1094
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
back to your framework and it would tie

1095
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,920
back to your control structure you want

1096
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,119
to use

1097
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,640
but at the same time this is an

1098
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
opportunity that you define that and you

1099
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,599
scope it for the organization

1100
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,880
yes um

1101
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
do you

1102
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,520
suggest or have any advice regarding

1103
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,560
tooling that maps controls to so we need

1104
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
my organization here's the high trust

1105
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,720
and so if you're potentially going to be

1106
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
located

1107
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
yes i've actually done high trust and it

1108
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
was on rsams

1109
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,160
but what i can say is yes your grc tools

1110
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,839
that's the intent they're they're

1111
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,560
intended to set it up um so it really

1112
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
goes back to

1113
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
many of the tools are the same now and

1114
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,520
just a little twist

1115
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,680
because they are doing a standard

1116
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,520
approach and they actually

1117
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,760
they started back in like 2005 2006

1118
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,359
really becoming popular the first one i

1119
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,320
did was 2007. uh what you're really

1120
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
doing there is mapping those controls to

1121
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
your policies and your standards

1122
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,440
requirements

1123
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
and then ultimately looking at your

1124
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,440
risks so the tools themselves are

1125
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,359
actually set up that way it's actually a

1126
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,040
category or

1127
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,839
a

1128
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,960
alignment uh tearing it up so you'd have

1129
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,400
your what's my regulatory requirements

1130
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,079
and then you would look at what my

1131
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,520
standards and framework is and then you

1132
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,880
put your controls so you can actually

1133
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,400
see how they then tie back to your

1134
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,200
assets third parties business process um

1135
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
and then you would tie risk to them so

1136
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,960
it actually is a full circle and that's

1137
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
their relational databases so they

1138
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,919
actually do map for you

1139
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,320
yes highly recommend it you what we

1140
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,079
found um actually as a client

1141
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,320
we did our like i said in 2007 i did my

1142
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
first grc implementation we were able to

1143
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,320
reduce our controls by 40

1144
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,079
overnight because we realized we were

1145
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,599
duplicating

1146
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,280
multiple organizations our business

1147
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,200
units were doing the same control just a

1148
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,960
little different but we were ultimately

1149
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,400
meeting the same objective so we just

1150
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
started doing control objectives

1151
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
and then we would

1152
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,400
basically control once satisfy many and

1153
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
so you will find that it's very

1154
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,440
efficient if you are able to map it

1155
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,539
[Music]

1156
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,440
so

1157
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
i'm going to reiterate the question

1158
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,520
because i did forget yours um the

1159
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
drivers of the metrics um so what are

1160
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,800
some

1161
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,520
uh again i would look at the from a

1162
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
driver's perspective going back to your

1163
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,760
root causes um and sorry i'll just go

1164
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,560
back to i'm gonna

1165
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,280
i have to make sure i know where i am

1166
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,359
nope it was down um so you're gonna look

1167
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,359
at what your root causes were you're

1168
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,720
gonna look at what your targets are or

1169
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,240
your business capabilities that you want

1170
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,680
to build um you're going to look at

1171
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,599
your objectives you always want to make

1172
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
sure that you're thinking about what

1173
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
your objective is but one of the big

1174
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
ones is for instance like your wrist so

1175
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
you want to look at your macro drivers

1176
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
as well as your micro but when i talk

1177
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
macro you know if i'm in a

1178
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
transportation company or transportation

1179
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
business where my product is either on

1180
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,760
the ground or i've got to move it and

1181
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,200
you're thinking about what's going on

1182
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
you know even overseas in ukraine or the

1183
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
middle east and our policies and how

1184
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
those cast out cascade and impact

1185
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,119
certain things in the united states

1186
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
those are going to be risks that you

1187
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,680
want to think about so then you want to

1188
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,359
think about what my objectives if i'm

1189
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,599
trying to earn more money and bring down

1190
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,760
the cost of my products well then the

1191
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,680
root cause is going to be i need to

1192
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,280
think through some of those policy

1193
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,720
implications that are going to come to

1194
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,960
me and then how do i put specific um

1195
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
and that's more of a i know it's more of

1196
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,640
a transfer from a cyber perspective i

1197
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,880
can go back to that one or from a cyber

1198
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
program i.t side you're going to look at

1199
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,960
again russia is trying to infiltrate

1200
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,480
a lot of companies so if you know you're

1201
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
on one of their high value tax

1202
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
how high value target lists one of the

1203
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,000
things you're going to want to do is

1204
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
look out for that so you're going gonna

1205
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
probably up your scanning you're gonna

1206
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
maybe purchase another tool or have a

1207
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,960
you know a service put in place a

1208
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
managed service that helps you look for

1209
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,839
that

1210
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,520
again dealing with the federal agencies

1211
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,880
that's one of the things that we have to

1212
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,520
think about when we propose our cyber

1213
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
programs to them is how do they think

1214
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,319
through

1215
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,160
you know additional

1216
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
nation states coming after them or what

1217
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,160
might be happening because certain

1218
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,640
people have taken on you know

1219
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,160
an aggressive stance

1220
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,920
robin

1221
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,920
christina

1222
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,640
i would love to hear just a few of your

1223
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
tips and tricks about

1224
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,280
how do you explain

1225
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,079
how do you translate for them

1226
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,400
what should i worry about this posture

1227
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
the definition of risk posture and

1228
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,319
appropriateness right if that balance

1229
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,900
right between

1230
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,989
[Music]

1231
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
so i would say that

1232
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,640
some of the best conversations one uh oh

1233
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,280
so how i've worked for multiple c-suite

1234
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,040
um in fact i worked with robin and we

1235
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,720
both worked for the cso and cto um and

1236
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,880
how do i

1237
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
put that conversation in real context

1238
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,800
for the higher levels and make it more

1239
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,119
of a strategic conversation and they can

1240
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,400
understand it

1241
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,079
and i would say one of the things i do

1242
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,520
is i typically tend to roll things up so

1243
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,040
going back to this controls i'm not

1244
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,319
going to tell them about every control

1245
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,280
that's out there i'm going to talk about

1246
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,440
control objectives are we trying to

1247
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,440
achieve a certain you know level of

1248
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,000
scanning or do we have certain levels of

1249
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,920
expectation around our policies so i'm

1250
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
going to roll things up more to an

1251
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,000
overview so that they can quickly

1252
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,760
understand okay what do you need to go

1253
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,200
drill down on what do i need to change

1254
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,800
my plan about

1255
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,880
additionally i think utilizing

1256
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,280
taxonomies or again grouping things

1257
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,680
together so i typically talk to my

1258
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,720
c-suites about strategic risks i talked

1259
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,359
about regulatory compliance risks

1260
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,359
operational risks and i don't get down

1261
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,520
into the little ones i actually talk

1262
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,599
about well you know my operational is my

1263
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,920
people process technology and business

1264
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,599
process um so or business

1265
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,839
transactions so that they understand

1266
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,280
okay that's what i'm saying when i say

1267
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,000
my operational risk is up or it's

1268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
increasing okay what does that mean to

1269
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
me and what do we need to do differently

1270
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,920
so rolling a lot of the information up

1271
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,480
for them and aggregating it at a higher

1272
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,960
level and then putting it in buckets and

1273
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,280
making it real to them is much

1274
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,880
easier to have the conversation and they

1275
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,800
understand because then you can drill

1276
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,280
down after but if you start too low then

1277
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,520
it just becomes too much of a well why

1278
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,000
is that more valuable than that why is

1279
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,319
one asset more valuable than another it

1280
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,440
has to be

1281
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,760
talked about the same and the other

1282
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,119
thing i found was

1283
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,760
really tricky is taking i.t and putting

1284
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,640
it in line with your other assets so if

1285
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,720
you have a business like i again i

1286
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
worked for an energy company um our

1287
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,880
assets and our fuels were the biggest

1288
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
thing for us they were our revenue

1289
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,480
generators but yet our it assets were

1290
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,160
running a lot of those and were really

1291
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
responsible for the backbone of those

1292
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,880
assets so i said it has to be an asset

1293
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,599
now and how do we have that conversation

1294
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,040
and those kind of conversations are

1295
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,000
changing you just have to understand

1296
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,520
how to

1297
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,359
group it together and then think about

1298
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,200
it as they're relevant and what the

1299
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,280
risks are to both of them

1300
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,359
because one of the things you'll find is

1301
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,800
you know the revenue generators are

1302
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,839
going to be

1303
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,680
what people focus on but when the

1304
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,079
revenue generators now are so heavily

1305
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,880
dependent on i.t and infrastructure

1306
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,319
that's one of the things you have to

1307
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
start changing that conversation and

1308
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,200
making it real to them

1309
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,880
so i have a few more minutes if anyone

1310
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,400
has a last

1311
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,280
question comment so i will say how many

1312
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,000
people feel they could put a cyber

1313
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
program or an is program together at

1314
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160
this point at least with one or two

1315
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,399
things

1316
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,560
great

1317
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,480
[Laughter]

1318
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,760
so again thank you um and i'm also

1319
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,680

1320
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,760
i'll be around um you can find me on

1321
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,960
