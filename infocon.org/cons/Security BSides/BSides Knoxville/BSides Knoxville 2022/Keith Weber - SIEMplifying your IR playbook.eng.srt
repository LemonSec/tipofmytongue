1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,120
hello everybody we're here to talk about

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,799
simplifying your ir playbook if you're

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,080
not sure what that is well it's the sim

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,920
and you have an ir playbook

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
and now you combine them together

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,040
so

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,599
um my name is keith weber i am a senior

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,119
information security engineer for a

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,359
company here in knoxville cellular sales

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,520
it's just right off of 40. you see the

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,279
big building big sign

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,599
i've been doing security for about 14 15

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,640
years now i have a bunch of

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
certifications that just means i can

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,199
regurgitate a book

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
but hopefully today what we're going to

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,239
draw out of this

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,719
discussion is how do we take our sim

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,559
does everybody know what a sim is before

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,160
i go on

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,960
okay

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
do you have an ir playbook

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
how many people have an ir playbook

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,000
don't be shy there you go

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
so now we're just going to talk about

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
those who don't have an ir playbook

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,960
we're going to just basically go over

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
and how we can integrate all the

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,719
different alerts and different

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
noise that our sim makes and how we

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
respond to it through a and it's not

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
working and cool

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,840
merry christmas

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,439
all right so that was the talk everybody

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,559
have a good time the bar is open

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
so that is true the bar is open so you

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
can go use your tickets now i'm not

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,479
going to be offended if you get up and

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,000
go and get a drink

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
speaking of which if anybody wants to

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,320
get me a drink that'd be cool

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
so um basically recapping really quick

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
how you take your sim

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
integrated with your playbook and how do

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
you do incident response whenever you

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
that thing the sim

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,320
uh alerts and kicks off

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
uh so basically in this discussion we

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,439
are going to go over briefly on what a

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,320
sem is and how it integrates with um our

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
everyday business

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
and then we're going to talk about the

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
ir playbook and david the speaker before

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
this did a great job of

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
presenting on what mitre attack is and

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
how minor attack can be

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,719
used in our environment

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,439
and

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
basically make us better security

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,840
professionals

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
so a sim

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,878
it is a it is our brain child it is the

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,120
the device that helps us and makes us

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
look good with senior management

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
so

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
what a basic boost is a log management

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
correlation analytic and incident

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
monitoring and security alerts and

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,879
compliance management reporting tool

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
cool

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,280
what does that mean

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
well we take all the events that every

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,239
single server makes all those events

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,760
that a host makes

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
and then something has got to process

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,319
and and take all that information in and

77
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,800
say this is kind of odd

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
maybe we should somebody should look at

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
that

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,440
so

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
there are many flavors or how we got to

82
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
the sim because back in the day there

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
was actually two components before the

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
sim came out the first component

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
i got to figure out where this mic is

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
right

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,480
the first component was the central uh

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
security information management tool

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
it just basically took all the log data

90
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
and did an analysis of it and then

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,080
eventually

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
a second component came about

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
and it became the system event

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
management and it did all the

95
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
correlation all the

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
noise that we don't want to sift through

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
one million logs a day

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
trying to figure out that this event id

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
triggered at the wrong time

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
and then eventually some marketing guy

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
said why don't we put them together

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
and now we have the sim the s-i-e-m it

103
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,920
is been seen also s-e-i-m but that's

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
just

105
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
wordplay

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
so there are many flavors of sims out

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
there

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
that some are really expensive some are

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
really cheap

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
some are open source and some have

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,959
proprietary

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,159
software

113
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
associated

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
with their code

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
each one

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
i'm sorry let me go back each one

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,560
has a unique flavor and some of them

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,439
even claim that they have the ability

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,640
to

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
do everything for you now this has some

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
pros and cons associated with it but for

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,720
the most part

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
you know they will do

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
a lot of alerting and what i can say

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,479
about the sim and

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
you have to tune it i don't care

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,160
if a sales person your sales manager

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
says we've got the one

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
solution that's going to solve all your

130
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
security threats and this is how it's

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
going to do it we've got it right here i

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,759
don't care you've got to tune your sim

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
every single time i have in my 14-year

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
career i've been on the government side

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
i've been a consultant i've been well

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,919
where i am now

137
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,040
and

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
all the different places i've been doing

139
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
a security assessment

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
the sim has never touched it has people

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
think that you can turn it on and it

142
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
will do what you want to do

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
but you will run into a lot of problems

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
if you are not

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
actively

146
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
in your sim

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
making sure you have all the correct

148
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
tools

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
properly configured

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
so the next topic of discussion is our

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,440
incident

152
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,759
incident response playbook

153
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
this is

154
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
a kicker this is the one that can be

155
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,520
overly complicated

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,759
or it can be very simplistic where it

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,919
doesn't tell you much of anything

158
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,400
i just recently got back from a forensic

159
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
conference

160
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
and there was it was a good conference

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
but it was more geared towards law

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
enforcement than it was security

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,080
professionals

164
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
um so

165
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
when the topic came up and one of the

166
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,479
sessions

167
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
came up and they were talking about

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
incident response

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
the gentleman was basing his incident

170
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
response off of computers

171
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
not necessary law enforcement so

172
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,479
obviously if you can imagine the law

173
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,039
enforcement incident response policy is

174
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
massive and there was a lot of questions

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
and it was a good conversation a lot of

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
these guys didn't have a clue

177
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
on what exactly happens behind the

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
scenes in a normal corporation they just

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
know what they know and there's nothing

180
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
wrong with that

181
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
an incident response policy or playbook

182
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
excuse me

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
just bringing the gap between chaos and

184
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
security

185
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
if you have i mean how many people here

186
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
like their incident response

187
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,960
cool one person awesome

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
so

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
this is a challenging

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
discussion or challenging topic for a

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,039
lot of

192
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
people in our industry

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
because of the fact that it can be

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
overly complicated

195
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,039
and

196
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,440
now here's another question in fact

197
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,639
first person to answer hans you might

198
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,919
get a price

199
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,520
how many people have printed out their

200
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,039
incident response playbook and is on

201
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,840
their desk

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
boom you work at y12 that's not fair you

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
have to that's the rule somebody pass

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
that back to him i don't want to throw

205
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
it at him

206
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
so it's always a good idea to have your

207
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
your ir playbook printed out just in

208
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,000
case you get that ransomware attack and

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
you have no clue

210
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
how to respond

211
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
and it's okay if you don't know how to

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
respond you just have to look like you

213
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
know what you're doing

214
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
i've done that before

215
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
i've worked

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
responded to my first ransomware attack

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,160
and i was working for a company down in

218
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
chattanooga and i walked in there and i

219
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,080
said yep that's a random ware

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
yep i don't know what to do

221
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
so it is important to understand how

222
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
your different internet response policy

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
excuse me

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
your incident response playbook

225
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
benefits you it's important to go

226
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
through your incident response playbook

227
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
using tabletop exercises or even if you

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
are want to be really clever and you

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
want to keep your analysts on their toes

230
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
you kick off a simulated

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
attack

232
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
and that's fun to do

233
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
and then you realize how many people on

234
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
your team look at the incident response

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
playbook

236
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,160
i'm looking at them right now

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
um

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,039
all right

239
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
so how do we

240
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
shoot did i click the right thing

241
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,919
all right

242
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
so what if you don't know

243
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
how to

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
start with your incident response

245
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
playbook so we've got the sim we know it

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
takes a lot of data we know it takes all

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
the logs it does all the hard work for

248
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
us and then you throw in some yara rules

249
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
you throw in some different types of

250
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
detection

251
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
and then

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
now we open the incident response book

253
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
we see that a a host in one of our

254
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
stores

255
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
downloaded malware

256
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,519
and what do we do

257
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
so there's different ways that we can go

258
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
about

259
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
creating our incident response playbook

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
and one of boy that is small

261
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
i'm standing right next to it

262
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,000
so

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
keep it simple

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
your incident

265
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
response playbook should be able to be

266
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
understood

267
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
at the most highest level and what i

268
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,440
mean by that is that

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,839
theoretically you i'm getting a phone

270
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
call theoretically

271
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
your

272
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
ceo or your cio

273
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
should be able to walk down look at your

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,920
incident response playbook and then

275
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,440
be able to follow through the process

276
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
now

277
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
i don't know what is what is the

278
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
likelihood of a ceo coming down looking

279
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
at your instant response look probably

280
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
low i know where we work

281
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
at cellular sales our senior leadership

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,600
is

283
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,519
actively engaged with the security

284
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,720
program

285
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
and if you don't have that i encourage

286
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
you to have sit downs and talk with them

287
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
on a regular basis not high level pain

288
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
no not very in the wii's conversations

289
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
but ask them what do you expect from

290
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,760
this

291
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,079
from the security department if this

292
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,399
happens what do i do and that should all

293
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
be identified at least in your incident

294
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
response policy

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
the other thing is you have to establish

296
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
roles okay so now you have all these

297
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
different you know parts to the incident

298
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,839
response

299
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
playbook how who's doing what do you

300
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
have an incident commander

301
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,240
who's who's handling all the forensics

302
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
who's handling uh who's working with the

303
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,519
different departments and technologies

304
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
you know all this has to be integrated

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
i'll stand right here

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
um

307
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
and then

308
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
apparently i can't stand anywhere

309
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
and then you have to

310
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
enter you know work with all the

311
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
different departments and then you need

312
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
to kick off your tabletop exercises

313
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
everybody needs to do a tabletop

314
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,839
exercises minimum of two years

315
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
just because incidents are typically

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
infrequent but that one time

317
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
that everybody's on the same page

318
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
and everybody's working together as one

319
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,680
team makes things easier in the long run

320
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
um

321
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
so

322
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,439
also

323
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
yep that's pretty much it on that

324
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
now david the previous presenter had a

325
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
really good talk on the mitre attack

326
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,680
framework i'm not going to go into it i

327
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
think he did a very good job on trying

328
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,160
to break down and this is a very high

329
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,040
level

330
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,839
approach to understanding how your sim

331
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,120
integrates with your ir playbook and

332
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
you know

333
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,880
so we won't go too indeed

334
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
but i will just add to that conversation

335
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
that what david said

336
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
this is a tremendous resource

337
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
i got to see a presentation from mitre

338
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
attack one time at rsa

339
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,000
and it just opened my eyes and i for now

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
forever included in our incident

341
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
response playbook the different uh ttps

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
or techniques tactics and procedures

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,310
that

344
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,800
[Music]

345
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
is associated with the miter attack

346
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
it's just

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
in your best interest to at least

348
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,639
look at the miter attack framework

349
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
see how each different technique

350
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
can be used

351
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,639
in your environment and then sometimes

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
you can even associate that with if you

353
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
have a risk register

354
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,720
or you have some kind of risk matrix

355
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
that can be introduced

356
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
and made things easy

357
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
down the road

358
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
so

359
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
this is a fantastic

360
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,720
framework to understand and it's not

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
just for security people i encourage if

362
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
you're on the system side

363
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
i encourage you to

364
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,040
are y'all hearing that feedback or is it

365
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,160
just me

366
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
okay

367
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,880
um maybe it's this other thing

368
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,519
we'll turn that off okay

369
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,959
um

370
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,160
i encourage all the different

371
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
departments including networking

372
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
including infrastructure including your

373
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
ops team if you have a support desk help

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
desk whatever i encourage them to go

375
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,920
look at it because this will give them

376
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
different ideas or different

377
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
perspectives uh how these different

378
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
attacks work just makes things better

379
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,639
for everybody in the long run

380
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
all right now let's just blend it all

381
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,839
together this is the hard part this is

382
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
i mean i look at

383
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
my incident response playbook every day

384
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
and i still don't know if it's the right

385
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,440
one

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
i still don't know

387
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
if everything

388
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
is done the way that it's supposed to

389
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
in an effective uh manner and the only

390
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,959
way that i know that we are doing

391
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,240
everything correctly is we do have those

392
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
um

393
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
table top exercises

394
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
on that point and at this conference i

395
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,279
learned something new and i didn't

396
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
realize that the taxpayers us were

397
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
paying for it and it's completely free

398
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
there is a federal agency called cisa

399
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,199
cisa

400
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,079
they

401
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,120
give

402
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
pen tests risk assessments

403
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
tabletop exercises the whole nine yards

404
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
and it's free

405
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
and uh i said

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
luckily the one of the presenters was

407
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,360
the representative for tennessee

408
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
and i had a great conversation with them

409
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
they will come on site they will

410
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
customize and make your their excuse me

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
they will customize

412
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
a tabletop exercise man i want country

413
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,959
right there

414
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,480
shoot my eight senior slaves coming out

415
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
um they will come through and they will

416
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
create a custom tabletop exercise for

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
you

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
and then work with through you and also

419
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,199
take a look at your incident response

420
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,399
policy tweak it where they think is best

421
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
the great thing is they don't report

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
anything they don't record anything they

423
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,040
are there to help you i didn't realize

424
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
that it was tax funded taxpayer funded

425
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
but

426
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,199
i told my manager i said hey we need to

427
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,600
start using their service because

428
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,639
it can only make us better

429
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
so that's just i think it's just

430
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,120
cisa.gov

431
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
and then you can go see

432
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,519
who your representative is and you can

433
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,279
email them directly the guys were

434
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,959
terrific

435
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,360
they are government so

436
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
they they do follow very stringent nist

437
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,199
guidelines

438
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,680
and everything is based on the

439
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
dod framework pretty much

440
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
okay so now how do we blend all this

441
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,720
together how do we make

442
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
our sim

443
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,079
and our incident response playbook and

444
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
our minor attack

445
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
and we

446
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
do it

447
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,480
make this beautiful bob ross painting

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
and just a side note if anybody in half

449
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
has kids

450
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
and if you want your kids to shut up

451
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,680
put bob ross on i'm not kidding it's on

452
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,279
netflix and for some reason that nice

453
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
soft sultry voice

454
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
will chill kids

455
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,758
it's crazy

456
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
so how do we blend it all together how

457
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
do we

458
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
take all those different components and

459
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
we make

460
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
this

461
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,959
beautiful

462
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,560
incident response plan that we can

463
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
present to our senior management and

464
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
they think we're fantastic and it's like

465
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
wow we need to pay you more

466
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
it's not going to happen i'm going to

467
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
tell you that right now

468
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,199
um

469
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,319
but you could you can dream

470
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,280
um

471
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
so

472
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
it's easy okay i'm gonna go back to what

473
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,119
i said a moment ago keep it simple

474
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
start working through the different

475
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
frameworks within the minor attack

476
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
framework

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
and figure out okay

478
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,880
now that i have my sim just alerted and

479
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
it says

480
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,439
john doe

481
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,280
has an irregular time sign in at two

482
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,039
o'clock

483
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
what do i do

484
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
okay well if i go to my playbook and i

485
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
look in and at that specific technique

486
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,919
and i'm looking for

487
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
okay it says well i've got a regular

488
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
login time so maybe i need to go check

489
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
you know all the different um

490
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
time parameters and what time do they

491
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
log in or what time is their normal work

492
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,280
schedule

493
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,679
um okay well that's kind of odd now

494
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,000
we've got to cl you know this uh john

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
doe

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,039
he normally on average he signs into

497
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
work around 8 30 but he's never doing it

498
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,559
at uh three in the morning oh yeah by

499
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,120
the way he just connected to the vpn

500
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,039
well that's strange don doe doesn't have

501
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,960
a vpn profile

502
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
now my

503
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
my heart rate's racing

504
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
now i've got to figure out

505
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,880
why

506
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
does john doe

507
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
sign in

508
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,679
at three in the morning on a vpn profile

509
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,720
now

510
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
well we got to work through it so

511
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
there is an actual technique

512
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
on the miter attack framework that will

513
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
go through the vpn connections and it

514
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
will tell you that this technique is

515
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,760
used and this is the

516
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,799
this is what the attributes are on how

517
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,919
to go about detecting it so then you put

518
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
that into your playbook that you should

519
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
check this area this area this area

520
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,720
now you go to your sim you run your

521
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
queries that you're looking for

522
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,400
and then okay cool well now i know it

523
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,039
was an international ip address

524
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,880
oddly enough we didn't block russia on

525
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
the firewall

526
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
and okay cool now we're kicking it off

527
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,600
now we're quarantining now

528
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
depending on how within your playbook

529
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
do you quarantine do you want to leave

530
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
it open

531
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,640
um so you can collect more data

532
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
is it possibly insider insider threat

533
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,480
these are different ideas that you all

534
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
have to talk amongst your team

535
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
and this is where the tabletop exercise

536
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
comes into and only becomes a benefit

537
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
for your team

538
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,799
on the table top exercises

539
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,480
include your senior management whether

540
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
it's your

541
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
your managers or your ciso or your cio

542
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,240
include them because they have

543
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
different observations that you may not

544
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
be aware of

545
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
and it only can benefit you if you

546
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
include them now

547
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
i wouldn't include them for the full two

548
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,679
hour session just say hey can you come

549
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,600
in here for 30 minutes and would be cool

550
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
great oh by the way it's at lunch i need

551
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,080
you to flip lunch bill please that'd be

552
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
great

553
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
you can help us out

554
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,080
um

555
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,880
so

556
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,430
we include all these different

557
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,600
[Music]

558
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
ideas these different you know

559
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
components and we introdu you know and

560
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,640
we put into our instant response plugs

561
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,039
and we make things

562
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,240
um easier on the analyst

563
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
or the different

564
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
infrastructure your systems person

565
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
to

566
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
pull the information and to quarantine

567
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
it and work with your different

568
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,880
different departments

569
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
um

570
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
so the good news is

571
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,679
i didn't realize i talked very fast

572
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
so lunch is pretty soon so

573
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
the next slide

574
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
conclusion

575
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
so we can be at the front of the line

576
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,200
yes

577
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
take that other group

578
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,799
um

579
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,120
i kind of went through fast because this

580
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
is the second time i've ever third time

581
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
i've ever spoke and so this is very

582
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,320
nerve-wracking being up here

583
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,400
one thing i can tell you

584
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
of all the years that i've been doing

585
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,559
this is take your time and i know in our

586
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
industry time is not something we

587
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
usually have

588
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
time is just our enemy

589
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
uh most of the time

590
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
but if you take your time and you build

591
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
out each technique into your incident

592
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
response playbook

593
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
and then you correlate that playbook

594
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,679
with your sim

595
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,520
so when you know you get that alert at

596
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
two o'clock in the morning because of

597
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
john doe

598
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,760
access not normal

599
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,120
you know that you can turn to that

600
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,799
playbook and you can follow through it

601
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,559
and you can eliminate

602
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,639
a much time headache and stress

603
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,080
and i can't stress enough

604
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
doing tabletop exercises

605
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
it only builds all your teams together

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,280
more chrome together more tighter

607
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
and then also

608
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,000
other departments get to learn what you

609
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
do

610
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
i mean most security professionals have

611
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
an idea of what networking does

612
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,640
what

613
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,679
a system does what ops does but a lot of

614
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
people don't understand what exactly

615
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
security does you know

616
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
we use bloodhound at our

617
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,919
in our department

618
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
and bloodhound can give you

619
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
huge visibility

620
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
into different active directory

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,720
permissions and different

622
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
controls

623
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
and we also use other cool tools

624
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
that

625
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,280
the different departments want to use

626
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
and that's another issue another thing

627
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
i'd like to bring up

628
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
security preferentials we like to be

629
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
tight-knit we like to be close we like

630
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,559
to keep everything to ourselves

631
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
i think and this is just my opinion in

632
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
my opinion only does not reflect opinion

633
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,159
of cellular sales

634
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,679
but the good news is my boss has the

635
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,200
same opinion so i can say it

636
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
we need to be more open about our tools

637
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
we need to share

638
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
our tools with other departments now i'm

639
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,440
not saying give them admin rights i'm

640
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
not saying they can have the right to

641
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,120
configure anything i'm just saying

642
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,720
that they need to see what we see

643
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
and that only makes us better

644
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,840
you know

645
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
we should not be the stop gap that

646
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
prohibits the company from moving

647
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,960
forward

648
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,000
you know

649
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,679
that's just my personal belief thank you

650
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,840
for listening

651
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,559
but

652
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,879
um

653
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
damn that was quick

654
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,320
um you know we'll open it now to qa i

655
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
have one more thing to give out

656
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,200
i'm not sure what it is what is it it's

657
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,279
like a back door thing back doors and

658
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,760
breaches stickers

659
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,559
oh it's just stickers

660
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,000
oh okay cool

661
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,760
well if the sticker's missing i took it

662
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,799
um

663
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,400
kyle go ahead

664
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,919
hey yes

665
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
uh

666
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,320
do you have recommendations on time

667
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
yeah so

668
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,559
so there's different uh what kyle asks

669
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
is

670
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
is there in the incident response

671
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
tabletop exercises or you engage in a in

672
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
a live demonstration of your

673
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,360
of your sim what tools are available out

674
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,880
there that can

675
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
alert you or help you

676
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,840
identify

677
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
or basically

678
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
test your sim and make sure that you are

679
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
configured correctly

680
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
so the one of the great tools is

681
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
obviously your brain

682
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,480
just you know

683
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
putting a linux machine out there

684
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,320
and then putting it with a lot of ocean

685
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
a lot of

686
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,200
different tools github go to github

687
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,679
and then download anything so

688
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,640
uh

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,279
there are some websites i'm a little

690
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
um i'm not i can't think of the one

691
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,159
right now

692
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,159
that will actively

693
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
use benign code and that will drop a

694
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,600
payload i know if you use some

695
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,799
software like proofpoint you can use

696
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
benign malware that will distribute

697
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,480
email out to our users and then if they

698
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
click on it

699
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
we'll see if our endpoint protection is

700
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,720
working we'll see if we get an alert

701
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,799
notification on our sim

702
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,200
and then we will then correlate that to

703
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
our incident response playbook and to

704
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
make sure everything works well together

705
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
sorry i don't have the website there's a

706
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,039
cool website that

707
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,360
that will you can download the payload

708
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
and then just get your

709
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
one of your laptops and distribute it

710
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
and see if you can piss off your system

711
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,919
any other question here kyle do you

712
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,610
really want this

713
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,080

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
want it

719
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,880
i found at some um and you talked about

720
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,320
open sourcing heard of sharing

721
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,440
and i recently found just a repository

722
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
on git lab that is

723
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
uh

724
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
institutional consequences very well

725
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
built out so

726
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
did everybody hear that

727
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,640
all right hold on let me walk down

728
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
that was very well said so i'ma let him

729
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,760
talk

730
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,480
i don't know that i can do it again um

731
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
uh we were recently building our

732
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,960
instance response playbook so i just

733
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
want to give a plug for something that i

734
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,880
found that uh i'm entirely unaffiliated

735
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
with but if you're just searching google

736
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,480
for like gitlab instance response

737
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
playbooks public i think you'll find a

738
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
repository that has very well built out

739
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,760
workflows for various instances so i

740
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,080
just want to throw it out these days

741
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,360

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,799
all right

751
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
together

752
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,639
and what's your question

753
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
that you were talking about yeah sorry

754
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
you did

755
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,840
so

756
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,399
first that you were talking about

757
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,880
is the are the representative

758
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,840
names on the site

759
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,960
yep yeah on their website and

760
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
you know i wasn't planning on talking

761
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,600
about system because i just learned

762
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
about them the other day

763
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,399
um

764
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,000
yes on their website they actually have

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
um

766
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,360
their folks breaking out into regions so

767
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
the guy who represents tennessee also

768
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
represents uh georgia

769
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,200
and

770
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,480
florida

771
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,640
and he is based out of atlanta georgia

772
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,480
he said he's very interested in

773
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,520
traveling meeting people now that we've

774
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,919
lessened our coveted restrictions so he

775
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,760
enjoys being on site

776
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
he has a team about six in his

777
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
department and

778
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
they come the great thing is is travel

779
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
is paid by the government

780
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,679
um

781
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,919
all their food expenses everything is

782
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,480
paid all you have to do

783
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,240
is invite them i mean i guess they're

784
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
vampires so you have to invite them to

785
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,799
the

786
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,440
door so

787
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,840
but uh

788
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,080
all right any other questions oh hey

789
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,559
oh shoot man that's a dangerous question

790
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,360
the question was how how broad

791
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,080
is and how broad is it to make your ir

792
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,559
playbook

793
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,320
you can make it so complicated with so

794
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,240
many moving pieces with so many

795
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
different people

796
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,559
that

797
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,840
you get into the finger pointing game

798
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,399
my advice when creating in your playbook

799
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,559
and then you're like

800
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,440
you're about to get show and tell

801
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,960
so this is just a copy of our

802
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,679
does that show up

803
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,120
so i am in the process of

804
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,678
redoing this

805
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
so

806
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
this is a copy of our

807
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,799
incident response playbook please no

808
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
flash photography this is proprietary

809
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
information and i will change it

810
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,679
um

811
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,880
so

812
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,279
in the playbook that i design

813
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,720
i like colors

814
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,399
it makes it easier for everybody to see

815
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,480
their responsibilities and jobs

816
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,399
so if there is

817
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
uh i know it's hard to see

818
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,120
but

819
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
is a first part to our playbook this is

820
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,159
just the beginning this is

821
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,039
is this an event or is this an incident

822
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,840
okay so there's a separate uh document

823
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,559
uh that explains the general actions

824
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,600
okay and this incident response playbook

825
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,960
was designed after the nist uh cr crf

826
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,039
and they also have the nist

827
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,919
867

828
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,159
is a great incident response

829
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
documentation this does a great job they

830
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
they like to overload you with

831
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,679
information

832
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,360
and um

833
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,080
so i just redid ours here pretty soon in

834
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
two weeks we have a tabletop exercises

835
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
to make sure that we work through any

836
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,360
type of malware that occurs that we are

837
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,399
currently

838
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,440
collecting the necessary information

839
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,320
so

840
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,000
there is a section here for incident

841
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,679
handlers

842
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,360
and there is a section for our

843
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,919
infrastructure team

844
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,399
then we make sure that we're collecting

845
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,559
all the necessary information

846
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,799
we have a great epp tool

847
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,919
at cellular cells that also does our

848
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,360
forensics

849
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,480
so

850
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,919
you know if and

851
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,240
we can anybody wants to talk after this

852
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,559
i can help give you some other direction

853
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,559
on what i've seen over the years that

854
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,640
has helped me

855
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,440
but

856
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
color coordination to me is fantastic

857
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
because i know where to go

858
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,440
uh then we have an incident commander

859
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
this is an instant commander and our

860
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,679
incident response policy is the person

861
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,519
who

862
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
is going to be the liaison talking to

863
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,799
senior management should they be

864
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,240
involved you know talking to our

865
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
director to making sure they are on top

866
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,399
of what's going on

867
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,919
and so this is just kind of our process

868
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,120
um

869
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,360
you know

870
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,640
um

871
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
the is just information security is

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,360
infrastructure

873
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,279
and if y'all notice

874
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
that there are little

875
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,679
there's containment

876
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,399
these are all based off the nest crs the

877
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,200
eradication processes the recovery

878
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,159
process the lessons learned process

879
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,200
and

880
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,919
stop talking

881
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,320
um so that's just kind of you know our

882
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,360
example you know

883
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
so i hope that answers your question i

884
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
know it's very hard to answer that

885
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,159
question because

886
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,320
it's up to the person who is responsible

887
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,919
for that document

888
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,240
yep sure

889
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
so that's a very good question is which

890
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,279
framework do you use

891
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
i am in the process of changing ours to

892
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,600

893
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
the mitre attack framework

894
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,960

895
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,480
